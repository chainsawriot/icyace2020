environments. 280 participants (140 dyads) were randomly assigned to communicate with each other via avatar-mediated platforms that varied in their capacity to deliver nonverbal cues. Dyads that were able to see their partner’s facial movements being mapped on to their avatars liked each other more and formed more accurate impressions about their partners compared to those unable to see facial movements. Furthermore, the two nonverbal channels interacted such that dyads that could see their partner’s facial movements described their interaction experiences more positively compared to those unable to see facial movements, but only when their partner’s bodily gestures were also available. Behaviorally, dyads showed greater bodily and facial nonverbal synchrony (i.e., their movements were correlated) when they could see their partner’s bodily and facial movements. The present study also employed machine learning algorithms to explore whether tracked nonverbal cues would be able to predict interpersonal attraction through an inductive process. These classifiers could predict high and low interpersonal attraction individuals at an accuracy rate that ranged between 14-17% higher than the majority class baseline. The most predictive features in the models were related to synchrony of smiling behavior.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores the ability of virtual reality to decrease outgroup prejudice or social distance. Raising the salience of (a) individuals’ real physical identity through avatar customization and (b) common ingroup identity priming was theorized to influence social distance. Participants who customized an avatar to resemble their real selves showed increased social distance. In contrast, participants whom customized an avatar to resemble their real selves experienced increased perceived identifiability, with perceived identifiability linked to affective polarization reduction. Participants with high and moderate pre-existing involvement with immigration showed increased social distance after customizing an avatar to resemble their real selves, thus implying boomerang effects. Common ingroup primes did not influence social distance. The study discusses how avatar customization, perceived identifiability, and common ingroup primes in virtual encounters may influence outgroup social distance.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The present investigation examined the effect of avatar representation, choice, and head movement on prosocial behaviors and measures of presence after a virtual reality perspective-taking (VRPT) task. Participants were either represented by a set of virtual hands, or had no representation while completing a VRPT task. Of those with hands, only half were able to choose their skin tone. Results showed that there was no significant advantage to having an avatar representation. However, if participants had an avatar and were able to choose their own skin tone, participants signed more petitions and reported higher social presence scores compared to participants who had no choice. Regardless of condition, head rotations significantly predicted petition signatures such that the more participants rotated their heads side to side, the more likely they were to sign the petition. Moreover, when participants do not constantly rotate their head during the VRPT task, the proportion of petitions signed is on par with individuals who do not complete a VRPT task at all.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Avatar-based self-influence in text-based CMC was examined through the lens of self-perception theory and the Proteus effect. Avatar embodiment is discussed as a moderator for the Proteus effect, as well as the need for inducing this embodiment in experimental studies in order to observe evidence of the Proteus effect. Two possible methods for inducing embodiment are tested along with a proposed model for the Proteus effect in social media environments. Significance in this study was found for main effect of a familiarity task on perceptions of avatar embodiment, an interaction effect of avatar embodiment and avatar condition on aggressive behavior, and an unpredicted main effect of embodiment on aggressive attitude. Results are discussed as are possible explanations for the observed effect of embodiment on aggression<i>.<\/i><br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>Proteus effect, CMC, avatar, embodiment, self-perception theory\n","Abstract Body: Human memory is the dual process of remembering and forgetting. Comparing with human memory, individuals’ disclosed information on social media can be remembered and preserved persistently. The persistent data result in information privacy concern when social media users enjoy benefits from applying media technology. Ephemerality as a new technical innovation focusing on temporary online sharing counteracts information privacy concerns while promoting active media usage. ‘Viewable by Friends’ privacy setting of <i>Moments<\/i> on WeChat, as an unique ephemerality functionality, enables a balance between privacy concern and the need of information sharing on social media. In spite of high practice relevance, no such research has insight into how ephemerality impacts on users’ cognitive mechanisms of temporal online sharing through using the specific privacy setting. This study seeks to fill in the gap under the structure of privacy calculus theory regarding benefit-risk analysis to see the influence of ephemerality on the tension between information privacy concern and personal information disclosure on our social world. This study develops a research model and test it with 302 ‘Viewable by Friends’ active users’ participation. It is found that perceived ephemerality effectively motivates users’ continued usage intention by decreasing perceived severity and perceived intrusion toward privacy concerns while increasing perceived usefulness and perceived controllability.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <i>Communicative contingency<\/i> refers to the degree to which a communicator’s messages are guided by and relative to previous exchanges in an interaction. Generally considered a stable property of face-to-face communication, communication technologies—particularly ephemeral chat tools like Snapchat that only retain the last message exchanged—increasingly present means by which contingency can be manipulated. This manuscript reports the results of two complementary studies: a survey (Study 1; <i>N<\/i> = 157) exploring interaction characteristics and relational attributes of a Snapchat and a text target and an experiment (Study 2; <i>N<\/i> = 32) in which dyads engaged in a 10-minute text-based mediated discussion. Grounded in social information processing theory, findings support the hypothesized reduction of communicative contingency in ephemeral channels, as well as increased perceptions of social presence when interacting in channels where prior exchanges are persistent. Findings regarding the effect of contingency on social attraction were more complicated, suggesting social attraction may be related to contingency only during initial stages of relational development. These results indicate that ephemeral channels like Snapchat, popularized for increased security and privacy, may reduce the relational outcomes for their users.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined how self-presentation on social media influences the way people view themselves. It also examined whether that varies with sites using two common features: posts which have a short life and are automatically deleted (ephemeral) and those which live indefinitely (permanent). Drawing on both the notion of public commitment and media appropriateness, this study provided a critical test of two rival theory-driven hypotheses — one suggesting a greater internalization of self-presentation behaviors on permanent rather than ephemeral social media and the other suggesting the opposite pattern. Supporting the media appropriateness perspective, those who publicly presented themselves as introverts on ephemeral social media internalized their portrayed personality more compared to those who presented on permanent social media. Results suggest that conceiving of ephemeral social media as appropriate for true self-expression may facilitate internalization. Implications for understanding self-concept change in social media contexts are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Just as social media has permeated communication in our public and private lives, it has also become a widely used source of data and object of study in academic and industry research. Despite widespread use, relatively little is known about how social media datasets change when observed at different points over time or how collection methods may impact the data at the core of research projects. In this paper we examine how social media datasets change over time and how these changes impact their reliability and authenticity. Three Twitter-based case studies, each exhibiting prototypical elements social scientists encounter in their research, are used to demonstrate the impact of research design and data collection choices. This work brings the importance of methodological considerations to the forefront of studies of digital and social media. Empirical observations inform a set of implications for social media research, offering researchers practical considerations to inform their research designs.<\/i>\n",null,"Abstract Body: Despite the widespread usage of algorithms on online platforms, they remain largely covert and opaque to online users. This highlights the importance of exploring whether people are aware of algorithmic content recommendations. Although some studies have already investigated <i>algorithmic awareness<\/i>, no standardized instrument has been developed yet to assess this construct. In this study, we therefore developed and validated the Algorithmic Media Content Awareness Scale (AMCA-scale). This scale contains four underlying dimensions: 1) users’ awareness of content filtering, 2) users’ awareness of automated decision-making, 3) users’ awareness of human-algorithm interplay, and 4) users’ awareness of ethical considerations. In validating the scale, results revealed strong psychometrics properties. The AMCA-scale was also successfully tested for three different media platforms: Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube, showing its robustness over different contexts. Based on these findings, we conclude that the AMCA-scale offers scholars a valid, reliable and robust tool to measure algorithmic awareness.\n","Abstract Body: Guided by the heuristic-systematic model, this study aims to investigate the processing of AI-generated content. An experimental survey was conducted with a 2 (author: AI vs. human) X 3 (genre: news vs. poetry vs. painting) factorial design in the US, China, and Germany, as those three countries greatly reflect different stances in the spectrum of attitude toward AI. This study demonstrated that American responses were more skewed toward negative estimations of the AI version of content; Chinese responses were significantly more positive with the higher assessment of AI-authored content; and German responses reflected a conservative favour toward AI-generated content. Respondents’ attitude toward AI and perceived novelty of AI cast positive influence over their appraisals of AI-generated content; while the perceived threat negatively predicted the perceived quality, competence and intent to share the AI-generated content. <br /> <br />Keywords:<br />AI-generated content; Experimental survey; Cross-cultural comparison; Perception; Heuristic-systematic model<br />\n","Abstract Body: Through incorporating the roles of source attractiveness, source credibility, and influencer-follower parasocial interaction in the influencer persuasion process, we proposed a conceptual model entitled “social media relational credibility model” (SMRCM). To test SMRCM, we adopted a combined use of machine learning-based topic analysis and deep learning-based image analysis in order to examine the content of captions and photos contained in Instagram posts. These 7,745 posts were uploaded by the top ten young adult beauty and fashion social media influencers. Moreover, we analyzed the disclosure language in each post as well as the engagement performance (i.e., number of likes, number of comments) of the post. Results provided empirical support for SMRCM. In particular, based upon source attractiveness, source credibility, and the established influencer-follower parasocial interaction, a social media influencer develops one’s relational credibility in a particular domain of interest and this relational credibility is unlikely to be undermined by the sponsorship disclosure in the influencer’s posts. Implications and future research directions were provided.\n","Abstract Body: With the flourishing of new communication technologies, virtual reality (VR) is in full swing. Research on the use of VR in advertising is still in its infancy. Therefore, this study investigates the application of VR technology in advertising and examines the advertising effect of virtual experiences. An experiment with a 2 (immersive VR experience: high vs. low) × 2 (virtual experience product control: high vs. low) × 2 (virtual experience product stimulation: high vs. low) between-subject design was conducted. The results show that virtual experiences with high immersion can lead to better attitude toward the advertisement compared to virtual experiences with low immersion; and virtual experiences with high product control can generate better attitude toward the advertisement compared to the effects with virtual experience immersion with low product control. Interestingly, the virtual experience product stimulation did not directly influence the effect of advertising. Rather, the two-way interaction between virtual experience product stimulation and immersive VR experience or between virtual experience product stimulation and virtual experience product control, can generate better brand attitude and purchase intention. In addition, telepresence and perceived enjoyment, respectively, mediate the relationship between “immersion × control × stimulation” and attitude toward the advertisement.\n","Abstract Body: Sponsored advertising posted in newsfeeds on social media has been an important marketing strategy recently. Applying the theory of technology fluidity and the flow construct in an experiment, this study explores how product type (think vs. feel) and product involvement (high vs. low) influence consumers’ interaction with a newsfeed ad on Facebook, and how such interaction shapes their evaluation of the ad and the brand. Results show that both product type and product involvement influenced flow immersion in the ad. While only product type affected immersion in the ad, sense of control was not influenced by either factor.  Product type was also a significant predictor of attitude toward the ad, whereas product involvement exerted a significant impact on purchase intention; attitude toward the brand was affected by both factors. Finally, fluidity-- as well as flow immersion and perceived sense of control-- all predicted attitude toward the ad.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: The aim of the present study was to conceptualize and develop new measurement instruments to assess adolescents’ a) exposure to, b) liking of and c) posting of ideal content on social media. By means of an integrative review of the literature, six focus group interviews and fourteen in-depth interviews, nineteen items were developed to measure interactions with ideal content on social media. The psychometric properties of the three scales were established in a cross-sectional survey study among 294 adolescents (12-18 years old). Through EFA and CFA, the study extracted two valid and reliable factors for exposure to ideal social media content (i.e., exposure to an ideal life in general and exposure to ideal appearances), one valid and reliable factor for liking ideal social media content, and three valid and reliable factors for posting ideal social media content (i.e., posts about one’s interesting and happy (social) life, posts about ideal appearances and posts that show being good at things). These novel scales are expected to advance future survey research on adolescents’ social media interactions and experiences.\n","Abstract Body: As smart phones and social media penetrate the daily lives of adolescents, the impact of adolescents’ media use on their mental health has been of great interest for scientists in communication, psychology, public health, and other related disciplines. This current research aimed to identify whether media use for social interaction decreases adolescents’ depression, life satisfaction, and social withdrawal. More specifically, we distinguished two types of media use for social interaction: mobile phone use for communication and the use of social media. Based on a two-wave, nationally representative panel data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), this study used the fixed effects model to show that mobile phone use for communication did not have a statistically significant effect on the three mental health indicators; whereas social media use increased depression and social withdrawal and decreased life satisfaction. This link remained statistically significant even after controlling for other time-varying predictors of adolescents’ mental health. We discuss implications for youth communicative media use and its’ impact on their mental health.\n","Abstract Body: Recent research has explored the negative effects of Internet and digital technology use on children and young people’s mental health and wellbeing. Relying on the results of the 2018 EU Kids Online[1] survey in Norway on a nationally representative sample of 9-17-year-old Internet using children, this article examines how time spent online, digital technology use and negative online experiences, relate to children’s self-reported wellbeing. Using a regression analysis, we examine these effects in the context of demographic, individual and family-level factors. Our results indicate that the effects of Internet and digital technology use are mediated primarily by family and parental mediation-related variables and can hardly be understood outside of this offline context. Our analytical model indicates that in a supportive family context, the more time children spend online, the happier they are. The results are interpreted from the perspective of the Nordic model of childhood and upbringing and the media panics framework.<br /><br /><br />[1] http://www.lse.ac.uk/media-and-communications/research/research-projects/eu-kids-online<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: A large body of literature has investigated the association between social media use and well-being among adolescents. Yet, insights into person-to-person differences are lacking. This study employed a within-person approach, using intensive longitudinal data. A sample of 63 adolescents participated in a week-long experience sampling study. Six times per day, adolescents reported their momentary well-being and their active and passive use of the three platforms they most frequently used, yielding a total of 2,155 assessments. Multi-level analyses showed that, on average, adolescents reported higher well-being when they had passively used Instagram and WhatsApp. Furthermore, on average, adolescents reported that they felt better when they had spent more time actively using social media (across platforms) and passively using WhatsApp. Associations varied from adolescent to adolescent. While most adolescents did not experience differences in well-being when spending more time passively using Instagram (83%), some felt worse (7%), and others felt better (10%).\n","Abstract Body: The convergence of online gambling and the virtual economy surrounding video games increasingly impacts children’s entertainment culture. Relying on the qualitative data of self-reports from preadolescents and their parents, this study investigates how family dynamics interact and create a particular sociocultural, domestic context that shapes preadolescents’ connected and converged sites of play. Twenty semi-structured in-depth interviews with elicitation prompts were administered in 10 [anonymized] families with 11- to 12-year-olds. The results show that parents and teenagers do not (yet) critically grasp phenomena of convergence between (sports) gambling and video games, notwithstanding the prevalence of these dynamics in children’s leisure time. Parents do, however, hold nuanced beliefs and attitudes that depend on situational demands and perceived characteristics of connectivity. Different socialization dynamics were revealed for the media under investigation. The findings have important implications for 21st century media research, parental mediation theory and media (‘ludo’) literacy frameworks.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigated the effect of game rewards. In a 2 (achievement system: social vs. personal) x 2 (context: in-game vs. out-game) between-subjects design, 178 children (8-12 years) were randomly assigned to one of the four game reward conditions. Playing a serious videogame was followed by a self-report questionnaire. Findings indicated that a personal achievement system and out-game rewards increased children’s motivation to make healthy food choices via game engagement (attention, frustration, satisfaction).\n","Abstract Body: Building on the influence-of-presumed-influence model, this study empirically examined a theory-driven model, testing the direct and indirect effects of violent video game playing on adolescents' aggressive behavior. This theoretical framework was tested with the data of 1097 adolescents from China Education Panel Survey (CEPS). Results showed that video game playing not only had a direct effect on Chinese adolescents' aggressive behavior, but also exerted an indirect effect on teenagers' aggressive behavior. This indirect effect was mediated by adolescents' perceptions of the peer norm of playing video games and the peer norm of aggression. The indirect and under-explored path may have practical implications for educators.\n","Abstract Body: The aim of this study was to examine trajectories of pathological video game symptoms over a six-year period from adolescence to emerging adulthood. We also examined a number of predictors and outcomes for different trajectories. Participants included 385 adolescents (<i>M <\/i>age = 15.01 at the initial time point) who completed multiple questionnaires once a year over a six-year period. Analyses showed there were three distinct trajectories. Approximately 10% of adolescents (called “increasing symptoms”) showed moderate levels of pathological gaming symptoms at the initial time point and then increases in symptoms over time. Conversely, 18% of adolescents (called “moderate symptoms”) started with moderate symptoms that did not change over time. Finally, 72% of adolescents (called “non-pathological”) were relatively low in symptoms across the six years of data collection. Being male predicted both the increasing and moderate groups. The increasing group tended to show the worst outcomes over time, with higher levels of depression, aggression, delinquency, problematic cell phone use, and lower empathy and prosocial behavior than the non-pathological group. However, the non-pathological group was more likely to be shy than either group at the final time point.<br />\n","Abstract Body: A growing number of celebrities advocate for climate change actions on social media. As social media posts by celebrities are often trending topics and fans are interested in spreading the words of celebrities, their green voices in social media can catalyze public engagement. Grounded in Bandura’s social cognitive theory, framing, and information sharing, this study addresses the leverage of celebrities as climate advocates and effective message framing in disseminating climate advocacy on Twitter. In a 2 (celebrity) x 2 (emotion frame) x 2 (personal involvement frame) design (<i>N <\/i>= 693), this study explored the effects of message frames, parasocial relationship, and perceived authenticity of advocacy on retweeting and replying. Parasocial relationship and perceived authenticity of advocacy were strong positive predictors of retweeting and replying to celebrities’ climate messages. Fear-framed messages were more effective than hope-framed messages in promoting the likelihood of retweeting and replying. There was no effect of celebrity involvement frame. These findings suggest that high profile celebrities can be influential in mobilizing public engagement in environmental movements through word of mouth, depending on their connection to audiences, perceived motivation, and message framing. Specifically, celebrity climate change tweets were more effective when the celebrities had a stronger bond with audiences and were seen as authentic in their practices, and when fear was used to frame environmental topics.\n","Abstract Body: Social media platforms such as Twitter are becoming increasingly important as a political forum for campaigning, propaganda, and mobilization. As a result, there are mounting concerns that at least in the United States, the information environment on Twitter is fragmented along ideological lines with users ensconced into one of two polarized camps with limited exposure to cross-cutting views. However, there is little quantitative evidence for this claim, typically relying on methods that use small populations of political elites for assessing the extent of political polarization on the platform. This study makes several advancements over the existing body of literature by first, putting political elites in the larger context of the American Twittersphere, and second, by weighting the ideologies of Twitter elites by their tweeting activity. We find little evidence of polarization in how information is produced on Twitter at an elite level. Finally, we use a network analytic technique to assess the level of selective exposure on Twitter by building a coexposure network, and find that the Twitter consumption landscape is characterized by the presence of ideological echo-chambers.\n","Abstract Body: This study captures the #MeToo movement in South Korea to examine the development of framing in social media, and understand their increasing role as a central platform for public discourse. We apply various computational methods to analyze how the #MeToo movement was discussed by citizens in social media, contrasting it to the dominant frames in the mainstream news media. Our findings suggest that social media, while primarily serving as the platform to motivate and empower a social movement can simultaneously allow the development and proliferation of a narrative that disparages the movement. Moreover, we analyze all comments to the online news articles in our dataset and find that public discourse develop in contrasting ways depending on the features and mode of communication.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores the role of fear of isolation, willingness to self-censor, and opinion climates in people’s willingness to speak out, mainly when discussing the #MeToo movement. Using an online survey, the findings indicate that people believe the online environment creates a supportive atmosphere toward recent gender issues and feminism movements. In discussing #MeToo, people’s contextual fear of isolation increases their willingness to speak out, while the willingness to self-censor discourages their opinion expression. The perception of opinion climates was not a significant predictor.\n","Abstract Body: Sexual and violent content are prevalent in movies, and decision-making around responsibilities and risks of sexual activity and aggression are rarely included. Adolescents who are exposed to this content in movies may be particularly susceptible to the influence of character behavior. Empathy is one dispositional trait that may act as a protective factor against sexual risk taking and aggressive behavior. A total of 2,424 adolescents participated in an online study. Measures included exposure to sex, violence, and the combination in movies, adolescent risky sexual behavior, aggressive behavior, the combination behavior, and empathy. Results suggest that exposure to sex and violence in movies is associated with adolescent enactment of similar behaviors for the single behavior and the combination. In addition, empathy plays a role in the relationship between exposure and consequent behavior in adolescents, such that increased empathy had an ameliorating effect on the exposure-behavior relationship, but did not negate it completely. This furthers our understanding of how exposure to specific risk content in media may play a role in adolescent enactment of risky behaviors.\n","Abstract Body: Research has shown that idealized beauty presented in mass media can have detrimental effects on recipients’ body satisfaction. Yet, these idealized images often stem from digital alterations. Hence, countries like France now employ disclaimers that inform viewers about the use of such alterations. Previous research mostly conducted with adult women has pointed out that these disclaimers are ineffective in debunking the perceived realism of the presented images, thus still leading to negative effects on body satisfaction. We examined whether disclaimers might be more effective for a target group, which is not already so used to idealized media images and automatic comparison processes: Tweens and teens. With a two-study design, we firstly developed an adolescents-inspired disclaimer in two co-creation workshops with students (<i>N<\/i> = 47; aged 12-14 years). Secondly, we examined the effectiveness of this newly developed disclaimer in an experimental setting with tweens and teens (<i>N<\/i> = 186; aged 10-19 years). We compared the new disclaimer with the existing disclaimer and a condition presenting no disclaimer. Results point to disclaimers being a rather ineffective way of debunking the perceived realism of media images for tweens and teens, underlining the urgency of developing more effective media literacy measures.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Health and fitness content intended to inspire people to live healthy lives (e.g., “fitspiration”), has been linked to negative body image among girls and young women. Fitness influencers purport wanting to motivate healthy behaviors. We conducted a content analysis (N=449) of a random sample of posts from four Instagram fitness influencers popular on Instagram. Findings shed light on content being conveyed and possible insights into the negative effects associated with viewing such content.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Using data from adolescent social media users between the ages of 14 and 18 (<i>N <\/i>= 225), we examine the associations between active and passive Instagram and Snapchat use on body satisfaction, an indicator of body image during adolescence. Findings indicate differences in the patterns of relations between Instagram and Snapchat use and body satisfaction, as well as the moderating role of self-esteem in these relationships. Using a comparative approach, we discuss findings in light of platform features, different user conceptualizations, and different audiences, in order to theorize and contextualize the differences in the correlates of Instagram and Snapchat use.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Whereas the body of research on sexting and adolescents is substantial, more clarity about the roles of media use and sexual attitudes is needed. Accordingly, this study explored relations between media use, sexual beliefs, and sexting processes in a cross-sectional sample of 5,143 U.S. adolescent girls. Results showed that music video exposure, reality television exposure, and pornography consumption each predicted sexting attitudes, peer norms, intentions, and behaviors. Internalization of sexualization predicted sexting attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, and mediated the relations between each of the media use variables and sexting behaviors. Finally, sexual self-efficacy predicted sexting attitudes and behaviors. The results are discussed in the context of the current conversation about sexualization, sexual agency, and sexting. Theoretical and practical implications are offered and future plans are suggested.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Unhealthy foods advertisements often use motivationally-relevant appeals – i.e., stimuli with survival benefits, linked to hedonic consumption or social eating contexts. These stimuli automatically attract mental resources to the message processing, resulting in memorable advertisements that can influence consumers’ choices and well-being. Aiming to prevent obesity and encourage healthy lifestyles, the current research examines the usability of these appeals to promote healthy foods to young consumers. A mixed factorial experiment recorded memory formation in Preteen Children and Teenagers who watched 24 experimental still media varying in depictions of social eating contexts and of texts emphasizing hedonic consumption versus utilitarian benefits of eating healthy. The direct memory tests (recognition and free recall) revealed that youngsters have better memory for food advertisements featuring social eating contexts. Especially the presence of large groups in pronutritional images was remarkably lasting, contributing to 80% of the health communication messages being recognized and free recalled. As hypothesized, these appeals are more effective for teenagers than for preteen children. This paper discusses the advantages of using motivationally-relevant social appeals to design more memorable media health campaigns, remembered by large numbers of young consumers who might not have models of healthy eating in their day-to-day lives.\n","Abstract Body: Childhood obesity has become a public health epidemic (CDC, 2016). Food advertising (IOM, 2006), and television viewing (Bickham, et al., 2013), have been established as influences in children’s diets. Given the increased prevalence that young audiences view programs online (Rideout, 2016), it is important to assess less traditional media content as well. Using the theoretical framework of social cognitive theory, this study addressed the dietary practices children may learn from YouTube. Four independent coders assessed a random sample of 325 videos uploaded to three leading children’s YouTube channels in the past two years. They determined the type of food referenced, presence of branded food products, context of food consumption and outcomes associated with foods. Findings suggest that, while fruits and vegetables are referenced substantially more often than in traditional food advertising, the majority of foods referenced on YouTube are typically unhealthy products. They are presented in the context of a game or toy and associated with positive outcomes. While many reference branded products, and branded products are particularly likely to be of poorer nutritional quality, none of the videos presented a disclosure of paid content. Thus, it appears that child YouTube stars are voluntarily promoting an unhealthy diet to viewers.\n","Abstract Body: Obesity is a serious concern for American adolescents (Hales, Carroll, Frayar & Ogden, 2017). These youth often lack health-consciousness (Dong, 2015), making it difficult to properly evaluate food advertising (Choi et al., 2012). Using the framework of the elaboration likelihood model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986), this quasi-experimental study investigated the role of health-consciousness as a motivator to assess the healthfulness of a food and ultimately find it more desirable. Alternatively, we assessed whether lower health-conscious youth would assess the appearance of characters in advertising differently and use this peripheral cue to evaluate a product. Our data largely confirmed that health-consciousness encourages consumption of a nutritious product and that those adolescents lower in health consciousness, and higher in BMI, can be encouraged to like a healthy food if the associated character is thin. Findings suggest that, while the body positivity movement is making advances in limiting bias against those who are overweight by encouraging the portrayal of heavier models (McKelle, 2015), these efforts could be detrimental to the audience most in need of effective promotions for healthy foods.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Research suggests that strong persuasive strategies are necessary to influence children’s healthy nutritional behavior. This study investigates whether the source, who is providing nutritional information, matters for persuasion. We conducted an experimental study with children between 6 and 11 years (<i>N<\/i> = 342) who watched an audiovisual cartoon with nutritional messages containing arguments about eating fruit either provided by experts (i.e., expert condition), celebrities (i.e., celebrity condition), or typical consumers (i.e., peer condition). Additionally, we included a control group in which children were not exposed to any cartoon. As the dependent variable, we measured healthy fruit consumption and based on the elaboration likelihood model we inserted either argument awareness or source credibility as possible mediators. The results indicate that the experimental conditions were equally effective to create argument awareness for healthy eating behavior compared to the control group. However, argument awareness did not influence children’s healthy fruit consumption. Moreover, we found no differences in children’s evaluation of source credibility. Yet there was a direct effect of the expert condition on children’s fruit consumption, pointing to an internalized “expert heuristic”. Thus, our study suggests that using experts to present nutritional information within narrative media content is a potentially successful strategy to create awareness for healthy food and to impact children’s healthy food consumption. Implications are discussed.<br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> fruit consumption; nutritional messages; children; social endorsers; argument awareness; credibility\n","Abstract Body: Nutritional knowledge is an important cognitive barrier that potentially helps children to follow a healthy diet. Two main information agents influence children’s development of nutritional knowledge: the media and their parents. While a high amount of media consumption potentially decreases children’s nutritional knowledge, parents may shape the amount of information children can gather about nutrition through their food-related mediation styles. In addition, children’s individual preconditions predict how children can process the provided nutritional information. This two-wave-panel study with children (<i>N<\/i>= 719; 5-11 years) and their parents (<i>N<\/i>= 719) investigated the main effects and interplay of children’s amount of media consumption and their parent’s food-related mediation styles. Children’s individual preconditions were also considered. The results showed that media consumption has a negative effect on children’s nutritional knowledge over time. Parents’ restrictive or active food-related mediation asserted no main effects and could not lever out the negative effects of the amount of media consumption. Therefore, we argue that parents should limit children’s amount of media consumption to avoid the manifestation of misperceptions about nutrition.<br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>nutritional knowledge; media; children; parental food-related mediation styles; individual preconditions\n","Abstract Body: Qualitative research has enriched understandings of the practice of exchanging personal sexualized images among young people and helped readdress an overemphasis on the risks of sexting in mainstream discourses and quantitative research. Nevertheless, there has been little concerted effort to systematically build cumulative empirical knowledge of sexting based on qualitative studies. In this study, we sought to synthesize previous qualitative empirical studies on youth sexting using meta-ethnography. To inform the ongoing public discourses concerning youth online privacy, we drew upon the communication privacy management theory. The findings illustrate young people’s (a) development and attributes of privacy rules, (b) personal and collective coordination of boundaries, and (c) latent boundary turbulence of youth sexting practice.\n","Abstract Body: The easiness of smartphone portability and the multitude of personalised Internet-based<br />applications facilitate the development of smartphone dependency, also termed “problematic<br />smartphone use”. However, there is still dissent in terms of conceptualising and measuring<br />smartphone addiction. Researchers have started to investigate the frequency and duration of<br />device use in relation to PSU by incorporating objective trace data, however a comprehensive<br />picture still lacks for adolescent population. The study aimed to understand better if and how<br />passively recorded and self-reported smartphone usage data were correlated, and which usage<br />indicators, e.g., duration, frequency of checking, and time distortion of smartphone screen use,<br />better predicts levels of PSU both cross-sectionally and longitudinally one year later. Results<br />from a sample of 84 adolescents, showed that adolescents tend to report a rather reliable<br />estimate of their time spent with the smartphone per day. In addition, checking behaviours and<br />time distortion, but no screen time duration, predicted problematic smartphone use at both<br />Time 1 and Time 2. Methodologies and theoretical implications of problematic smartphone use<br />assessment are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Research about the media use of children is often concerned with negative (or positive) effects of one particular media. There is rather little research about particular media diets in terms of their diversity and the resulting outcomes. Drawing on a representative sample of 448 children between 6 and 12, we therefore develop a typology of media users based on their media diet, referring to a media repertoires approach. Data reveals three clusters of children with different patterns of media use, which could be named as screen users, who dominantly use screen media, versatiles who show a broad variety of use, and selectives with a rather narrow repertoire.<br />Contrary to often expressed concerns, versatiles engage more frequently in non-media activities compared to the other groups. Furthermore, we did not find significant differences between the user types with regard to reported negative experiences as a result of internet use. Results show that it is not only important to concentrate on how often children use a particular media, instead, parents and educators should also spend attention to children’s media menus, since simply inferring from frequent media use on negative effects might fall too short.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This article is part of the outcomes of the Transmedia Literacy research project (European Commission-Horizon 2020) on teens and transmedia collaborative practices carried out in eight countries between 2015 and 2018. A multi-method approach was used in the study (questionnaires, workshops, media diaries, interviews, observation of online communities) to explore what teens are doing with media. This article presents a map of the uses, practices and metaphors teens make of YouTube. Five YouTube uses were detected: radiophonic, televisual, social, productive and educative. These uses vary according to the practices performed by teens and how they are related to the logics of the YouTube platform. The identified metaphors show the ways teens’ uses are related to their everyday routines and the way they integrate the YouTube into various dimensions of their social life, such as their media practices, and the way they acquire knowledge and skills.\n","Abstract Body: Like other countries throughout the Anglophone West, the problem of cyberbullying has become something of a national obsession—even a media panic—in Australia. The mass media has framed the issue as a crisis and an epidemic threatening the wellbeing of Australian youth, provoking a comprehensive policy and legislative response to the problem. This paper draws on qualitative interviews and focus groups with forty Australian parents to determine parents’ own anxieties, perspectives, and experiences in relation to cyberbullying. This study found that while online conflict, exclusion and relational aggression appear common amongst young people, participants eschewed the term cyberbullying and were resistant to what they considered to be overly sensationalized media coverage of the issue. Parents in this study, while noting that cyberbullying differed from non-mediated, offline bullying in some ways, suggested that cyberbullying was not a new, urgent problem, but instead, an extension of an issue that young people had been navigating for decades. Thus, parents considered it to be part of ‘normal’ child development. This paper concludes by arguing that a more nuanced understanding of negative online behaviours is needed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Messaging apps like WhatsApp are tremendously popular among young adolescents (Anderson & Jiang, 2018). These applications are often pinpointed as enablers or “causers” of cyber aggression: Behaviors enacted via computer-mediated communication (CMC) that are perceived as derogatory, offensive or harmful, such as nonconsensual image sharing, hurtful comments, and social exclusion (Cohen-Almagor, 2018; Hinduja & Patchin, 2016). This study examined the effects of group centrality and out-group accountability on conformity to cyber aggression in a messaging app experiment. Early adolescents (<i>N <\/i>= 263, <i>M <\/i>= 13.2, <i>SD <\/i>= 0.9) responded to cyber aggression scenarios in an interaction with e-confederates. Results from a factorial analysis of variance showed no significant direct effects of group centrality and out-group accountability on conformity to cyber aggression. However, a PROCESS mediation model revealed a significant indirect effect of group centrality on conformity to cyber aggression, mediated by social identification: Group centrality increased social identification, which, in turn, increased conformity to cyber aggression. Results point to the strength of accountability perceptions and social identification in increasing conformity effects among early adolescents in messaging apps.\n","Abstract Body: The experience of boredom for adolescents has shifted significantly as new technologies, such as social media, function as easy escape routes. This study investigates boredom as a predictor of social media use in Chinese adolescents. More specifically, the moderating role of offline relationship quality with classmates, teachers, and parents between boredom proneness and frequency of social media use is explored. Three hundred and forty-three 12-17 year old Chinese students completed associated measures. Latent moderated structural equation modelling was conducted, and results showed that boredom proneness was significantly associated with more time spent on social media. Furthermore, this impact was moderated by certain negative offline relationship quality variables. Bored adolescents who have higher levels of negative offline relationships, specifically with classmates and teachers, were found to spend more time on social media. Non-significant moderation results were found for negative offline interactions with parents and positive offline interactions with parents, classmates, and teachers. Implications of the results for the intolerance of boredom and maladaptive coping strategies in a world where social media is ubiquitous are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This cross-sectional study among adolescents aimed to examine how exposure to social cues on social media and self-posting of social cues on social media related to popularity pressure and subsequently social life satisfaction. The results showed no significant links with exposure to social cues, but did show positive relations between self-posting of social cues, popularity pressure and social life satisfaction. The findings underline the importance of further research on self-effects on social media.\n","Abstract Body: Children’s and adolescents’ experiences with relocation can affect their close social relationships, especially when family members and friends are not living in the immediate proximity anymore. Although face-to-face communication might be limited in the course of spatial mobility, computer-mediated communication can help to maintain and develop existing or even initiate new social relationships. In the present study, we exploratory investigated the role of children’s and adolescents’ communication behavior with friends for their perceived friendship quality after experiencing relocation. Out of a representative survey study of families in Germany, we selected parents who have moved with their child (8 to 14 years) to another village/town within the last 24 months. In total, 57 parents (mostly mothers) allowed their child to participate in the phone interview. The children answered questions regarding their three best friends. Using multilevel analysis, we found that computer-mediated communication can absorb limitations in existing friendships after relocation.\n","Abstract Body: While social media influencers are gleaning increasing trust and investment from brands, advertisers, and followers, insights on the role of influencers in adolescents’ relationship formation and consumption behaviors are still rare. Drawing on the literatures of influencer content value, influencer credibility, parental mediation, and parasocial relationship, this study proposed a conceptual model that expounds the appeal of influencers among adolescents. To test the model, we administered an online survey – recruited in proportion to demographic quotas (i.e., age, gender and ethnicity) –among 500 U.S. adolescents (aged 10- to 19-years old) via Qualtrics panel. Results revealed that, the entertainment value of influencer-generated content, influencer expertise, trustworthiness, attractiveness, and followers’ perceived similarity to their favorite influencers, are positively related to the perceived parasocial relationship between adolescent followers and their favorite influencers, which in turn, are associated with adolescents’ materialistic views and purchase intentions. We also explored the role of parental mediation of adolescents’ social media use in their parasocial relationship with influencers. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Early conversations are an important source in shaping children’s cognitive and emotional development and it is important to understand how parents use media as a platform to engage in conversations with their young children, and what might predict the quality of these interactions. Thus, in the current study we explored the nature of parent-child discourse while engaging in media (i.e., joint media engagement) with infants, and how parent (empathic concern and responsiveness) and child (negative emotionality and regulatory capacity) variables might be associated with the quality of engagement. The current study consisted of 269 infants (50% female, <i>M<sub>age <\/sub><\/i>= 17.09 months, <i>SD <\/i>= 3.93; 59% White) and their primary caregiver (98% mothers) who engaged in a variety of in-home tasks and maternal questionnaires. Results established three meaningful codes for both mother and child that assessed positive and negative (distraction, correction) joint media engagement. Further, results suggested that maternal empathic concern was associated with positive mother and child media engagement; while child negative emotionality was associated with lower levels of distraction. Discussion focuses on the importance of studying parent-child discourse in the context of joint media engagement and recommends limiting media exposure before 18 months of age.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores parents-children communication about children’s Internet use, including parents’ perceived significance of these conversations, and whether their demographic variables predict their preferred mediation strategies. The goal is to gauge the level of awareness and strategic employment of verbal communication occurring between parents and children regarding their Internet practices, and thus understand how to further assist parents in developing a more effective and open communication style with their children in their daily life.\n","Abstract Body: In our digital society, children are being born in media-filled homes, and starting to use them very early. Their favorites are mobile devices: they usually start by experimenting with the parents’ smartphones, and several children under 8 years old have their own tablets. Parents are facing the challenge of mediating digital media very early on for the first time, and have mixed perceptions and attitudes towards the opportunities and risks of digital technologies. Sonia Livingstone has been working on the notion of “positive online content” for the last decade, supported by other stakeholders such as the POSCON network, aiming to identify and disseminate guidelines and criteria for producing and selecting positive digital content for young children. Our research applies and adapts these guidelines and criteria to mobile media, highlighting the protection of children’s rights (such as privacy), their engagement and participation, and the development of diversified competences. In our empirical work, we set out to identify the criteria used by parents of young children for selecting apps for them, exploring the features that they value the most. As a context, we also explored the parents’ account of their children’s digital practices and of their parental mediation. We conducted an online survey in Portugal to parents of children under 8 years old, and obtained a total of 1968 valid answers. Our findings reveal that parents tend to perceive mobile media having their offline experiences as reference: they identify educational with school and traditional formats such as puzzles and building games, overlooking the pedagogical potential of the favorite formats of children, such as simulators. Also, parents do not value technical features such as user experience and interface, or the active participation of children. They are, nonetheless, aware about the possibilities of privacy invasion and commercial exploitation.\n","Abstract Body: Smartphone use has become nearly ubiquitous in children’s and adolescents’ daily life. As a consequence, many parents express resignation or frustration at a perceived loss of control over their child’s excessive smartphone activities. Yet, this perceived lack of control may result in harmful consequences for children such as being more frequently exposed to online harassment or feeling less supported by their parents. These processes may negatively affect children’s self-esteem, which is particularly vulnerable during the transition from childhood to adolescence. We tested these relationships using a two-wave panel study of children between 10 and 14 years (<i>N<\/i><sub>T2<\/sub>= 384) and one of their parents. Findings revealed that parental lack of control over their child’s smartphone use increased the risk of children becoming victim of online harassment over time. Additionally, parental lack of control was associated with lower perceived parental support among children, which decreased their self-esteem in the long term.\n","Abstract Body: In recent years, there has been an increase in television programming that aims to provide realistic portrayals of adolescent and young adult life. While a number of studies have examined the impact this programming may have on adolescent outcomes and experiences, research has not considered how parents might be able to learn from these shows. Specifically, research has failed to consider the relationship between adolescent-directed programming and parent knowledge about their adolescent child’s life, as well as the relations that parent viewership and knowledge may have on perceived parental efficacy. Research suggests that parent knowledge about their child’s life and parent efficacy are related concepts and that efficaciousness is built upon a perceived awareness of a child’s environment. We test these relationships using data from 1,285 parent viewers and non-viewers of the series <i>13 Reasons Why<\/i>. Viewers were sampled from four global regions: Brazil, Australia/New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Results suggest that parent knowledge of their adolescent’s life is positively related to parent efficacy, and that there is an indirect, positive relationship between parent viewership and parent efficacy, mediated by parent knowledge. Region did not moderate these relationships. We discuss these findings in the context of adolescent individuation and how adolescent-directed media may be able to help parents as their adolescent children grow in autonomy.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: parent knowledge; parent efficacy; <i>13 Reasons Why<\/i>, individuation, parent-adolescent communication\n","Abstract Body: Many science TV shows for children feature refutation narratives, wherein characters discuss misconceptions before learning factual information. Previous research suggests that children misunderstand these stories, and the current study examined if learning could be improved using interventions previously validated with adults. Children (<i>N<\/i> = 201) aged 4 to 7 viewed one of three versions of a refutation narrative or a modified episode that did not mention misconceptions. Although children’s comprehension of factual information was high across all conditions, their understanding of misconceptions depended on their prior knowledge. Specifically, children with low prior knowledge were confused by the original story and performed worse on a subsequent transfer task compared to children who viewed the show without misconceptions. Conversely, children with high prior knowledge understood the original story best. Consequently, the inclusion of misconceptions in science programming appears to disrupt learning for some children and bolster learning for others.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Parents comprise a large portion of the audience for children’s educational television, yet few studies have investigated how exposure to this material influences them. In the current experiment, mother-child dyads (<i>N<\/i> = 46) watched one of two versions of a science television show that emphasized different approaches to early science learning. Although children struggled to learn from the show, mothers benefitted in many ways. Specifically, one version of the show taught them new factual information, whereas the other version enhanced their belief that science inquiry skills are important for their children to learn, as well as their confidence that they could teach those skills to their children. Despite these improvements, neither show changed the way mothers interacted with their children during a subsequent science activity. However, many mothers reported in a follow-up survey that the show impacted their child in a variety of idiosyncratic ways over the next two weeks.\n","Abstract Body: Educational TV for preschoolers often features unrealistic (animated and/or anthropomorphic) characters, and it is unclear how children perceive these characters as sources of information. Ninety-two 3- to 5-year-olds were shown paired images of characters and asked to choose which would be best for learning about eight topics (three domains: animal physiology, human physiology, socioemotional). Children were randomized to choose between eight paired images of: (1) live-action humans vs. animated humans (i.e., holding character type constant, varying format), or (2) animated humans vs. animated anthropomorphic animals (i.e., holding format constant, varying character type), or (3) live-action humans vs. animated anthropomorphic animals (i.e., most realistic vs. least realistic). Children chose animated characters as best for learning for all three domains. They distinguished less between humans and animals. These patterns held irrespective of the child’s age or measures of familiarity with animated and anthropomorphic characters.\n","Abstract Body: In an effort to distinguish and systematically categorize the lessons emphasized by children’s educational media, we applied a coding scheme based on the model of intuitive motivation and exemplars to a sample of <i>N<\/i> = 72 popular educational and prosocial television shows recommended by CommonSenseMedia.org. Results revealed a preponderance of the egoistic motivation of competence (overall and in educational shows), and the altruistic motivation of care (in prosocial shows). Practical implications for parents are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Mobile devices represent a particularly exciting platform with great ubiquity and promise in young children’s lives. However, one challenge in using these devices is that parents and teachers are increasingly wary of screen time and question the developmental benefit of using these devices for teaching specific content. The emerging technological feature of haptic (or tactile) feedback touch-screen displays might reduce this barrier. In order to better understand parents’ attitudes toward technology and haptic features, in particular, we conducted an online survey with more than 1000 parents. Ideally, if we can identify parents’ attitudes, we can curate classroom and other out-of-home environments with this technology that are in line with parent values to further support young children’s learning.\n","Abstract Body: The purpose of this study was to examine how often sexual consent was portrayed in teenage-based Netflix shows and to what extent there were differences in sexual consent communication among teenage characters based on gender and sexual orientation. This study content analyzed sexual scenes from a total of 16 U.S. Netflix original shows which premiered between January 2017 and October 2019 which resulted in a sample of approximately 200 hours of television content. Preliminary findings indicate sexual consent was reserved for characters who were sexually inexperienced, whereas characters who were sexually experienced did not feel obligated to seek consent. Overall, there was a lack of affirmative sexual consent sought between characters regardless of the characters’ sexual orientation, and male characters were the least likely to obtain consent. Furthermore, sexual violence and risky sexual behavior was portrayed without consequences, and refusal to continue sexual activity was met with hostility and further attempts at coercion. The implications of these findings are that impressionable teenage viewers to whom these shows are targeted may replicate these problematic behaviors and follow similar sexual scripts.\n","Abstract Body: Extended Abstract Submission (See attached)<br />CONSIDER FOR RESEARCH ESCALATOR SESSION<br /><i>Note: seeking mentorship from scholars with sexting research expertise (e.g. Joris Van Ouytsel)<\/i>\n","Abstract Body: <br />Discussions and studies on children's social behavior as competent television viewers today is worldwide. Television has considerable influence on today’s children and adolescents. Television's impact on viewer attitudes and behaviors has been the subject of a great deal of research since television was introduced to our homes in the late 1940s (Haper-Gilmore, 1994).<br />In Kenya, the development of the mass media during the last decade has been very rapid. Young children are especially vulnerable since they are less able to discriminate reality from fiction. The question that continues in discussions is whether or not children should be protected from media influence. Among other media that may have influence on children, it is presumed that television has more direct and stronger influence towards children. Many Nairobi households have television sets as a sign of urban lifestyle. Television has replaced the so busy parents who have not time to socialize with their young children and has become children’s closest friend at home.<br />Globally, viewing of television occupies a large proportion of children’s time. Almost one in five children spend more than 35 hours of watching the television each week (Gentile & Walsh, 2002). Anderson, Field, Collins, Lorch and Nathan (1985) suggested that staring from pre-school, children spend more time watching television than participating in any other activity except sleeping. Huston, 1989 argue that children also have extensive experience with television before they are exposed to many socializing agents, such as schools, peers, and religious institutions. Given the central function of television as a medium of socialization in most children's lives, it is important to understand its potential effects on a variety of cognitive, academic, social, behavioral, and attitudinal outcomes of the viewers, particularly school going children.<br />The study hopes to inform parents, policymakers and educators who work with children about the influence of media, particularly television, on primary school children’s social behaviour in order to make informed decisions.<br />The purpose of this study will be examine how television programs influences children social behaviour among primary school children in PCEA Bahati Church, Nairobi County.<br />Objectives of the Study:<br />To find out the type of programs that primary school children watch and their effects on children social-development<br />To establish the duration primary school children spend watching the television programs and its effect on their social development.<br />To assess the kind of social interaction associated with TV viewing among primary school children<br />The researcher will use descriptive methodology for this study in order to gather data directly.<br /><br /><br />REFERENCES<br />Anderson, D.

Although restrictive mediation more frequently occurred, three primary mediation strategies (active, restrictive, and co-viewing) were employed concurrently for both television commercials and sponsored YouTube content. The study also suggests incorporating parents’ techniques dealing with child’s pestering in parental advertising mediation. Practical implications for scholars and educators are discussed.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Cyberbullying and online harassment among young people pose a significant problem for social media companies where these incidents often take place (Milosevic, 2016; Gillespie, 2018). Social media companies have developed a variety of tools to address this issue in a reactive manner. These include various reporting or blocking tools which allow the victim to either stop the person who is committing the abuse from contacting them further; or, to report the incident to the social media company so that the platform can assess whether there has been a violation of the company’s Terms of Service or company’s rules and to decide if the content should be taken down and the abusive account suspended (Milosevic, 2018). Companies have even developed the so-called Safety or Help Centers which provide prevention materials and educational resources for children, caregivers and teachers with information on what to do when bullying happens on their platforms. Nonetheless, these interventions have had limited effectiveness, not least because of the vastness of content shared on these platforms, which is difficult to moderate by human labor (Staksrud & Lobe, 2010; Donoso, 2011; Van Royen et al., 2015, 2016; Milosevic & Vladisavljevic, forthcoming). When a piece of content is reported, it would typically need to be reviewed by humans who work for companies, the so-called moderators, who evaluate whether the content that has been reported breaches the companies’ terms. This process can take a long time, and the companies may not be able to review and take down all bullying content. Or the very content takedown may not solve the bullying problem which can continue on other platforms or offline.<br />In an effort to expedite the review and content moderation process, social media companies have been developing various machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools whereby sophisticated algorithms help label the content as potentially cyberbullying (Auli et al., 2019). Such content can then be further examined by companies’ moderators. Facebook’s Transparency Report, for example, states that of all the cyberbullying cases, their tools managed to at one point identify 21% of the cases before users had actually reported them.[1] Companies tend to provide little information about how these proactive AI-based systems work. While researchers who work for companies and develop these tools presumably have access to large amounts of user data, including data from children and adolescents, this access is not available to researchers who do not work for the companies.<br />This article addresses the issue of access and ethical handling of children’s data, when the purpose of such access is to create tools meant to help companies address cyberbullying. The author of the article has received competitive funding from Facebook and Instagram in order to port an existing machine learning tool onto their platforms with the purpose of training the tool to address platform-specific bullying incidents among children. Following the development of such tool, focus groups and in-depth interviews with children who have experienced cyberbullying will be organized in order to establish whether such a tool is actually effective from children’s perspective, why this might be the case, and how it can be improved. It is an effort to co-design an AI-based tool with children. At the same time, we are interested in how children perceive their privacy or any other concerns they might have related to the deployment of such a tool on these platforms. Does it go without saying that such AI-based tools should only be employed on the content that is shared publicly? If children should welcome such an AI-based intervention, how should it look like? The author will ensure that the sampling includes children from disadvantaged backgrounds or where minority language is spoken at home, as these tools may be less effective in languages other than English.<br />Given that this project is only now in its beginning stages, the article will detail the preliminary results of the qualitative research with children. It will also examine the ethical implications of working with companies in order to obtain access to data which might be necessary to train the tool; as well as the development of best practices in terms of company collaboration and the effort towards ensuring greater openness and transparency on behalf of the companies and their sharing of information with independent researchers.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Auli, M., et al.

Media are either alarmist, (like the ‘Blue Whale Challenge’ and ‘Momo Challenge’) quoting social media as probable reasons behind youth suicides and other problems or drawing up endless lists of tips on how parents could help manage and moderate their children’s social media use, with children largely seen as a vulnerable group in need of protection. Research in this field is still in the early stages, particularly in the context of emerging economies and their transitional cultures. We find broad-based quantitative industry research (ASSOCHAM, 2015; PTI, 2014) spelling out increased access and underage use which further fuels technopanics but barely any in-depth studies that actually look at how young people experience social media or how parents are approaching parenting in this “permanently online, permanently connected” (Vorderer, et al. (Eds.), 2017) world. My doctoral thesis focuses on centring the children’s experiences and bringing their insights to building knowledge (Livingstone & Third, 2017) regarding their access, uses, perceptions and practices on social media. This will help guide a rights-based approach to their practices online akin to the one advocated for by Livingstone and Third. However, during my preliminary fieldwork, it felt like this, though very important, was only part of the puzzle. What we really need, to realise the vision of children and parents directing their narrative and guiding the rights-based approach, is for them to not just be participants in any study, but to be collaborators and co-authors. Can we design open research to be truly inclusive? Can we have them co-opt and insert themselves into the process of delivering and theorising their narratives? Can we let them alter the process even and break it apart and build on it? Is it possible to bring our knowledge of research and theory to weave into their lives such that we theorise together as co-researchers and/ or co-writers? By inviting volunteer pairs of children and parents to go on this journey with me, this is an attempt to answering such questions in the hope that research and academic writing become more open and I feel less like someone who has hijacked my participants’ lived experiences and turned them into theory that is distanced from them and their lives.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The goal of the present study is to understand how preadolescents’ perceptions of their parents’ mobile device distraction (‘technoference’) are related to their satisfaction with family life. Specifically, a model is put forward that proposes this association to be mediated by parent-child conflict, companionship and perceived emotional support. Data from a cross-sectional survey (<i>n<\/i> = 579, 50.1% girls, <i>M<\/i><i>age<\/i>= 10.85, <i>SD <\/i>= 0.72) supported the associations specified in our model. First, our findings demonstrate that preadolescents who perceived higher amounts of parent technoference also rated the relationship with their parents significantly lower in terms of support and companionship. Moreover, parent mobile device distraction was significantly associated with more conflict. Indirect effects were found for all mediators, thus revealing three pathways through which technoference is related to preadolescents’ assessments of family satisfaction.\n",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"Abstracts: The online data practices in digital activism provide opportunities and drawbacks for how users develop the identity, relationships, and protection. Data activism shows the complex environment of group actions and individual engagement that takes a critical standpoint between big data and enormous data collection (Milan, 2017). The use of data activism can have significant results for connecting people, reaching new groups, and mobilizing . Although embracing these data practices can bring to problematic conditions of how to protect the activists and members of profiling, microtargeting, and privacy. Therefore, there is a need for an empirical understanding of what data practices exist and how to express the data. This paper discusses findings of in-depth interviews and observations with Indonesian activists from the Save KPK movement (an anti-corruption movement), the ForBALI movement (environmental movement), and the 2019 Indonesian Presidential Election Campaign (pro-Jokowi movement).\n","Abstracts: <br />This paper offers a case study of g0v, a Taiwanese civic hacking community. Situating this case in current debates about digital civic participation, I look at the conceptions, infrastructures, and performances of open source civic hacking in g0v, dubbed “open collaboration” by its participants. Using in-depth interviews and online archival-ethnographic research methods, I find that, akin to Kelty’s (2008) notion of “recursive publics”, g0v participants conceive their work as iterative modifications of data structures that pave the way for future interventions. Their emphasis on openness and the recursivity of their work are evident in their constant effort to refine online infrastructures of the community. Such conceptions and infrastructural support are manifest in the case studies of its projects that follow in this paper. Finally, the paper discusses the potential pathways through which open collaboration may lead to social and political changes on the institutional level.\n","Abstracts: Through an ethnographic research of civic tech groups in South Korea, this research shows how civic tech has evolved in a non-Western society whose culture of citizenship is distinctive to the Western liberal democracy. Civic tech in Korea, though it arose in the influence of open government and civic hacking movement in Western countries, was defined by a politics of opposition against the authoritative regime and the socio-economic inequalities in the 2010s. In the candlelight protests and the impeachment in 2017, civic tech has become a contested site of citizenship formation where nation-based, civil society-oriented, or personally-devised perceptions of civic identity intersect with one another. Presenting how civic tech participants constitute themselves as digital citizens through their activities of ‘political’ civic tech, transforming or embracing traditional citizen norms in Korea, I examine how digital and data practices mediate the digital citizenship formation in the historical and political context of Korea.\n","Abstracts: This paper explores how an environmental non-governmental organization, Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE) activists’ practices around a civic tech initiative are growing to become data activism in China, expanding the space for environmental participation. By conducting interviews and participatory observations, accompanied with document analysis, we describe three modes of data activism which present different participatory mechanisms for publics to oversee empowered agents to make environmental changes. Moving beyond the counter-hegemonic imaginaries of datafication in the Western notion of data activism, we argue that the social-technical imaginaries underlying IPE activists’ data practices are localized in the specific sociopolitical context of China. They do not involve contentious political criticism against the existing environmental governance system although they have the functions of counter-democracy. Instead, they are issue-specific, working as a “constructive alternative” (Coleman,2017, p.22) to radical denial of the governance system, aiming to make decision-making more democratic within the existing norms.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This paper argues for the multiple communicative erasures embedded in the labour practices of migrant domestic work. The parallel experiences of South Asian domestic workers laboring in Noida (India) and Singapore as experiences of (im)mobilities and expulsions are discussed amid the construction and importation of the “The Singapore Model” across multiple Asian cities. In the paper, we specifically hear the voices of domestic workers in Noida as scripts of the global margins that exist within the centers coined as neoliberal meccas or cities that emulate them. These storied realities of performing reproductive labor disrupt the celebration of neoliberal development in cities described as model cities for work and play. Domestic work continues to function in precarity with multiple junctures of (im)mobilities embedded in the structural conditions of domestic labor. The unpacking of the erasures seeks to reveal the (im)mobilities of low-skilled labor movements from the Global South to Asian centres of growth and development.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper looks into the following question: to what extent does Kuaishou, a grassroots-based app, empowers disadvantaged groups? This paper conducts a qualitative research on the media representation of wage arrears on Kuaishou, and finds that the videos fall into five frames, two of which enjoy dominant exposure. This study further finds that the two most popular frames –– the “suffering” frame and the “pseudo-success” frame –– are not an ideal empowerment for migrant workers in the long run.\n","Abstracts: <br /><br />Community radio is one of the few media platforms that support prisoners’ radio. While, more recently, podcasting and online broadcasting have also been adopted by the genre, community radio has long provided an avenue for the voices of prisoners and their advocates, in numerous countries including Mexico, Australia, the United States and Canada (the latter being the focus of this paper). Previous research by the author has defined prisoners’ radio as a media that works with prisoners, former prisoners, their family, friends and support networks to maintain personal connections and to broadcast alternative discourses on criminal justice issues. However, there has been little research that interrogates exactly how prisoners’ radio pushes back against a dominant punitive media discourse. This paper addresses this gap by applying critical discourse analysis to broadcasts from a long-running prison radio program on campus radio in Montreal, Canada to identify the ways in which prisoners’ radio creates alternative representations of prisoners and their communities.<br /><br />Bio<br />Dr Heather Anderson is a Senior Lecturer with the School of Humanities, Languages and Social Science at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.

From policy to the grassroots, community radio has been known to facilitate conversation and cooperation between different groups, provide a platform for issues that are silenced by mainstream media, and provide a voice for those who find themselves without one. While the topic of “community” has understandably been the subject of much debate within community and alternative media literature, what is missing from these discussions is the role of the individual within this environment. This paper explores the role of the individual as an everyday activist within community radio. Drawing on qualitative research conducted at two community radio stations in South India, this paper argues that, within a supportive, facilitative environment like community radio, all it may take is a single voice to inspire and enact change.<br />\n",null,"Abstracts: Australia has a 40+ year history of publicly-funded, volunteer-run community radio that serves as a benchmark for developments around the world. Despite chronic funding pressures, the sector is a platform for diverse and dissenting voices, including an extensive network of First Nations media, ethnic community media, radical radio, women of colour collectives, media by and for people with disability, prisoners’ radio, alternative journalism and much more. Established as an intervention for social justice in the 1970s, community radio in Australia, as around the world, now faces multiple ‘disruptions’. In this paper we draw on interviews, public statements and a mapping of diverse voices in order to explore key challenges for community radio in the digital age. We focus on news and current affairs – including news journalisms and issues-based talks programming – at a time of both technological and professional ‘disruption’. And we ask, what is the role and value of established ‘community’ media when social media platforms enable a proliferation of voice?<br /><br />Bios<br />Dr Tanja Dreher is an ARC Future Fellow, Scientia Fellow and Associate Professor in Media at the University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia.

The VFG was specifically developed to support engaged research about how activists conceptualize the political role of technology in their struggles for social change by stimulating participants to reflect on their unspoken assumptions about digital technologies. After reviewing the relevant literature on focus groups and graphic elicitation techniques, the paper presents two types of VFGs: diagnostic and prescriptive. While diagnostic VFGs are primarily a research tool meant to enable researchers to assess how people envision technology, prescriptive VFGs encourage participants to imagine better digital technologies. I describe the structure of both types of VFGs and offer examples of their outputs; I then discuss the limitations of this method and propose other research topics for which it might be used.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the experiences of 13 Latina sixth grade students in Los Angeles who participated in a yearlong journalism-based media literacy program embedded in their social studies classes. Students had opportunities to research, interview, write and publish articles to the web about social justice themes, including immigration, feminism, racism, gun violence, and LGBTQ rights. Students also interrogated pervasive negative narratives about their community and culture. Grounded in critical pedagogy, American pragmatism, and social justice education, focus group findings showed students fostered critical awareness about social justice issues and developed agency to become vocal and take action through advocacy and authentic application of lessons and skills. The journalistic approach and student perspectives reported illustrate new ways for educators to engage students in critical thinking, literacy, and social justice work in middle school.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores patterns among anti-Olympics art over time and space in order to examine the role of the visual in contesting power in the context of sports mega-events. I argue that anti-Olympic graphics disrupt the International Olympic Committee’s narratives and threaten its claims to authority. By rejecting top-down visuality, the graphics also imagine and enact new alternative possibilities in which a city’s residents have more local power relative to global networks of capital.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Though qualitative communication research by disabled researchers provide considerable insights into academic activists of various backgrounds, this context is still understudied. The current paper presents a Hard of Hearing researcher's struggle between the commitment to her D/deaf research participants and the unintentional academic expectation to work according to able-bodied research standards. By rethinking the methodological, communicative, and cultural aspects of the 'subaltern-researcher' concept, this paper aims to promote wider understanding of academic diversity.\n","Abstract Body: Over the past decades, studies about trust transition have always been  an important  topic. We assume that most transitions of trust should present certain rules and trends: under the context of little influence of external or internal forces and their changes, the factors affecting trust in a certain society will reach a relatively stable and self-balancing state, namely, trust equilibrium; under the significant influences of external or internal forces, the equilibrium of trust would be broken and the inflection point of trust would emerge, slowly moving towards a new equilibrium of trust, namely, trust reconstruction. Using the data statistics and event analysis, this article finds that the political, economic and social changes in the past seventy years have resulted in profound trust transitions in China, basically reflecting the historical trajectory that the activities of trust tend to a certain trust equilibrium, and then the inflection point of trust, and finally trust reconstruction, and confirming the theoretical assumption of trust transitions. That is, we here study the function mechanism of trust equilibrium, the reasons for the formation of trust inflection point and the sustaining conditions of trust reconstruction. This paper is beneficial for further understanding the trust order and trust transitions.\n","Abstract Body: The following study is conducted about the relationship between youth perception of social movements and their attitude and behavior in May 2018 elections in Lebanon. The aim of the study is to evaluate the exposure to social movements via social and mass media and the attitudes towards current politicians and asses its relation with voting decisions. Research questions of the study included (1) Exposure to Social Movements and Perceptions about Civil Movements and (2) Social Movements Impact on Voting. In order to conduct the study, a quantitative design was applied via questionnaires. This survey design served in assessing the perception, attitude, future behavior of Lebanese Youth, and allowed objective and numerical analysis. The sample of the study was 203 respondents gathered all over Lebanon to best describe different perspectives formed by the Lebanese Youth participants. The findings revealed that Youth are quite exposed to social movements via both mass and social media. Majority of them tend not to vote, but the ones who want to vote are willing to vote to new politicians, noting that the youth believe that social movements represent them and are better for the welfare of the nation.<br /><br />Keywords: Civic Engagement, Social Movements, Social Media, Mediated Activism, Politics, Voting, Lebanon<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Social movements have been theorized as contentious collective actions initiated by the civil society. Indeed, institutional activists who occupy positions within the administration can employ institutional means (e.g., launching strikes, influencing policies) to support a social movement. We examine how social-psychological factors and communication influence institutional activists’ participation, based on a survey of civil servants in Hong Kong (N = 277). The results show that both the perceived damage to reputation and collective efficacy relate positively to participation intent. Moreover, traditional media news use has an indirect effect on participation intent through perceived damage to reputation, and interpersonal discussions have indirect effects on participation intent through collective efficacy. The sample also exhibited an indirect pathway, social media news use → discussion with colleagues → collective efficacy → participation intent. These findings highlight the roles of communication patterns, work identity and collective efficacy in motivating institutional activists’ political participation.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Digital activism researchers mainly investigate successful social movements and measure such successes by the media platforms that were used during the social movement. However, researchers have failed to interrogate unsuccessful social movements. Such examinations will create an opening for comparative studies for why and how media use help or harm the organization of social movements, particularly when discussing leadership in a social movement. Only a handful of researchers have attempted an empirical study on the importance of leadership in these social movements. Consequently, this paper explores <\/i><i>the importance of leadership in the organization of social movements in Nigeria and<\/i><i> examines how the leadership styles adopted impacted the organization of two social movements in Nigeria. Using response from 34 semi-structured interviews from university students in Nigeria that participated in the protests, the paper finds that Leadership remains crucial to the organization of social movements in Nigeria. Results further indicate that the leadership style adopted impacts the organization of social movements in Nigeria, more so, than the media platform. Results also show that <\/i><i>T<\/i><i>echno-Enthusiasts in 2012 unlike the Nigeria Labour Congress in 2016 used their technological skills <\/i><i>to rouse a<\/i><i> passive generation into action.

A holistic framework of embodiment is deployed to interrogate: (a) the reflexive embodiment process of self-objectification that enables the writing of lyrics to reflect migrant workers’ living condition; (b) migrant workers’ mastery over body techniques for composing melodies and performing their music; (c) as well as the intercorporeality that makes the ‘affective alliance’ between musical worker-performers and worker-audiences possible. The pedagogics, production and performance activities of a migrant worker band from Shenzhen are taken as examples. Through highlighting the bodily dimension, this paper seeks to engage with and advance the scholarship on the nexus between cultural practices and the formation of working-class subjectivity broadly, as well as to enrich our understanding of the ‘new’ workers in contemporary China particularly. It argues that such an alternative form of musical practice is a form of ‘musical resistance’, not only remaking the working-class bodies culturally but also enriching the cultural repertoire for labour contention.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The Canadian Refugees Welcome movement (2015-2016) represented an appealing case for research because it was one of the most sizeable, visible and effective instances of civic collective action in recent Canadian history. It had a nation-wide scope and grassroots initiation. It comprised a wide variety of stakeholders and actively employed social media in its constitution. It attracted intense public attention and left an enduring political and symbolic legacy. Therefore, it is both theoretically and practically important to understand its social and cultural sources, driving forces, and legacies. What led to the rapid growth of the movement and the substantive degree of citizen participation in it? What factors contributed to its high public visibility and effectiveness? What lessons can be learned from its experience?<br /><br />The theoretical concepts guiding this research stem from sociological studies of social movements and collective action on the one hand, and on the other, from media studies focused on the appropriation of new communication technologies by citizens seeking participation in social and political affairs. In the focus of the analysis are the discursive processes of construction of solidarity across difference as they unfolded in the social-media environment. The analysis seeks to explain how collective action frames emerged in the context of the Canadian Refugees Welcome Movement; what actors were involved in their articulation; how they brought together different civic communities and how they generated following, action and political effect.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the emergence of an immigrant driver-owned taxi cooperative in a larger southern city. I examine how “narrative practices” and “communicative spaces” as described by Funke & Wolfson (2014) were crucial for the drivers to transform their grassroots organizing principles into democratic business ideals and overcome what Couldry (2010) described as “problems of voice.” I also examine how their creation of a mobile dispatch application revealed competing visions of cultural identity.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This paper details a field study of two transgender women who have garnered an online audience for their political ideologies through micro-celebrity practices. To study their practices online, their Twitter accounts and several YouTube videos produced by each pertaining to transgender topics were examined using Raun’s framework for micro-celebrity practices based on his observations of a trans feminine blogger on YouTube. The observed content was then examined through a political activist lens using framework from Daskal on digital rights activism to note how their micro-celebrity practices are a form of digital activism.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines political discussion in online platforms to understand the flourishment of populist parties across the globe. A qualitative textual analysis was conducted on posts by supporters of Vox, a populist far-right Spanish party, in the online forum <i>ForoCoches<\/i>. Connective action, affective publics and fandom research informed the main research question: how do Vox supporters use <i>ForoCoches<\/i>? Findings reveal that <i>ForoCoches <\/i>fulfilled three functions for Vox supporters: The practical function referred to mediated communication affordances and memes. The defensive function responded to the pleasure of discussing with those that hold different political opinions. An analysis of such discussion revealed that Vox supporters in <i>ForoCoches<\/i> understand the party as a populist far-right party that advocates for conservative policies and holds traditional values. Finally, the expressive function involved belonging in a community of like-minded people. This community's culture was extremely offensive, ultra-masculine, misogynistic and xenophobic, marked by irony and trolling.\n","Abstract Body: While the influence of digital technologies on political activism has gained considerable attention by scholars in recent years, the relationship between digital media usage and refugee activism, which takes place in three spaces: origin countries, host countries and diasporic transnational spheres, is still insufficiently researched. The current study employs twenty two semi-structured interviews with long-term settled Arab activists with refugee backgrounds to explore the roles of social media in fostering different types of local and transnational activism and protest mobilization practices. As members of conflict-generated diasporas who moved from authoritarian to democratic regimes, Arab activists offer an interesting case study. Cybersecurity, online surveillance, slacktivism and digital propaganda are further discussed as current threats to Arab activists in exile. By examining the online activism practices of such group, the current research brings together political, diaspora and digital media research fields, proposing a new theoretical typology connecting them.\n","Abstract Body: Social movement studies have examined the complex relationship between activists and mainstream news media and the power asymmetry prevalent in this relationship. Resource mobilization and political process studies in social movement literature often refer to the role of the news media in social movement communication processes, but they have not systematically addressed the media’s role in mobilizations. Accordingly, this paper introduces media role theory in mass communication literature and journalism literature into scholarship about social movement-media interaction to build a theoretical framework showing how two media roles of <i>conduit<\/i> and <i>political actor<\/i> shape the way mainstream news media in Western democratic societies interact with social movements, particularly activists. <br />To empirically illustrate how these two roles shape the way media interact with social movement activists, this study presents the 2012-2015 Blockupy protests against the austerity measures of the European Central Bank (ECB) as a critical case study. Using news media texts as data, the study conducts a systematic analysis of the three-year interaction between the activist group Blockupy and the news media. The media’s conduit and political actor roles are identified within these texts using key indicators of media roles drawn from journalism role studies and mass communication studies. The analysis examines, illustrates and elaborates how these two media roles shaped media interaction with activists in this case. <br />This study sheds new light on ways in which news media as organizations participate in and influence mass communication processes involving elite institutional actors (i.e., the ECB) and marginalized actors (i.e., Blockupy) symbolically contesting a target organization’s controversial activity. In doing so it makes two main contributions to theory explaining how activists and their target institutions attempt to mobilize the media for their own ends and how media respond to these attempts. First, it shifts attention away from the media as a homogenous entity (e.g., the ‘mass media’ and ‘media systems’) interacting with activists to the way in which news media as individual organizational entities, such as newspapers, television news programs, radio news programs and news magazines, act in mass communication processes involving activists. Second, this paper introduces into social movement scholarship new theory about two distinct roles of media as organizations that serves to explain how each role influences the way media report on activists and their activities. <br /><br />Keywords: activists, conduit, media roles, political actor\n","Abstract Body: Public awareness of the prevalence and effects of sexual violence in the United States was elevated when the #MeToo movement received global attention in October 2017. Public opinion about the movement resulted in gender and political partisan divides, perhaps due to the movement’s emphasis on challenging gender inequities and common rape myths that may or may not align with the beliefs held by individuals of different political and gender identities. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which rape myth acceptance and perceptions about the seriousness and prevalence of sexual assault in the United States may relate to the perceived impact of the #MeToo movement in the United States and how individual differences by gender and political identification may play a role. A total of 1,185 U.S. citizens completed the relevant measures in an online survey. Participants perceived the impact of the #MeToo movement less positively the more accepting they were of rape myths and the less they perceived sexual assault as a serious and prevalent issues. Republican men reported the highest levels of rape myth acceptance, lowest levels of seriousness about sexual assault, and were the least likely to perceive the movement’s impact positively; whereas, Democratic women reported the lowest levels of rape myth acceptance, highest levels of seriousness about sexual assault, and were the most likely to perceive the movement’s impact positively. Democratic men and Republican women fell in between, but Republican women more closely aligned with Republican men and Democratic men more closely aligned with Democratic women. These results suggest that relevant demographic and ideological group membership (e.g., gender and political identification) and corresponding beliefs can explain how individuals will perceive the impact of social movements about sexual violence against women that challenge or align with those ideological beliefs.\n","Abstract Body: The Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center (ILHMEC) utilizes distinctive place-based claims to justify its location and call for action. I examine how the institution's place-based rhetorics intersect with its arguments for mobilizing Holocaust memory to promote social justice. I contend the ILHMEC advances claims of \"\"ownership\"\" over domestic forms of racial violence to stimulate culpability and responsibility. Yet, ownership claims also signal exclusion and reveal entrenched obstacles to translating Holocaust memory into advocacy efforts.\n","Abstract Body: A growing body of scholarship has shown how continuous and communicable social mobilization depends extensively on collective memories organized into movement narratives. This article sets out to study this formative activity in a changing media landscape; it asks how activists navigate the temporal nexus of mediated collective memory construction. The empirical focus is on the case of Brazil’s Landless Rural Workers’ Movement (MST), a long-standing actor engaged in both collective memory construction and digital media communication. Through a corpus analysis of two types of media sources – the internal newspaper <i>Journal Sem Terra<\/i> (1984-2014) and MST’s Facebook page (2014-2019) – the article demonstrates how collective memories of rural violence has served various functions in these media. The study verifies the formative implication of rural violence for Brazil’s Landless Movement, but also unveils notable differences between the newspaper and Facebook in this regard. Whereas <i>Jornal Sem Terra<\/i> employed a <i>horizontal <\/i>collective memory construction, activated through contemporary documentation of ongoing and upcoming events, the Facebook-posts were primarily engaged in a <i>vertical <\/i>extraction of already established memories. Printed media hence produced a narrative around collective memories of rural violence, memories then re-produced through digital media platforms. Drawing on these findings, the article discusses how the temporal nexus of mediated collective memory construction conveys for social movements both peril and potential.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Engaging in activities that allows social movement actors to share their memories with others helps keep the movement alive after achieving immediate goals. Many studies have focused on sharing movement memories situated within face to face settings. This study expands such a focus by investigating how the actors share the memories on new media platforms. Based on interview and observation data collected from peace movement actors in Ambon, Indonesia, this study found that Facebook, together with messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, facilitated the peace actors to reminisce their memories and recalibrate them in a post-movement phase. Hence, keeping the actors connected over time. Such a post-movement dynamic was feasible in part because of the presence of actors who actively posted meaningful events that triggered the other actors’ recollections, resulting in conversational threads, ideas for subsequent movements, and face-to-face meetings. The present findings have the potential to unfold nuances surrounding the continuity of new media enabled social movements.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This essay conducts a pan-historiographic analysis of Australia’s Stolen Generations Movement by exploring rhetorical tropes of family in conjunction with histories of land-based trauma. In so doing, I demonstrate the ways in which land functions as part of the indigenous nuclear family whilst navigating the rhetorical intersections of people and place in narratives of settler violence. I ground my analysis in three historiographic events that delineate indigenous sovereignty through the analytic lens of land and/as family to frame the ways in which Aboriginal children were used to justify the establishment of racial hierarchies through policies of spatial displacement and familial assimilation.\n","Abstracts: Loudhailers amplify angry speeches, passionate marchers engage in disruptive protest, and bold-fonted angry slogans shout from banners and flyers; the drive to elicit change is driven by many emotions, and righteous anger is front and centre in the public imagination. Other, quieter emotions may also drive activism: pain and sadness, of course, but also hope and faith, and increasingly, humour. As activist practices adapt to new political, economic, and institutional realities, some Australian women are trying to find new ways of engaging with the public. This research explores the ways that diverse feminist online activists use humour and snark to disarm and recontextualise controversial and emotive issues, drawing from data collected in interviews and online listening. Reflecting on these lived experiences of engaging in online activism, the paper explores humour as a protection mechanism and a community-building tool.<br /><br />Bio: Dr Kim Barbour is a qualitative new media researcher, and Senior Lecturer at The University of Adelaide.

Political violence from government policies has largely impacted on the drivers for these women in resisting power and disrupting narratives that perpetuate a demonising of Indigenous people. That anger drives them to stand in our own unique power and demand to be seen. The birth of much social change for Indigenous people has occurred due to the passion and commitment of many strong Indigenous women. Currently, there are numerous Black women who through digital media (and in the academy), are setting the course for deep and uncomfortable conversations around feminism, power, and race. One example of this is in their responses to the #MeToo movement. This paper discusses the ways in which Black women in Australia use their voices in anger and humour to disrupt the dominant paradigm.<br /><br />Bio: Dr Tess Ryan is an Aboriginal woman of Biripai country, originating from Taree, New South Wales.

However, it is a lifestyle and action sport that is changing rapidly. No longer on the fringe, it features as part of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, in mega-events like the X-Games and has a growing global presence from LA in the USA to Bryon Bay, Australia, and from Helsinki in Finland to Kabul in Afghanistan. This paper draws on sociology, women’s and interdisciplinary studies to explore an emerging ethics of skateboarding accompanying these developments. This includes looking at the participation of women, non-binary and LGBTQI+ skaters including those from First Nations and refugee backgrounds and examines how they are represented in social media and the Internet. Of interest are strategies, networks and campaigns they use to highlight their presence and dismantle discriminatory attitudes and harmful behaviours in skateboarding.<br /><br />Bio: Dr Indigo Willing OAM is an Adjunct Research Fellow at the Griffith Centre for Social and Cultural Research, Griffith University and currently lives on Aboriginal Land whose traditional owners are the Jagera and Turrbal people.

However, the phrase “me too” can be traced back to when African-American activist Tarana Burke shared the expression in a private exchange of solidarity with young black girls. Combining social network analysis and a qualitative discourse analysis grounded in a feminist epistemology of reflexivity, this paper draws attention to the exclusivity of popular and networked feminism and elevates the voices of the multiply marginalised survivors of sexual violence who were erased from the dominant narratives of #MeToo. This research analyses the power dynamics within digital feminist networks that reproduce colonial violence and oppression within mainstream neoliberal feminism and extends understandings of how digital networks and technology do not empower marginalised voices equitably.<br /><br />Bio: Dr Verity Trott is a Lecturer is Digital Media Research at Monash University.

The work argues that one way to deploy urban design projects that consider the fears of displacement in gentrifying neighborhoods is to integrate what aspects of the neighborhood existing community actors value and promote advocacy for a future that these participants envision. The project accomplished these goals through “communication asset mapping”, an approach centering on communicative spaces that are of value to existing communities and help to create the capacity for positive social change in the built environment.<br /><br /><i>Keywords: communication asset mapping, design activism, placemaking, gentrification and displacement, Chinatown<\/i>\n","Abstract Body: Visual storytelling methods can reposition participants as coproducers of knowledge (Dutta, 2018) and provide various advantages, such as developing participants’ capacities (Jarldorn, 2019; Willox et al., 2013) and offering a high depth of self-expression (Grimshaw, 2001).  However, these methods are constituted in complex terrains of power, and without continual attenuation to power imbalances, these methods will contribute to the silencing and erasure of marginalized communities.  This paper outlines how reflexivity as a methodological tool can enable the interrogation of the terrains of power, as part of the cultured-centered approach (Dutta, 2008; 2018), allowing for the continual opening of democratic possibilities and the ownership of visual and digital storytelling infrastructures by communities.  The “Poverty is Not Our Future” campaign is outlined as a case study, in which the co-creation of audio-visual advertisements served as a visual narrative of resistance to challenge dominant structures and communicate stories and everyday realities of poverty, among residents living in a poor suburban site in Auckland, New Zealand.  This paper offers an entry point for new and critical thinking about the theorizing of culture and communication and the co-construction of visual stories. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This study asks what makes platforms unique from the perspective of user experience. Through 30 interviews with ride-hailing users in Manila and direct participation, this study identifies four motivations for shifting to ride-hailing platforms: Transaction cost reduction, augmentive function (superior functional qualities), purposive function (helping users pursue life goals), and the insulative function (shielding actors from broader social ills). The paper then highlights the insulative function as a novel concept and explores several theoretical implications.\n","Abstract Body: Blockchain is one of the most widely debated technologies in recent years. Pundits and scholars have described it as a disruptive technology that will impact many sectors of society. Skeptics argue blockchain’s popularity is fuelled by the media’s obsession for the ‘next big thing’ rather than the intrinsic potential of the technology. In this paper, we follow a social constructivist approach with the aim of explaining how different social groups are creating new meanings about this technology. As Communication scholars, we focus on the role media play in framing debates about blockchain. Our analysis relies on a human coding of the most popular news about blockchain circulating on Twitter from October 2014 to July 2018. The findings show the general attitude about blockchain is predominantly positive. The discourses developing around crypto technologies are complex and multifaceted and indicate a general transition in the rhetorical definition of blockchain.\n","Abstract Body: Since its inception, the internet has been as much technological as social, practical as ideological in character. This article examines academic discourse and asks how research on the multifaceted internet has evolved over the past 25 years. In order to investigate the formation of this academic field, we collected articles published in major academic journals dedicated to new media and digital communication as well as mainstream  periodicals in communication studies over the past quarter of a century. Relying on a combination of (semi)automated content analysis and citation analysis, we find that articles related to the internet and its manifold aspects are cited more often than research on other topics. The literature review suggests that as the sociomaterial infrastructure of the internet has become deeply enmeshed in society its study has evolved from a niche pursuit to the discipline’s core area of inquiry.\n","Abstract Body: Social media platforms are characterized by increasingly diverse features and functions, and these facets remain in constant flux over time. This research examines how users define the central qualities of social media platforms – or <i>platform essence <\/i>– and how those qualities depend on the surrounding media environment. In Study 1, we validated original self-report measures of platform essence. In Study 2, we investigated how the social essence, or perceived socialness, of four contemporary platforms shapes key affordances and resources tied to them. Overall, results provide evidence that platform essence – and socialness, in particular – is associated with amplified perceptions of social affordances and resources. Together, this work contributes to the existing literature by exploring how individuals navigate their social media ecologies, as well as how lay theories may shape the experiences and effects of social media use.\n","Abstract Body: The current study presents an initial investigation of reported social media literacy within a family and sets the foundation for future work focusing on an interactive model of social media literacy. This piece provides an important conceptual exploration of the ways that social media literacy deviates from traditional understandings of media literacy and suggests new measures of the construct social media literacy. Results of an online survey of adolescents about their own, their parents, and a younger sibling’s reported social media literacy are reported. Results suggest the relationship between a parent’s social media literacy and their children’s social media literacy is less strongly related than between siblings. These results are discussed using social learning theory and provide future directions for research.\n","Abstracts: This presenter shares lessons learned about how community engagement can be incorporated into empirical research projects so that beyond documenting inequalities, researchers can do something about alleviating them on the ground. The project focuses on evidence-based digital education programs for low-income African-American older adults and women who have been recently released from jail or prison. The talk describes how community-based research involving marginalized populations can be designed and implemented. It reports on collaboration between several faculty members, graduate students, and local community centers serving underprivileged community members. The description will include an explicit discussion of how researchers incorporated feedback they received from those participating in the intervention program.\n","Abstracts: This presentation offers a graduate student’s perspective on the ways that digital technologies impact ethnographic research with hard-to-reach populations. The case study is a three-year ethnography of adults experiencing homelessness in Chicago. Smartphones and social media are novel ethnographic tools for recruiting and keeping up with participants. Yet ethnographers conventionally rely on face-to-face contact over time to develop research relationships and understand everyday context. The presentation addresses this tension by arguing that digital tools are powerful supplements to place-based ethnographies when the research remains sufficiently grounded in shared experience in physical space. For example, becoming Facebook friends with research participants sustains communication with participants who drop out of physical reach and allows for richer data collection through digital observation. Nonetheless, it is critical to gauge when mediated relationships are thinning out due to a lack of face-to-face contact and when digital observations no longer capture shifts in everyday offline life.\n",null,"Abstracts: Digital technologies bring new exciting opportunities to social scientists, both methodologically and as an object of study. This panel brings together five talks in which panelists are unusually open about their methods to allow for conversations that make replication of possible. Digital media offer the potential for quicker data processing, for helping find patterns that are less obvious to the naked eye, for access to information about people’s everyday behavior, for unearthing connections that require large processing power, and the list goes on. Nonetheless, traditional methodological considerations such as sampling bias remain important aspects of research given that more data do not necessarily mean better data. More is sometimes more of the same bad information and can result in mistaken conclusions and may hinder the reproducibility of findings if the large data sets represent sampling biases. The mere existence of more data is also not helpful if much of this is not visible to researchers, and social interactions heretofore accessible to the in-person observer are now restricted to people’s screens to which researchers conducting face-to-face interviews and observations may not be privy. Indeed, opportunities often come hand-in-hand with challenges from data quality to data access, including ethical considerations.<br /><br />This panel brings together scholars doing cutting-edge research both using digital media to study social science questions as well as asking social science questions about digital media’s increasing importance in everyday life. Panelists will explicitly reflect on the behind-the-scenes realities of their experiences, sharing details that are rarely included in the methods sections of papers even though they are essential for understanding how research actually gets done. Panelists come from four continents and represent a wide range of methods, some completely novel, others the application of more traditional approaches in the digital context. Keller reports on the cat-and-mouse game of detecting automated Twitter accounts using computational methods, Humphreys emphasizes the importance of applying careful research design and sampling to qualitative studies, Marler shares insights from his experiences studying the digital media uses of homeless people, Seo describes her intervention study to support low-income older African Americans in their computer and Internet uses, and Correa exposes the challenges of using both interviews and surveys to study rural villagers in Chile.\n","Abstracts: Humphreys argues for detailed methodological description and reflection for qualitative studies that explore the adoption, use, impact, meaning, affordances, and (infra)structures of communication technologies. The point is not to fetishize method to make such research feel “more scientific”. Instead, it is to help both qualitative and quantitative researchers evaluate the quality of such scholarship. The social phenomenon that qualitative researchers tend to study are complex and typically impossible to examine in their entirety, therefore, sampling is often a must requiring that observation be restricted to certain cases rather than gathering data about all existing occurrences. The talk describes a few of the most prominent forms of sampling within qualitative internet research including their challenges. Using the presenter’s own research on mobile and social media, the talk shares examples that demonstrate how and why different sampling techniques might be appropriate for different kinds of internet studies.\n","Abstracts: Automation has become part of the agenda of political communication, and with it came a new type of actor: social bots. One of their key features is that they mimic humans and human behavior. Bots’ presence on social media platforms is challenging for social scientists, who are interested in the formation of public opinion. Once automated actors join the game, their coordinated behavior can fake grassroot movements, initiate a spiral-of-silence in the formation of public opinion, or crowd out authentic users and their tweets. Because they are created to not be detected and blend in with semi-automated accounts, trolls, and sockpuppets, it has become a methodical challenge to study them. This talk will provide insights into how to tackle this new challenge through the case Germany’s 2017 federal election, analzying millions of Twitter accounts to see whether social bots played a role in the election’s outcomes.\n","Abstracts: Patriotic journalism is a documented practice in scenarios of international violent conflict or threat to the national security (Ginosar, 2015). This article discusses how Spanish elite media apply patriotic journalism as part of information warfare (so-called 'fake news') to the case of the non-violent Catalan process towards independence. Liebes’s frames on patriotic journalism (1992) are analyzed on a sample of news stories published by El País during October 2017. The analysis shows that El País used fake news accusations to sanitize the police violence.\n",null,"Abstracts: Comparisons of the diffusion of ‘true’ and ‘false’ news still suffer from deep methodological challenges. Vosoughi et al. report in <i>Science<\/i> (2018) that falsehoods spread faster than the truth, yet focus only on a narrow set of stories flagged by fact-checking organisations. We complement this by systematically comparing the typical dissemination careers on Twitter of articles from mainstream news organisations with articles from outlets on the <i>Hoaxy<\/i> meta-list of ‘fake news’ sites. This identifies human and automated behaviours that vary considerably between sites, and site types.\n","Abstract Body: Online information environments are increasingly the norm in the US, and public institutions such as libraries, which have existed for decades to provide access to information, are configured to share resources and expertise in using digital technology-based resources with their publics. How people rely on the communicative capabilities of libraries is particularly apparent during disaster moments that affect ‘normal’ information resources.  Post-disaster reliance on digital tools is particularly significant for libraries. Approaching the library as communication and material infrastructure, we examine the intersection of material and immaterial resources - physical and digital - and how the library produces, uses, circulates and disseminates resources around disaster episodes. Focusing on 12 communities, our research includes 38 interviews with librarians and 9 interviews with local recovery organizations in order to understand how assessing the library as infrastructure can help to expose its communicative and social position.\n","Abstract Body: The development of information technology allows people to contact governments more easily. The demands and complaints conveyed to governments can not only impact policy-making but also motivate authorities to provide better public service. Many scholars have been interested in antecedents of citizen-initiated contacts. Based upon previous studies, we proposed a“reality-value model”to explore patterns of citizen-initiated government contacts in China. Using data from a nationwide political forum, our findings suggest a sharp increase of online citizen-initiated contacts in China. The large regional variation in number of citizen-initiated contacts can be explained by the reality-value model. Perceived needs, resources and political value play important roles in predicting citizen contact. People from provinces with higher levels of grievance-based needs, internet resources, and conservative value are more likely to contact government.\n","Abstract Body: Social media can be used as effective disaster communication tools for organizations and the general public due to its spontaneous, interactive, and engaging nature. Yet, there has been limited scholarly evidence regarding how social media communication content and source affect people’s engagement during disasters. With the Twitter data of the Arianna Grande concert bombing disaster in 2017, our results from regressions (<i>N <\/i>= 687) showed that (1) social media messages with a support function positively predicted people’s reactive engagement, including likes and shares, (2) social media users were more likely to engage with messages with a high (vs. low) level of richness, and (3) the effects of an informal tone and an emotional tone on reactive and proactive engagement were conditional based on the source (e.g., online media or individuals). Our study offers insights regarding how various users can best communicate on social media during disasters to engage their audiences.\n","Abstract Body: This research project intends to contribute theoretically and empirically to the research stream on co-creation by focusing on the ICT-enabled collective actions of citizens, communities, governmental organizations, business entities, NGOs and other stakeholders. Digital co-creation entails a number of preconditions and challenges due to diverse context, backgrounds of the actors involved and variety of methods used.<br />The subjects of this research study are international Civic Technologies platforms and their communication strategies as presented in their websites.  Hence, the objectives of the research were three-fold – to identify the objectives that platforms are striving to achieve (content), to define the main groups of involved stakeholders (actors), and to determine the co-creation methods (processes).<br />\n","Abstract Body: Some social media users live in social media “news deserts,” while others are embedded in social networks that are rich in news and public affairs content. These news deserts represent a new form of digital inequality—one that arises less from individual resources or civic skills, but rather from structures of social connection. Moreover, these digital inequalities could potentially undermine one of the primary ways in which social media contribute to the public sphere: They may limit incidental exposure to news. This study investigates these digital inequalities, drawing on a nationally representative, online survey collected just before the 2018 U.S. Midterm Elections (N = 1,493). The study finds strong positive relationships between characteristics of social media networks and incidental exposure on social media. Furthermore, sociodemographic variables are related to these network characteristics, and the effects of these socio-demographics are partially mediated by them. Results are discussed in light of prevailing theory about digital inequalities and incidental exposure.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Differences in access to the Internet can have important implications for politics, potentially generating a “democratic divide”. The present study examines the extent to which social media skills influence offline political participation through online information exposure and social media expressive behaviors. We test a model where social media skills influences political participation through selective, cross-cutting exposure and through social media political expression. Results of the survey show that social media skills are positively related to political participation through pro-attitudinal exposure and then through social media expression. However, results suggest that social media skills are negatively related with social media political expression, leading to less political engagement. Implications for social media skills divide and its effect on political participation are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Although age is commonly identified as a key explanatory variable in Internet adoption and use, digital divide studies have not fully explicated why generational differences are associated with disparities in social media use and participation. This study explores how age can function in constituting a distinctive habitus in China, with significant implications for how different generations interact with digital technologies in their daily lives. A comparative analysis on Chinese born in the 1970s and 1990s; cohorts identified in prior literature as having distinct socio-technical educational experiences in China, was conducted on 429 Chinese internet users. Results indicated significant differences among the post-70s and post-90s cohorts in their online experience, exposure and education, which in turn were associated with differences in their social media perception, activities and content creation, including memetic engagement. Findings here act as an empirical reference to illustrate connections between age differences, information capital and habitus, as well as contribute to deepened understandings of how culture influences global digital inequalities.\n","Abstract Body: <br />This study examines the role digital technology played in countering social discrimination in the lives of homeless women in Los Angeles, drawing on several theoretical perspectives on stigma management, positionality, and human agency. Ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews with homeless respondents reveal that these women employed various technologically mediated communicative practices to mitigate their stigmatization at the intersections of homelessness, gender, and class. Digital platforms such as social media and mobile chat apps provided them viable means to pass their stigmas via online self presentation, reframe their stigmatized identities, and challenge the status quo by engaging in individual or collective social change efforts. Further, they tapped into technology affordances to ameliorate their individual capacities, mainly through increased learning and employment opportunities, to boost personal autonomy and seek ways to exit homelessness. The theoretical and empirical contributions of the study are discussed, particularly expanding the traditional models of stigma management communication by suggesting the role of technology as a facilitator and human agency as an important part of the stigma management process.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigated the role of blogs in representing the autistic self and facilitating communication inside and outside the autistic community. Using a sample of sixteen public blogs, the study examined identity management and perceptions of blogging among the autistic bloggers. The study found that bloggers use blogs to create autistic spaces and facilitate communication with readers and commenters. The bloggers use technological tools, such as features that allow followers to adapt the blog’s presentation to their sensory needs. Moreover, findings show that blogging is closely related to the perception of the blog as a safe space; the content is affected by the ‘self-narrating-zoo-exhibit’ metaphor, which is central to members of the autistic culture. This research claims that affordances are understudied in relation to people with disabilities and concludes that the need to further study affordances and blogs as a digital ecosystem exists.\n","Abstract Body: This is an ethnographic study of the ways that low-income, unstably housed residents of Chicago use the internet on public computers. I evaluate through observation how different technological characteristics and different aspects of the institutional and social setting of a library and non-profit shape the where low-income residents choose to use the internet and what they get out of their use in each site. The study challenges digital divide scholars and policymakers to consider the varying motivations, including passing time and socializing, that people have for using public technology resources. Drawing on cultural theories of media and communication, I show how the motivation to enjoy media in the presence of others and feel like home when using the computer shapes the motivations of low-income, particularly homeless, adults, to seek out access outside the library, even when it risks their productivity and digital security. The study reframes the question of public access for low-income communities to better align digital inclusion efforts with the more complex ways that people actually value and use the internet.\n","Abstract Body: Trust in the source of health information has become increasingly critical from the advent of the Internet as primary health information source. Especially as unauthorized entities now have similar gatekeeping power in health information as healthcare professionals. This study strives to conceptualize factors that affect people's trust towards different sources of health information. Specifically, this study propose ICT usage, digital capabilities and skills conceptualized as \"\"techno-capital\"\", and individuals' health support network representing part of health-related social network as critical elements explaining one's level of trust. Furthermore, this study addresses the ways in which social inequality interacts with these factors and relationships by taking advantage of two samples representing different populations within a major US city. Our findings highlight the significance of techno-capital and ICT utilization in explaining the trust of different health information sources as well as interesting mediating role of health support network in one of the sample population.\n","Abstract Body: Digital stress is the stress and anxiety accompanying notifications from and use of informational and communication technologies enabled through mobile and social media. Study 1 identified items from extant measures of digital stress, conducted a qualitative review of the literature to compose new items, and conducted seven focus groups with young adults and adolescents (<i>N<\/i> = 25) to improve item wording and interpretation for a new measure of digital stress. Study 2 (<i>N<\/i>= 249) conducted an exploratory factor analysis of items with a young adult sample collected online. In Study 3, college students (<i>N<\/i> = 174) completed paper-and-pencil surveys using the same items. Results yielded a similar factor structure as detected in Study 2. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted on the combined (Study 2 & Study 3) sample. These procedures yielded 23 items measuring five sub-factors of digital stress: availability stress, approval anxiety, fear of missing out, communication overload, and strength of habit.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Human expectation for superior performance by machines has been documented since the early days of computing, resulting in the concept of “machine heuristic.” However, the concept has not been formally explicated in published literature. This paper makes an initial attempt at explicating it and developing a new scale based on three rounds of data collection (Combined <i>N<\/i> = 1129). In the first round, items were derived from the explication and new items were obtained from respondents via open-ended questions. The second round identified the dimensionality of the formative and reflective indicators through exploratory factor analysis. The third round constructed measurement and structural models of a new scale through confirmatory factor analysis. In the end, we found 25 scale items, forming 6 formative sub-concepts, and 7 reflective items. Theoretical and practical utility of our scale, as well as limitations of the present study and the directions of future research are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Many prior studies suggest that people use electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) to help make decisions. In theory, eWOM is a type of narrative communication where people share their consumption experiences by telling stories. Based on the extended Elaborated Likelihood Model, this study examines the effect of such story-telling from two perspectives, including narrative approach of narrative focus. Through a 4 (narrative approach) × 2 (narrative focus) between-subjects experiment, it is shown that a one-sided comprehensive eWOM message focusing on the primary attribute of the review subject tends to generate the most favorable persuasion effect, and this effect is mediated by perceived message credibility and enjoyment from reading the message.\n","Abstract Body: Online health communities (OHCs) are a common and highly frequented health resource. To create safer resources online, we must know how users think of credibility in these spaces. To understand how new visitors may use cues present within the OHC to establish source credibility, we conducted an online experiment manipulating cues for perceptions of two primary dimensions of credibility – trustworthiness and expertise. We manipulated the presence of <i>likes<\/i> and the presence of moderators’ health credentials using a fake OHC. Our findings showed that moderators with health credentials had an effect on both dimensions of source credibility in OHCs, however, <i>likes<\/i> did not. We also observed a correlation between the perceived social support within the community and both dimensions of source credibility, underscoring the value of supportive online health communities. Our findings can help developers ascertain areas of focus within their communities and users with how perceptions of credibility could help or hinder their own assessments of OHC credibility.\n","Abstract Body: Most American adolescents and teens have a social media presence and are active users of Instagram. Instagram is a way for individuals to connect with others and has been studied in a variety of different health contexts. However, little research has explored Instagram’s contribution to community building through individuals’ self-disclosure with regards to Type 1 diabetes(T1D). This exploratory study employed a content analysis approach to understand self-disclosure through the hashtag “#t1dlookslikeme” in order to explore how individuals with T1D self-disclose their experiences. We gathered publicly available posts that used the hashtag “#t1dlookslikeme.” For this study a total of 423 posts were coded by two trained coders. Our sample contained more positive sentiment posts rather than negative – and these positive sentiment posts were correlated with a higher number of hashtags in each post. This exploratory study will allow for future exploration into self-disclosure of a chronic illness on social media platforms.\n","Abstract Body: The current study aims to explore the trend of Internet health information seeking (IHIS) in cancer survivors, and the relationship between four dimensions of digital divide (e.g., mental access, material access, skills access, and usage access) and IHIS. Data from three iterations (2011, 2013, 2017) of Health Information National Trends Survey were analyzed. Only cancer survivors (2011: n=563; 2013: n=459; 2017: n=504) were included. Results showed that the rate of IHIS among cancer survivors has increased from 53.5% in 2011 to 69.2% in 2017. Also, across the three survey years, material access (e.g., physical Internet access), usage access (e.g., eHealth activities), and mental access (e.g., trust in online health information) have remained a significant and positive relationship with IHIS. Skills access (e.g., health information seeking skills) and the other mental access factor, self-efficacy in health information seeking, were not significantly associated with IHIS over time. We call for targeted interventions to reduce the digital divide barriers for cancer survivors.\n","Abstract Body: As moments of national attention, presidential debates garner media coverage and citizen engagement like few other events in the American election cycle (e.g. Kendall, 1997; Benoit et al., 2003). Conventionally, research on presidential debates has documented how viewing can increase issue knowledge and enhance confidence in vote choice (Benoit, 2013; Winneg & Jamieson, 2017). Technological developments are changing the nature of debate viewing, however. Recently, the literature around debates has begun examining the practice of second-screening during live broadcasts, focusing on the elements of candidate performance that drive social media response and the extent to which dual screeners attempt to influence others (Author & Author, 2015, 2016; forthcoming; Chadwick, O’Loughlin, & Vaccari, 2017).<br />Dual screen interactions using of social media have produced a new expressive engagement with the debate. Watching has become a time of extraordinary interaction via platforms such as Twitter and Facebook. In this respect, the 2016 presidential debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton broke records for television viewership and social media activity. Scholars have started paying increased attention to the dynamic interplay between debate viewing and social media response (e.g. Hawthorne, Houston & Mckinney, 2013; Freelon & Karpf, 2015). Consistent with earlier research that examined how the expressive style, uncivil behaviors, and visual presentation of candidates influences viewer response to the debate and candidate evaluation (Cho, Shah, Nah, & Brossard, 2009; Nagel, Maurer, & Reinemann, 2012), this new line of studies considers how what happens on the big screen influences the volume and valence of expression on the small screen (Author & Author, 2015; 2016; forthcoming). Findings from these studies emphasize how nonverbal and tonal qualities of candidates during presidential debates spur increased real-time social media activity.<br />This paper builds upon the emergent dual-screening literature on presidential debates by pairing detailed coding of expressive behaviors, rhetorical features, and key moments of the first 2016 presidential debate with Twitter responses . To perform the analysis, we coded verbal transcript and video record of the debate from C-SPAN’s split-screen coverage, and then merged these data of the candidates’ verbal, tonal, and visual behaviors with Twitter posts mentioning each candidate. To standardize analysis across different variables, the performance of each candidate was coded at 10-second intervals. Specific instances of communication behaviors were coded for being either present or absent. This process produced 533 codable segments, from their opening statements to their final responses.<br />Two trained coders followed a detailed codebook with variable definitions to document the presence or absence (1 = present, 0 = absent) of each defined category for each candidate. One coder specialized in the verbal variables, while the other coder focused on the nonverbal and tonal variables. The exception was blame and anger language, which were parsed by text analysis software and then converted into dichotomous variables at the segment level.<br />A preliminary descriptive analysis of the data is consistent with Dietrich and Juelich’s (2018) finding on voice tone and issue ownership that there may be meaningful interactions between substantive rhetorical features of candidates and their nonverbal behavior. For example, Clinton rarely used belligerent gestures during the debate, but when discussing topics involving international affairs and defense, the former Secretary of State expressed defiance in nearly 50% of her speaking segments. The same was true of Clinton’s use of angry/threatening facial expressions when discussing policing and crime, which also exceeded 50% of her segments on these topics—a departure from her personal norm.<br />When analysis is complete, the full paper will use dynamic time-series modeling techniques to test the interactive relationship between the substantive and performative dimensions of the debate with the ebb and flow of social media attention to each candidate. Our model includes the volume of Twitter mentions of both candidates during the debate as outcome measures in time series models that employ our communication measures as independent variables.<br />Initial tests for non-stationarity suggest a long-memory process in our outcome variables, indicating they may be more appropriately handled using fractional integration techniques (see Box-Steffensmeier et al., 2014). Accordingly, we plan to use an extension of the Box-Jenkins (1976) modeling approach known as an autoregressive fractionally-integrated moving average (ARFIMA) model (Box-Steffensmeier & Smith, 1998). This should allow for unbiased estimates of the effects of Trump and Clinton’s verbal, tonal and visual style on social media responses.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined what motivates people to adopt internet technologies for privacy protection with data from 11 Asian societies. We argue that political experience on the internet, like political engagement and perceived internet censorship, should be considered in online privacy study. The results show that increasing political engagement leads to higher privacy risk only when people perceive higher level of censorship. Moreover, perceived privacy risk mediates the effect of political engagement and perceived censorship on privacy protection behavior.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Automated tracking of desktop and/or mobile devices usage is increasingly employed for studying user information behaviour in high-choice media environments. However, despite its benefits compared with self-reported data, tracking of participants’ digital traces raises multiple concerns in relation to privacy and user engagement with tracking tools. In our paper, we analyze the results of several focus groups investigating participants' concerns about the use of tracking for academic research and the ways to amend these concerns. Our findings indicate that general perception of online tracking as a research method is strongly affected by corporate research imaginations. We also find that privacy and security are major sources of anxiety for tracking projects’ participants and that participant concerns vary significantly between different tracking contexts. Finally, we found that among different classes of mechanisms used to amend participant concerns, the transparency-based ones receive the most positive evaluations, followed by privacy- and control-based ones.\n","Abstract Body: Much of the rhetoric surrounding body-worn camera adoption, as well as existing academic research, focuses on a few of the techno-regulatory effects of body-worn cameras on police-civilian interactions, such as the rates at which officers use force and the decreasing numbers of complaints against officers (used as a proxy for the notion that officers are improving previous bad behaviors). However, beyond these more public or front-stage police interactions, body-worn cameras may also regulate the information- and communication-related behavior of police officers and civilian police department employees in ways that are not quite so visible from the outside. Importantly, much of the regulatory effects of body camera adoption are due to the possibility that these visual records will be communicated to audiences beyond the individual officers’ control—internally, to supervisors, as well as externally to the media and broader public—who may interpret the visual evidence in ways that differ from the interpretation offered by officers or police agencies, or that hold officer and agencies accountable for wrongdoing. Understanding the full range of ways in which body cameras affect police behavior is an important part of understanding how these technological tools fit into broader police reform efforts, from training to oversight to public communication, providing a richer picture of what body-camera adoption really means in practice—for the police, but also for the communities being policed by officers wearing cameras\n","Abstract Body: Purpose of the paper<br /><br />Video has become a predominant way people consume news and network worldwide (Iqbal, 2019). Online videos open an unprecedented platform for the communication of science and technology between scientists, communicators, and the public. On one hand, they provide new opportunities to educate scientific information (Sugimoto and Thelwall, 2013), yet, they also become playgrounds for misinformation (Syed-Abdul et al., 2013) and manipulation (Lewis, 2018). Despite the rapid growth of online science videos, very little is known about who are producing science YouTube videos (Erviti and Stenglar, 2016), what science information is spread and goes viral, and the effects on public participation (Allgaier, 2019). This paper aims to provide answers to these understudied but fundamental questions in (digital) science communication. We examine 1) <i>who produces viral science videos<\/i>, 2) <i>what are the propaganda/rhetoric strategies that make these science videos go viral<\/i>, and 3) <i>what is the effect of propaganda strategies on civic participation? <\/i>We analyze four science topics, including three politically trenched science topics -- climate change, GMO, and vaccines -- and one emerging science topic -- human genome editing.<br /><br />Main theoretical framework<br /> <br />This paper is grounded in theories in propaganda and deliberative democracy to develop the hypotheses for this paper. On one hand, scholarly works on propaganda or more broadly rhetoric have raised extensive theories on how can understand the propaganda strategies. These strategies include: a) whether a video uses narrative or not (Sakellari, 2015), b) the number of negative words a video contains (Jowett and O’Donnell, 2018), and c) whether a video provides one-sided facts or debates from various sides (Allgaier, 2019). On the other hand, deliberative democracy theorists have pointed out the essential criteria of a high-quality public deliberation, such as whether participants use justifications to back up their opinions and talk to a diverse group of peers. In this paper, we aim to bridge and integrate these two theories by testing the hypotheses of: a). videos that use more narratives are more likely to receive more emotional public comments, b) videos that use more negative words are more likely to receive more emotional public comments, and c) videos that provide one-sided opinions of a science topic are more likely to receive more emotional public comments.<br /> <br />Research methods<br /> <br />One main obstacle facing scholars to address these fundamental questions of digital science communication is the technological difficulty in collecting and analyzing YouTube data systematically (Munger, 2019). In this paper, we collected and analyzed a novel time series dataset of the viral science videos spread between 2015-2019), enabled by a recently developed ‘youtube-data-api’ for social scientists (Yin and Brown, 2018). This API allows scholars to collect meta data of YouTube videos such as # of likes/shares and text data such as video transcripts and public comments.<br /><br />We first developed 10-20 search words for the four science topics based on a literature review of what scholars used as search words for climate change (Allganier, 2019), GMO (Howell et al., 2018), vaccine (Kata, 2010), and human genome editing (Kirkpatrick et al., 2018) as well as applying computer-assisted keyword discovery method (King, Lam and Roberts, 2017) to enrich the search word lists. After this, we used random sampling method to collect the top viewed 2000 videos for each science topic in the past four years. The video information we collected include both the meta level data of videos such as # of likes/shares/comments and text level data such as video transcripts, public comments of a video, and video producers’ profiles.<br /><br />Computational content analysis is conducted to analyze the propaganda strategies used in each science video from the video transcripts. For instance, in order to know how many negative words a video contains, we use the NLTK sentiment toolkit to calculate the number of negative words appeared in a video’s transcript. To know to what extent a video contains storytelling, we use the LIWC dictionary (variables such as “analytical thinking” and “emotional tones”). To analyze the quality of public comments under a video, we also use computational methods (i.e., mainly dictionary methods) to analyze the emotional polarization of public comments as well as the extent of critical thinking in public comments. All of the above computational methods are validated by human researchers through hand coding a random sample of videos and public comments to check whether computational methods provide valid analysis of the propaganda strategies used in these videos and quality of public comments.<br /> <br />Expected findings<br /><br />Some main expected findings are: a). videos that use more narratives are more likely to receive more emotional public comments, b) videos that use more negative words are more likely to receive more emotional public comments, and c) videos that provide one-sided opinions of a science topic are more likely to receive more emotional public comments.<br /> <br />Contribution to CAT scholarship<br /><br />This paper brings new knowledge to the field of science communication and ICT by revealing the affordability and challenges online video platforms pose to communicating science especially controversial science topics. There has been extensive research on studying public communication on Twitter and Facebook, but much less in understanding communication on YouTube, the second largest social network channel in the U.S. In this paper, we take an interdisciplinary approach to studying public communication on YouTube, thus bridging theories across disciplines, including propaganda (Jowett and O’Donnell, 2018) and framing (Scheufele and Iyengar, 2012) in communication to analyze video contents, and deliberative democracy (Fishkin, 2018) in political science to evaluate public engagement.<br /><br />This paper also establishes a methodological example of how we can collect, analyze, and evaluate public communication in the digital space. For instance, this paper will demonstrate how to systematically collect YouTube data to overcome the algorithmic bias in search terms, provide measurable coding schemes to identify propaganda strategies that make videos go viral, and show how to leverage various machine learning and evaluation methods to study large-scale video data.\n","Abstract Body: Studies demonstrated that the online environment may generate social capital (Ellison, Steinfield & Lampe 2007; Vitak, Ellison & Steinfield 2011; Wellman et al. 2001; Williams 2007), that is, the compound of interpersonal relationships and the resources acquired from them that scholars (Coleman 1988; Putnam 2000) identified as central to cooperation. The inherent social structure of social media allows the construction and maintenance of online weak and strong social ties that consequently lead to the creation of online bridging and bonding social capital (Ellison, Steinfield & Lampe 2007, 2011; Williams 2006). The strength of the online bridging social capital lies in the increased ability to get access to innovative information and knowledge and to build consensus among different groups of people. The strength of online bonding social capital is the social and emotional support and trust that exist among tightly knit relationships. The resources acquired from the two types of relationships (bridging and bonding) have different potentials to promote cooperation. Of interest to this study is an examination of which type of online social capital can act as a mediating mechanism between social media use and offline protest participation, that is whether the protest-related affordances offered by social media are facilitated through online bridging or bonding social ties. And although there have been numerous studies on the types of social capital people build online (Ellison, Steinfield & Lampe 2007; Ellison et al. 2014; Kobayashi 2010; Vitak, Ellison & Steinfield 2011; Wellman et al. 2001; Williams 2007), only a limited number have examined online bridging and bonding social capital as mediating mechanism between social media use and protest participation (Gibson & McAllister 2013; Hwang & Kim 2015; Skoric, Ying & Ng 2009) and the findings of these studies are mixed and inconclusive. This gap and the inconsistency of results are the main reasons the current study focuses on the types of social capital relevant for protest participation. More than this, this study is the first to touch upon the development of social capital in the post-Soviet online space, one of the least researched non-Western contexts.<br /> <br />Therefore, this study examines the impact of Facebook in particular and online social capital (bridging and bonding) on offline protest participation through the case of the post-Soviet Moldova: a hybrid state with a politically monopolised media, but a relatively uncensored internet. Specifically, it analyses the Moldovan protests against the governing political elites of 2015.<br /> <br />In order to achieve this, a mixed methods research design was adopted in this study. This design combines both quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. The first quantitative phase consisted of a web survey that was administered through Facebook messenger and completed by protesters. The data were used to examine statistically the relationship between social media, online social capital and protest participation. The second qualitative phase consisted of semi-structured interviews with protesters and activists. Thematic analysis of data allowed to explain quantitative results in more depth.<br /> <br />The findings of the two phases demonstrated that Facebook use had an impact on protest participation and this was mediated by online bridging social capital. This finding was unexpected and surprising because Moldova, as with many other successor states of the Soviet Union, has a low level of offline bridging social capital but a high level of bonding social capital (Howard 2003; Lasinska 2013). This led to the assumption that even online, people will build high levels of bonding social capital and people will rely on the social and emotional support and feelings of security that this type of social capital bring in when deciding to engage in protests. However, both phases of the mixed methods design indicated the opposite. Facebook users built online what they lacked offline - bridging social capital. In a politically monopolised media society and contexts where social interactions offline are so tightly knit (high level of bonding social capital) that they do not allow the entrance of unconventional information and novelty, Facebook offered its users a space to interact with a larger and diverse network, access alternative information and build bridging social capital, essential for a participatory democracy in a post-Soviet environment otherwise lacking it. The fact that users built bridging social capital online also characterises a young, more curious and trustful post-Soviet generation, which matches Western contexts in its digital skills and democratic orientations.<br /> <br />On the whole, this study provides a contribution to the under-researched area of online social capital as an antecedent of protest participation and the under-researched post-Soviet space. This study showed that those who adhered to social media to connect with bridging ties and capitalise on the resources these bring were more likely to become interested and engaged in offline protests. The study also demonstrated that the type of social capital developed online was determined by the offline context (Kobayashi, Ikeda & Miyata 2006) and, more specifically, lack of bridging social capital offline. This points to the need for discerning between different types of social capital and the contexts where these are developed – online and offline – but also acknowledging that these are mutually constitutive. This means first that social media usage is endogenous to community characteristics and contextual factors, and the interplay of different online and offline political and social factors shaped its importance for participation.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The increased accessibility and availability of health information on social media empower older people to get information on how to manage their health (Hanson et al., 2011). However, the rampant presence of misinformation, the rise of rumors, and the phenomenon of information overload in cyberspace can also put senior social media users in a position vulnerable to negative health outcomes (Li, Tang, Liu, & Ma, 2019; Manafo & Wong, 2012; Moorhead et al., 2013; Tan, Lee, & Chae, 2015). In this study, we seek to explore older people’ use of social media for health information management with particular focuses on information receiving, processing, and circulation among older social media users aged 65 or over.<br />Information receiving involves individuals’ acquisition of information through active information seeking or passive exposure to information (Ruppel, 2016; Zhang, Jung, & Chen, 2019). Although a large literature has been developed to explain motivations for information seeking, most of such studies revolve around cancer-related information seeking (Kelly et al., 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010; Shim, Kelly, & Hornik, 2006). Only until recently have more studies emerged to examine older adults’ use of social media to acquire health information in non–life threatening circumstances (Zhang, Jung, & Chen, 2019). Thus, we aim to fill the gap in the literature by examining older social media users’ information receiving behavior and the impacts on their management of day-to-day health.<br />Information processing refers to “the gathering, interpreting, and synthesis of information” to facilitate one’s decision making (Thomas & Trevino, 1993, p. 780). Past research suggests that older people rely heavily on source credibility (Macias & McMillan, 2008; McMillan, Avery, & Macias, 2008), past experiences (Chang, Basnyat, & Teo, 2014; Waters, Wheeler, & Hamilton, 2016), and personal networks (Hayashi et al., 2019) to evaluate the trustworthiness of health information. This raises the concern regarding what strategies older social media users would adopt to evaluate information circulated in the virtual community.<br />Studies have also illustrated that older adults’ preferred information sources are friends and acquaintances in their existing social networks (Chang et al., 2014). As more older adults become social media savvy, sharing health information on social media may not only fulfill older users’ information need but become a major source of social support (Liu, Yang, & Sun, 2018; Maloney-Krichmar & Preece, 2005). This raises the need to examine how older adults use social media to exchange support with their peers through health information sharing.<br />Altogether, to develop a comprehensive understanding of older social media users’ information behaviors, we posed three research questions: 1) How do older adults receive health information through social media; 2) How do older adults process health information from social media; and 3) How do older adults share health information on social media?<br />The studied context involves older adults aged 65 and over who use WeChat to access health information. WeChat is a multi-purpose mobile application with the primary function of messaging. It also allows users to post texts, photos, short videos, music, and using the “Moments” function (similar to Facebook’s timeline function) and provides businesses, organizations, and even individuals with a platform to establish public accounts (similar to Facebook pages) to reach users through subscription accounts (Tencent, 2018). It is ranked as the most popular platform for health information receiving and sharing in China (Zhang, Jung, & Chen, 2019).<br />Semi-structured in-depth interviews with 23 WeChat users aged 65 to 85 (M = 69.26; SD = 5.39) were conducted between June and September 2019 in a major southern city in China. Guided by the grounded theory approach, three themes were extracted from the data (Braun & Clarke, 2013).<br />The first theme revealed older users’ passive and specific information-receiving patterns. Most participants claimed that they did not receive information from original sources (e.g., official accounts) but from forwarded messages about healthcare and health products on WeChat at random. Even for those active information seekers, they preferred to obtain information from private WeChat groups made up of their offline personal networks (e.g., old classmate groups, community groups, and family groups) rather than receiving news feeds from public WeChat accounts. These findings are line with existing literature that indicates perceived vulnerability and perceived relevance are critical to seniors’ health information-seeking behaviors (Zhang, Jung, &Chen, 2019).<br />The second theme delineated older users’ information processing based on their life experiences and expediency. The participants revealed that they would easily trust information that coincided with their past experiences or was relevant to their or their loved ones’ ailments. When feeling suspicious, they often chose to ignore information rather than verify it. The circulation of information among peers and a lack of vigilance in verifying information sources may increase the risk for older social media users to be the victims of misinformation.<br />The third theme addressed participants’ selective information sharing based on their evaluation of the usefulness and relevance of certain information. Information such as medical treatments would be forwarded to those who were considered in need of knowledge. However, to avoid being challenged in front of a specific recipient, participants preferred to share information in groups as opposed to one-on-one sharing. Similarly, participants tended to forward the information to their peers, not to their children. This was to avoid potential inter-generational tensions due to different understandings and experiences of health and illness.\n","Abstract Body: Current generations of virtual assistants such as Alexa are designed to unobtrusively assist daily tasks (Krupansky, 2017), including information search and online shopping. Although virtual assistant technology is one of the major innovations in human-computer interaction (HCI), very few studies investigated the underlying psychology of consumers who interact with virtual assistants for shopping. The current study conducted a lab experiment to fill the gap and parse out how users perceive virtual assistants’ dialogue that helps their shopping tasks, and how the perception of social presence influences users’ attitudes toward the technology.\n","Abstract Body: Virtual reality (VR) allows people to take the perspective of another individual through embodying an avatar in virtual environments. Embodied perspective taking has been examined within various contexts, with an increasing number of studies investigating the effects of race embodiment in virtual reality. Results appear to be inconsistent in promoting pro-social intergroup attitudes such as reducing racial bias. In Peck et al.’s (2013) study, white participants who embodied a dark-skinned avatar reported the largest decrease in racial prejudice. Banakou, Hanumanthu, and Slater (2016) found that implicit racial bias decreased more for individuals who embodied a black virtual body as compared to those who embodied a white virtual body. In contrast, Groom et al. (2009) found that white participants who embodied a black avatar reported stronger negative racial bias toward black people. Hasler, Spanlang, and Slater (2017) asked white female participants to embody either a white or black avatar and found no significant change in implicit racial bias. However, among participants who embodied a black avatar, the extent to which they liked their virtual partner was associated with a reduction in implicit bias, which may have resulted from a positive interaction experience. The inconsistent findings may be due to the subjective evaluation of the interaction experiences occurred in VR. Similar argument can be found in intergroup contact theory literature with regards to the effect of positive and negative intergroup contact on prejudice reduction. To further investigate what determines the direction of the effect on reduction of racial bias in VR, we propose to examine how the valence (positive vs. negative) of intergroup contact in VR experience influence prosocial attitudes.<br /><br />Intergroup contact theory has a long tradition in studying the effect of various interaction between majority and minority groups on intergroup attitudes. Past research showed that greater intergroup contact corresponds with lower levels of intergroup prejudice, but with exceptions (see Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Incidentally, Hayward et al. (2017) has called for more research to understand subjective nature of contact experiences as well as the effect of contact valence (negative and positive contact) to further understand the inconsistent results. Negative contact can be broadly defined as having negative or unenjoyable interaction with outgroup members or unpleasant experiences such as being belittled or intimidated by outgroup members. Positive contact refers to positive or enjoyable interaction with outgroup members. Based on Barlow et al’s (2012) positive-negative contact asymmetry, several studies have shown that negative intergroup contact predicts prejudice more strongly than positive contact predicts prejudice reduction (Alperin et al, 2014). On the contrary, Aberson’s (2015) study found that negative contact is not a stronger predictor towards intergroup attitudes and different cultural groups experience contact differently. As more research is needed to know the effect of contact valence, this study seeks to investigate the effect of negative and positive contact valence on intergroup attitudes within a racial embodiment VR situation. The following research question is proposed:<br /><br /><i>RQ1: What are the effects of positive and negative contact valence in VR on intergroup attitudes?<\/i><br /><br />         When taking the perspective of another, individuals can either imagine (a) how the other person considers the situation and feels about it or (b) how they, themselves, would perceive the situation and personally feel if they were in the other person’s position (Batson et al., 1997). Todd & Burgmer (2013) investigated the effects of these two types of perspective taking on intergroup outcomes without VR and found positive relationships. Applying this to VR, an individual can embody an avatar either as him/herself or as another person. Past VR studies have not accounted for this critical distinction and, instead, have focused exclusively on either embodying another person in VR (Banakou et al., 2016; Groom et al., 2009) or themselves (Fox et al., 2013; Oh et al., 2016). To address this gap, we compared the relative efficacy of self- and other-embodied perspective taking in influencing intergroup attitudes. As such, we propose the following research question:<br /><i>RQ2: What are the effects of self embodiment and other embodiment in VR on intergroup attitudes? <\/i><br /><br />            In the Singapore context, tensions exist between the light-skinned Chinese majority of the population and dark-skinned low income foreign workers from Bangladesh. We test our propositions in a 2 (contact valence: positive vs. negative) X 2 (embodied perspective-taking: self-ingroup vs. other-outgroup) experiment where Chinese Singaporean participants embody either themselves or a Bangladeshi construction worker. In a virtual mirror, participants who embody Bangladesh avatar are given time to explore their avatar’s appearance and movements. After the body transfer procedure is successful, participants are led to notice a Chinese non-playable character (NPC) who has gotten into an accident and is in need of help. The NPC is programmed to elicit either a positive or negative interaction at this point. In the positive condition, the NPC asks for help in a courteous manner. In the negative condition, the NPC rudely refuses help. As a behavioral measure, the participant is then given a choice to either help the NPC, or walk away. The time taken for the participant to respond is recorded. If the participant chooses to help, the NPC responds in a thankful manner (positive condition), or in an irritable way (negative condition). Participants who embody themselves go through a similar experience, with the Chinese NPC now replaced with a Bangladeshi NPC. The participant then fills out a post-test questionnaire with measures on implicit racial bias, prejudice and intergroup anxiety. All variables are measured before the experiment to evaluate pre-experiment vs post-experiment scores.<br /><br />            This study contributes to theoretical advancement on virtual embodiment effects as well as intergroup contact theory by examining how contact valence is related to reduction of racial bias. Findings from this study will help researchers understand how to develop effective virtual reality interventions to reduce negative racial attitudes and promote pro-social attitudes.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Digital technology is already making decisions in finance, health, dating, commerce, and many other domains that affect our everyday lives, whether we like it or not. Until recently, much of this decision-making was strictly a privilege of humans. Much public debate is preoccupied with the shifting authority from individual humans to algorithms and AI. As machines are increasingly acting as autonomous agents, fears are that ultimately we will give up the idea that humans are autonomous agents. Paradoxically, reliance on the very same technology is rapidly increasing, suggesting that potentially losing control is not necessarily preventing our acceptance of machine decision-makers. Therefore, this research starts by asking two basic questions: <br />1. As we encounter machine-made decisions, do we feel that our sense of being autonomous agents is compromised? <br />2. What are the circumstances under which we accept the technology and its decisions regardless?\n","Abstract Body: When Oculus raised $2.5 million in a 2012 Kickstarter campaign for an inexpensive Virtual Reality (VR) display, it signalled a revitalization of the medium through collaborative production. The first headsets sent to funders were non-commercial development kits (DKs), with which fans were expected to tinker in pursuit of both realizing the technology’s potential and create novel content.<br /><br />However, not every fan could experiment with the “Rift” headset. Since designing VR experiences required existing software, from the Unity game engine to modeling programs like Maya, those with expertise in gaming and programming were first to use the head-mounted displays (HMDs). And they wanted to make games: immediately porting 2D versions to the device. These efforts, built on early users’ passion, provided valuable feedback for Oculus before commercial release of its hardware while simultaneously solidifying in the public imagination that VR was for gameplay, a position the company reinforced (Kedmey, 2015).<br /><br />This presentation will use the Oculus “Rift” as a case study to investigate how a production system built on the playful labor of early adopters impacts the diffusion of innovations (Rogers, 2003). By design, Oculus ensured not only its product’s immediate success by getting early enthusiasts to play with it, but also bound them to the company and its platform.<br /><br />Literature Review<br /><br />Virtual Reality has been researched in communications for over three decades (e.g. Biocca & Levy, 1995). While a majority of studies explore the efficacy of HMDs and virtual environments as tools for meaningful interaction and community formation, such as their ability to elicit empathy (Herrera et al., 2018), the technology is also inextricably linked to industry. In fact, Jaron Lanier, who is credited with coining the term “virtual reality,” conceived of it in part to explain the products his company was manufacturing.<br /><br />Corporate decision-making has driven the innovation’s diffusion: for instance, Nintendo failed to successfully popularize its VR device in the 1990s by focusing on marketing two-dimensional games (Boyer, 2009). Additionally, a growing body of work focuses on the key role Oculus and its founder Palmer Luckey played in shaping public awareness of the technology as not only an extension of the body (Golding, 2017), but also a representation of misogynistic gamer culture (Harley, 2019).<br /><br />Further, Oculus’ sale to Facebook embedded VR into an environment where corporations hold tight economic and infrastructural reign over the creative potential of digital technologies, what Nieborg and Poell (2018) categorize as the “platformization of cultural production.” As with many contemporary innovations, from smart assistants to robots, Oculus incorporated common “platformized” practices: its headsets were interoperable with other platforms (Bechmann, 2013) and employed DKs and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to woo early adopters’ and enthusiasts to playfully test their products before they came to market.<br /><br />Such experimentation is not unusual in media history; early radio was dominated by dabblers (Dunbar-Hester, 2014). However, Oculus’ hardware releases relied on playbor (Kücklich, 2005): it profited from developers who tested the limits of its headsets and created marketable content while simultaneously expending significant free labor (Terranova, 2000) and evangelizing for the company.<br /><br />Thus, a study of the Oculus Rift, its development as a platform and its effect on early users is both warranted and contributes to ongoing concerns in communication and technology studies. The Rift epitomizes the relationship between political-economic theory and technological practice in the adoption of current Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), as well as the limits imposed on seemingly open and inchoate innovations as they diffuse to consumers.<br /><br />Method and Theoretical Framework<br /><br />Employing a multimethod approach, first a platform analysis (van Dijck, 2013) of the device based upon a framework of political-economy and actor-network theory will be performed. Van Dijck advocates for study of the technology, users and usage, content and cultural form, ownership, governance and business model of platforms. Material for this qualitative analysis will be garnered inductively and include popular media and academic publications about Oculus, its products and affiliated software. Second, building on earlier research (AUTHOR, 2018), semi-structured interviews with early enthusiasts explore how a production system dependent on playful experimentation influenced perceptions of the Oculus brand and cemented it as the de facto VR headset.<br /><br />Potential Findings and Conclusions<br /><br />Even though research is ongoing, van Dijck’s (2013) process begins to paint a picture of Oculus as a platform. The development of the “Rift” technology stemmed from a kind of playful experimentation, as Luckey famously hacked existing smartphones to produce a low cost headset (Clark, 2014). This, along with the release of DKs, solidified the notion of VR as ideal for tweaking and modification.<br /><br />It also affected users and usage, attracting early adopters and funders who, rather than being passive consumers, had the know-how to test the HMDs. This group, already steeped in platformized app development and gaming shaped early usage, building more theoretical experiments, like swapping bodies with different genders (Kuchera, 2014), using interoperable software like Unity and circulating them via mainstream outlets like Valve’s “Steam” store.<br /><br />Interoperability was also built into Oculus’ ownership and business model which focuses on hardware manufacturing. The Rift serves as a conduit between content creators, compatible programs and distribution services. Through technical and legal restrictions, Oculus governs what systems, platforms and software are in sync with its product, while remaining relatively neutral about the amateur and professional content generated.<br /><br />Despite this level of control, interviews reveal a different perspective of Oculus. For early adopters, heir technology offered a playground of limitless possibilities and a first step toward realizing childhood dreams of “cyberspace.” However, their play was implicitly and explicitly regulated by Oculus’ technology, which caused frustration for those not versed in tools to make what was considered the default genre: games.<br />Ultimately, findings underscore how Oculus is emblematic of an increasingly common practice: incorporating and capitalizing upon the playful experimentation and efforts of early developers/consumers in the conception, production and distribution of innovations within the “tech” industry.<br /><br />References<br />(AUTHOR, 2018)<br />Bechmann, A.

It adds the olfactory stimuli to the participants, to see if this enhances their experience and learning. The Chinese Tea Ceremony was chosen as the ICH experience. My hyphothesis is that <i>Sense of presence, levels of emphaty, satisfaction, and of short term memory will be higher in immersive VR + olfactory stimuli, and consequently there will be higher levels of knowledge acquisition. <\/i>By the time of submission, 92 people had participated in the experiment (which will be finished by January, 2020). Preliminary assessment points to support the hypothesis.\n","Abstract Body: A between-subjects experiment will examine the impact of perceived fear of falling while using a virtual reality (VR) experience on perceived presence, attention, enjoyment, information recall, and performance. Participants (N=72) will be asked to play a VR escape room game using the HTC Vive and randomly assigned to either an “ideal playing field” or one in which the perceived fear of falling is heightened by intruding objects. Drawing on the concept of breaks in presence (Slater, 2000) and LC4MP (Lang, 2000), we hypothesize (H1) that a heightened fear of falling in the real world will create “breaks in presence” (BIP) that will elicit lower levels of a) perceived presence, b) enjoyment, c) attention, and d) performance compared to those playing in “ideal” conditions. We also predict (H2) that BiP will overload cognitive resources and lead to a) lower levels of information recall and b) poorer game performance.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: Risk perception, fear of falling, virtual reality\n","Abstracts: Militarised drones have become one of the primary weapons in the arsenal of the US and other states,but the violent events they produce are largely invisible to Western publics, their operations are cloaked in secrecy, and a dense cloud of promises – precision targeting, accurate surveillance, legal monitoring – obscures their brutalities. And yet even as drones make violent events invisible, they depend on making bodies and battlefields visible in order to project power. This paper analyses the military drone as a remote-sensing media technology to show how this tension between visibility and invisibility both enables violent events and limits knowledge about them. Recognising that drone violence is all too visible for those within the frames of war, it proposes a framework of “nonhuman witnessing” as a conceptual and methodological response to the problems of opacity, distance and deniability that limit public and political engagement with drone warfare.\n","Abstracts: How do you study events when they are, by their nature, constantly evolving? Where does the event (and therefore one’s study of it) begin and end? Representations of events need to be taken up and handed off by a myriad social and political actors in order for the event to be recognised as historic. Tracing the evolving construction of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution article on Wikipedia from the first day of protests, I demonstrate the ways in which the platform acted as a hub for the circulation of signs and symbols, gestures and exchanges, images and texts as different constituencies contended for control of the event. By defining key moments during which the event’s representations needed to be handed off in order to retain its liveness, I outline a methodology for understanding the power relations that define the practice of narrating historic events in open, online systems.\n","Abstracts: Events are central to populist communication strategies – not only responding to them but creating them. Populists thrive on disruptive performances that expose the inefficacy of an out-of-touch elite and present the populist disrupters as authentic and efficacious in an eye-catching way. This paper analyses populist performances of disruptive events in the two contrasting contexts of the UK and South Africa. Recognising both the material and imaginary qualities of technology as key to the creation of political events, it develops the concept of “performative assemblages” to show how populists integrate live symbolic action with digital technology in an attempt to control the public meaning of events. Adopting a hermeneutic approach to the study of constructed political events, it maps digital onto live symbolic action. It argues that populist performative assemblages speak particularly well to three criteria of political representation in the new media environment (Coleman, 2011): visibility, authenticity and efficacy.\n","Abstract Body: Political disagreements in social media can result in removing (i.e., “unfriending”) a person from one’s online network. This article proposes that political disagreements leading to such drastic measures are attributable to more deeply rooted <i>moral<\/i>dissents. Drawing on moral foundations theory and relationship regulation research, this work presents empirical evidence from two experiments. In both studies, subjects rated political statements (that violated different moral foundations) based on perceived reprehensibility and the likelihood of unfriending the source. Study 1 (<i>N<\/i>= 721) revealed that moral judgments of a political statement are moderately related to the unfriending decision. Study 2 (<i>N<\/i>= 822) replicated this finding but indicated that unfriending is less likely when the source of the morally reprehensible statement is relationally close to the unfriender and provides emotional support. This research offers initial evidence uncovering the psychological trade-off behind the decision of terminating digital ties in face of moral disagreements.\n","Abstract Body: Although numerous studies have examined either social capital or envy on Facebook, little research has investigated these concepts together. To more systematically understand how social capital and envy on Facebook influence a user’s Facebook use, we examined both factors together. In this study, we examined whether (and how) social capital and envy on Facebook influence a user’s Facebook use, focusing on: 1) change in Facebook use frequency; and 2) intention to continue using Facebook with the effects of the other factor controlled for. Regression analyses of online survey data obtained from 703 respondents showed that bridging social capital on Facebook was positively associated with Facebook use over time, while envy on Facebook was negatively associated with Facebook use, with the other factor controlled for. We also found that bonding and bridging social capital were positively associated with intention to continue using Facebook, but envy on Facebook had insignificant effects on this intention. This finding indicates that, while people feel envious of others on Facebook—and thus face some negative consequences—they might still want to use Facebook because of the advantages they can obtain from social networks on Facebook, such as emotional support and new information or insights.<br /><br /><br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: Facebook, Social capital, Envy, Facebook use frequency, Facebook use intention\n","Abstract Body: Personal uncertainty refers to uncertainty about the nature of a target person, whereas interpersonal uncertainty refers to uncertainty about the target’s unique reactions to a person (Walther, 2019). With a 2 (target’s behavior: positive vs. negative) x 3 (information type: self-generated vs. other-generated vs. interaction) web-based experiment, this study investigated how online information reduces both types of uncertainties. It was found that negative information reduces both uncertainties more than positive information, but this effect was not observed on individuals with a high positivism bias in social interactions. A higher positivism bias led to lower interpersonal uncertainties about a target, but it had no effect on personal uncertainty reduction. Information type did not influence the reduction of either uncertainty. The study provides initial empirical evidence for the distinction between personal and interpersonal uncertainties as well as how they are affected differently by information on social media.\n","Abstract Body: In a world where everyone is constantly connected with others via different communication technologies, managing unavailability is just as important, if not more, as managing availability. Since one’s availability may vary as a result of the social relationships the interactants have with them, the strategies they use may differ consequently. In this paper, we conducted an online survey study (n= 475) to explore the connection between one’s relationship with different interactants (significant other, family members, close friends, acquaintances, group chat with friends and group chat with acquaintances) and the frequency they manage availability as well as butler lies, a specific deceptive linguistic strategy of managing availability, with these interactants. We found that the relational factors, such as facework, privacy for tool use, and interpersonal privacy do make a difference. Notably, people tell butler lies most frequently to acquaintances and groups of acquaintances but least to significant others. We also found that practices of availability management and butler lies were mediated by people’s conversational grounding and trust. Theoretical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study aimed to compare the effects of immersive virtual reality (IVR) videos and 2D educational videos on cognitive (i.e. conceptual knowledge) and non-cognitive (i.e. self-efficacy) learning outcomes. Fifty-three students from an all-girls middle school learned about humans’ impact on the ocean through either IVR videos, using a virtual reality (VR) headset, or through 2D videos, using a computer monitor. Results replicate previous findings suggesting that conceptual knowledge gains between IVR and desktop learning experiences is not significant. Also, results show that participants who watched IVR videos reported higher self-efficacy scores and expressed higher feelings of presence than participants who watched the same videos using a computer monitor. Finally, further analyses revealed that the feeling of presence mediated both cognitive and non-cognitive learning outcomes.\n","Abstract Body: Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is a promising tool to reduce public speaking anxiety (PSA) in adults. However, treatment and prevention of PSA in children has been neglected. We examined whether brief repeated exposures to a virtual audience embedded in a speech app help to reduce (1) state anxiety during three public speaking training sessions, (2) state anxiety during the actual presentation that followed, and (3) trait PSA from the first training session until after the actual presentation in children aged 9-12 years. First, we found, as expected, a decrease in state anxiety during the training sessions, although the third session did not have any benefit. Second, as expected, the training group reported lower state anxiety during the actual presentation than the control group. Finally, we found, as expected, a decrease in trait PSA from the first training session until after the actual presentation for the training group, but not for the control group. Taking into account the discussed limitations, the usage of VRET in children to reduce PSA seems promising.\n","Abstract Body: Existing studies on digital media and labor seldom pay attention to youth in vocational education (VE), nor do they consider the use of and attitudes towards digital media in connection with labor subjectivity. This research fills the gap by exploring how patterns of digital communication, be they consumerist or reflective, relate to each other in exerting influence on labor knowledge and attitudes in the setting of a vocational school. We present findings from a unique survey dataset (N=1,761) collected in Shaanxi, China. Aided by fieldwork, interviews, and observations of online discussions among students, we constructed reliable composite variables for behavioral and attitudinal patterns of digital communication and found that (a) participation in online forum discussion enhances labor-rights knowledge and predicts more consumerist usage of WeChat, but it does not encourage more reflections on gaming or achieve more labor-related attitudes; (b) reflective attitudes does not increase labor knowledge, but it is positively correlated with work-related attitudes; (c) there is no significant relationship between consumerist usage on the one hand and labor knowledge or attitudes on the other; and (d) labor knowledge indeed helps enhance labor attitudes. Contributions and implications of these findings are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Immersive Virtual Reality (VR) offers an interactive environment that anyone can experience via their smartphones and affordable goggles. VR technology allows users to experiment, practice, and adapt their communication skills in contexts that cannot be achieved in the real world without creating relational tensions. VR Learning Environments (VLE) may be an effective instructional tool for teaching sensitive topics, such as matters regarding race, which often make students apprehensive to discuss in traditional classroom settings. In this study, we utilize pre-experiment and quasi-experimental design to assess the effectiveness of VR utilization as an innovative pedagogical tool for intercultural communication education. Seventy-three college students participated in a VLE depicting an intercultural interaction that may or may not have involved a racial microaggression depending on their choices made within the scenario. Results of the study indicate that students’ affinity for VR is the strongest predictor for confidence in using VR for educational contexts while aversiveness for VR technology is a significant mediator of one’s attitude toward VR. Findings also suggest that comprehension of microaggressions gained from engaging in a VLE is related to one’s international posture. Additional findings as well as limitations and future directions for VR research are discussed.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: virtual reality; virtual learning environment; intercultural communication; microaggressions; experimental study<br />\n","Abstract Body: Does our psychological attachment to our mobile phone lull us into falsely attributing higher credibility to our phones as news sources and persuade us to overtrust news articles read on the phone? We conducted two experiments to find out, testing two theoretical explanations derived from the CASA paradigm. Data partially supported a mood-based mechanism, suggesting that attachment to our mobile phone is associated with positive affect, which in turn contributes to positive evaluation of the article.\n","Abstract Body: How do people assign blame for phubbing, a form of ostracism caused by one person ignoring another person by using their phone? We draw on attributional theory to examine how people assign blame towards the self, the ostracizing partner, their relationship, the socio-physical context, and the phone. Two experimental studies confirm the classic attribution theory finding of blaming the situation more than the self for a negative event such as being ostracized due to phubbing, but Study 1 reveals that people blame the mobile phone for phubbing the most, even more than they blame the partner. Study 2 replicates the intensity of the phone attribution and indicates that blaming the phone for ostracism occurs when the phone is simply present but not in use, and even when the phone is not visibly present. Attributions to the phone are a causal explanation for ostracism predicts 1) beliefs that phones are addictive and 2) support for policies to regulate phone use, and suggest that one reason people believe phones are addictive is not because of their experience with their own phones but because they have been ostracized by others because of the phone.\n","Abstract Body: With people’s growing use of virtual agents and voice assistants on smartphones, researchers have noticed that mobile phones are not only acting as communication devices that connect users from different places, but also communication terminals that present different combinations of social cues. This study builds on the Computers are Social Actors paradigm and investigates the interaction effects between individual differences and the social cues of smartphones. Based on a lab experiment using a between-subjects factorial design, this study suggests that although anthropomorphic language and voice-based information did not have main effects on users’ social responses, people’s mobile media usage and intensive phone use interacted with these cues in their social responses to the smartphones. In addition, this study implies that it is the combination of social cues, individual differences, users’ perception, and communication contexts that contributes to people’s direct interactions with the smartphones.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This research designed two studies to test the convergence of mass and interpersonal media processes and their effects on YouTube. The first study conducted an experiment to examine the influence of interpersonal interactions on the enjoyment of the video. Results indicated that positive comment valence affected participants’ identification with content creator which then, affected enjoyment of the video. To investigate the effects of convergence from a macro-level perspective, the second study tracked and recorded data from 32 YouTube videos for 34 days and recorded the data of view numbers, like numbers, and comments of each video. Results indicated that the more content creators and users interact, the more likes the video gets. Whereas, user to user interactions decrease the number of likes on the video.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined media-based task-switching in a self-control failure framework to investigate its antecedents and outcomes. A 2 (Motivation: high vs. low) X 4 (Media: Twitter vs. Facebook vs. texting vs. no medium) between-subjects experiment was conducted using college student participants. A path analysis demonstrated several key findings: (1) motivation suppresses task-switching, while media trigger task-switching; (2) some media (i.e., Facebook) improve mood, but the use pattern of task-switching overall negatively affect it; (3) task-switching has no direct impact on task performance, while pleasant mood increases task performance, suggesting a mediated effect of task-switching on performance via mood. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Development in mobile technology, along with information and communication technology(ICT) has allowed users of media to become creators or social media influencers. With the rise of YouTube as a prominent platform for these new creators and influencers, the content genre of the videos shared on their YouTube channel has broadened from informational to more intimate viewing; such as vlogs, mukbang, and ASMR(Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response). Research from psychology has found that ASMR contents provide temporary psychological relief to people suffering from depression, high levels of stress, and chronic pain. Meanwhile, other research suggests a positive connection with loneliness and the amount of media usage. This study aims to examine the nature of the relationship between loneliness and perceived level of stress and the motivation of watching ASMR eliciting content videos using Mood Management theory as a research framework. By conducting a survey experiment involving 200 younger adults in their 20s residing in Korea, consisting of each gender equally, this study estimates to find the following. Results showed that motivations for viewing ASMR eliciting content video follows mood management theory and the level of loneliness was positively associated with the degree of social presence in ASMR eliciting content video. To complement the method of survey, we also used functional MRI to measure brain activities of people watching four different types of ASMR eliciting content videos. Results varies somewhat from prior studies allowing speculation that ASMR is more of a subjective feeling as opposed to an objective feeling.<br /><br />Keyword : asmr, social presence, loneliness, perceived stress, mood management theory\n","Abstract Body: Many people follow celebrities on social media; and using social media to interact with fans is often recommended as a strategy to foster the relationship with fans. People who follow celebrities on social media usually evaluate these celebrities positively. However, it is unclear whether this is mainly a selection effect (people who already like the celebrity follow it) or a media effect (following a celebrity leads to a more positive evaluation). To disentangle these processes, we conducted a two-wave panel study among a representative sample of adult German internet users. Moreover, we compared people who already followed an athlete on Facebook with people who were asked to follow one of several target athletes for the next weeks. We further explored the mediating and/or moderating role of parasocial relationships with the athlete and perceived authenticity of his/her Facebook posts. Interestingly, there was a slight decrease in evaluation from time 1 to time 2, but an indirect positive effect of exposure to posts on evaluation at time 2 via parasocial interaction. Perceived authenticity moderated these effects.\n","Abstract Body: RESEARCH PAPER – Media figures are consistently attempting to build their fandom and a classic method for this is through limiting the perceived separation between them and their viewers. Viewers can perceive these interactions as more intimate and, in turn, these viewers can develop parasocial relationships. The livestreaming platform Twitch is especially well built for developing these relationships. To test for these relationships, this study logged the chats from thousands of Twitch channels for a month. The chat logs were limited to messages which targeted users and the targeted messages were analyzed for verbal immediacy. Researchers have historically used verbal immediacy as a metric for identifying close relationships in the online space and can, therefore, be used to show perceived relational closeness with media figures. This study compared streamer-targeted messages and other-targeted messages to identify if there was a greater verbal immediacy toward streamers than other viewers. Chat logs were also divided according to stream content. Streams can consist of either gameplay or non-gameplay content. Gameplay content can be further divided between entertainment and expertise streams. The analyses found that message target was a statistically significant predictor for verbal immediacy, with streamer-targeted messages having a higher verbal immediacy than other-targeted messages, while stream content was a poor or insignificant predictor.\n","Abstract Body: This study builds on the work of Innis (1949, 1951, 2007), McLuhan (1964) and others to explore the role of time, space, and other media characteristics in the adoption of smart phone technology. The primary question is: how have digital mobile technologies changed both practice and perception of communicating across time and space? Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 digital immigrants who were over the age of 50 and who currently use a smart phone. Strong dependency on smart phones was found in the same life-spheres identified in an earlier study of adolescents who had come of age with the internet (McMillan & Morrison, 2006). Examples are offered from different segments of the typology formed by considering time, place, secular, sacred, and hot and cool media. In summary, for these informants, communication has changed. They were able to identify their first digital mobile devices. But while those devices were often life changing, they were elementary compared to their current smart phones. And now they are dependent on those tools that allow them to communicate anytime, anywhere, and with multiple modalities.\n","Abstract Body: With increased smartphone use comes increased concern about screen time, or time spent looking at a digital screen. Efforts to reduce screen time include time-tracking tools such as Apple’s new built-in Screen Time feature. This study uses an online survey (<i>N<\/i> = 405) to investigate who uses the Screen Time feature, what predicts their use of it, and whether Screen Time users spend less time on their phone than non-users. Based on Technology Acceptance Model, results indicate that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use predict positive attitudes toward the feature, intention to use it, and actual use of it. However, those who use the feature do not report spending any less time on their phones. Additionally, those who are generally more mindful find the feature to be less useful and are no more likely to use it. These findings contribute to building theory about screen time, and also offer design implications for who to target in screen time tracking tools.\n","Abstract Body: Characterized as both “hybrid media system” and “fragmented media landscape,” the contemporary communication ecology features news outlets and social media bound together yet divided along partisan lines. This study combines computational text analysis and time series modeling to examine such interrelationship. Analyses were conducted in three stages: (1) model how social media discourses and news attention concerning gun violence and gun policy are shaped by specific characteristics of mass shooting events; (2) test the causal flows between social media discourses and news attention across conservative, moderate, and progressive outlets; and (3) simulate how different parts of the hybrid media system respond to one another while accounting for event characteristics. Results reveal (a) social media discourses shape subsequent news attention even after accounting for the effects of event characteristics, and (b) conservative advocates for gun rights and conservative news attention to gun policy mainly counter the content their progressive counterparts. These results speak directly to a <i>reactive media system<\/i> in which partisan dynamics among hybrid media shape communication flows.\n","Abstract Body: This study compares whether satire is more likely to evoke user-content engagement on online platforms than regular news. User-content interactivity is one way to be engaged with media content, which is ideal from many normative theories on the functioning of the public sphere, but impossible to achieve for the mass media. Through their presence on social media channels, however, TV programs give the public the possibility to interact with their content. To test the hypotheses, a large-scale data analysis of social media posts by a variety of TV shows on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Reddit has been conducted. Results demonstrate the potential of satire to encourage more user-content interactivity. Satire videos generated more likes than those of regular news. Moreover, the satire videos evoked more comments to their posts. However, we also find that satire videos are related to <i>less<\/i> audience diversity, which might hamper the free exchange of ideas.<br />\n","Abstract Body: A 2 (author attribution: human or algorithms) X 3 (article attitudes: attitude-consistent news, attitude-challenging news, or neutral story) X 2 (article topics: gun control or abortion) mixed-design online experiment (<i>N<\/i>=351) was conducted to examine whether selective exposure will occur when people read news attributed to an algorithm author. This study experimentally manipulated the attribution of authorship for gun and abortion stories. Results reveal selective exposure and selective avoidance stay true when the authorship is purported as algorithms. For stories purportedly written by both algorithms and humans, people are more likely to select attitude-consistent news rather than attitude-challenging news; and rate attitude-consistent news stories as more credible than attitude-challenging news. Results also show, in terms of source credibility, human source is perceived as more credible than algorithms source; in terms of message credibility, human attribution news is more credible than algorithmic attribution stories, but the difference is small.\n","Abstract Body: Today, people are exposed to vast information flows when being online or on social media. This abundance has led some people to believe that they do not have to actively seek the news anymore, and that important news will find them anyways through social media or other online channels. Recently, academics have offered a first theoretical account, capturing this belief as the ‘<i>news-finds-me’ <\/i>perception (NFM). Initial studies have been conducted in the U.S., indicating deleterious effects between the NFM and both traditional news use and political behaviors. This study seeks to expand this line of research, exploring the proliferation of the NFM in 10 societies around the world. Findings give insights into the degree of the NFM proliferation in diverse contexts. Across societies, NFM perception is related to age, social media news use, and other meaningful democratic variables such as political interest, political knowledge and voting behavior.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Previous research on the role of social media on civic and political engagement has called for more research on different types of social media use and a nuanced approach to understanding the effects of social media on various forms of engagement. To fill these gaps in existing literature, this study examines how different types of social media news usage influence low- and high-effort civic and political engagement behaviors. In addition, this study examines how the use of different social media platforms (e.g., SNSs, blogs, online communities, and messengers) for news consumption impacts civic and political engagement differently. Using a survey conducted to a representative sample in South Korea (n=1,008), this study found that social media news usage is positively associated with civic and political engagement. Specifically, relational use had a positive influence on all forms of civic and political engagement. Expressive use was particularly beneficial to high-effort forms of civic engagement such as volunteering and protesting. Use of SNSs had a positive association with donation or volunteering, whereas the characteristics of user groups seemed to matter more for protesting and voting. Based on these findings, I argue that motivating people to share/comment on news or to express their thoughts on news is a key to deepening civic and political engagement beyond slacktivism. However, we also need to consider how the configurations and user characteristics of each platform facilitate or dampen the engagement process.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates the role of social media in influencing gender inequality in online political engagement across three Sub-Saharan African nations. The findings suggest that there exists a gender divide in online engagement. Furthermore, the informational use of print newspapers, online, and social media increases the likelihood of engagement, but social media use exacerbates gender-driven engagement inequality. Finally, education, as a personal cognitive factor reinforces social media effects. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Previous research demonstrates that controversy in the content of news articles influences<br />individuals’ attention, selection, and distribution of news. However, no study has examined<br />whether controversy in social media comment fields can trigger similar effects. This study,<br />using a mixed-methods approach combining eye tracking with surveys, conducts an experiment<br />in which participants (n=98) were exposed to 40 Facebook news posts from a Swedish<br />newspaper. Under each post, we manipulated a pair of comments to be in either agreement or<br />disagreement with one another. The findings demonstrate that the disagreement condition (our<br />proxy for controversy) increases users’ attention to comments and decreases their likelihood to<br />share the post. Thus, controversy in comments can cue news engagement on social media, but<br />it affects different types of engagement differently. Moreover, we find a statistically significant<br />difference between the effects of comment controversy on hard vs. soft news. Compared to soft<br />news, controversy in hard news comments reduced users’ attention to the comment field, as<br />well as their likelihood to read the Facebook post.\n","Abstract Body: Considering the popularity of Instagram Stories among young adults, this research examines why and how Millennials consume, contribute, and create content on Instagram Stories and how their engagement levels lead to positive emotions and social media dependency. First, a pretest was conducted to generate a list of motivation items for understanding the drivers behind Instagram Stories usage. Second, a sample of 296 U.S. Millennials was surveyed to investigate users’ motivations for using Instagram Stories as well as how the different uses influence psychological outcomes. The findings suggest that eight types of motivations emerged from the data: variety-seeking, self-enhancement, entertainment, functionality, expression, interaction, novelty, and surveillance. Specifically, entertainment and functionality are related to consumption of Instagram Stories, expression and interaction are associated with both contribution and creation on it, and self-enhancement and novelty are linked to Instagram Stories creation. The findings further suggest that the more users engage with Instagram Stories, the more dependent they become through increased positive emotions. Implications and limitations of this research are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: In today’s increasingly connected digital era, social media has become an integral component for individuals in conducting daily activities and building social networks. Guided by Uses and Gratification Theory (UGT) and Homophily Theory, this study aims to explore (1) the change of the purposes of using social media (i.e., socializing, obtaining information, gaining insight into oneself or others, reinforcing identity, obtaining support, entertainment, emotional release) and the change of homogenous ties (i.e., family and friends, people who shared interests) over the past ten years (2008-2018), (2) the effect of different purposes of using social media on individuals’ homogeneous networks. Based on a longitudinal survey data (2008-2018 Digital Future Survey), results reveal the trend of purposes of using social media and the change of individual homogeneous social networks. In addition, results show that after controlling for demographic variables and Internet use variables, all the purposes were positively associated with the connection with family and friends. Similarly, socializing, obtaining information, gaining insight into oneself or others, reinforcing identity, obtaining support, and entertainment were positively associated with the connection with people who shared interests. However, emotional release was not associated with the connection with people who shared interests. This study provides implications for how the various uses of social media may influence individuals’ different types of homogeneous ties.\n",null,"Abstract Body: People turn to others to gain knowledge about themselves. Other humans serve as reference points with which one compares oneself. As opposed to offline environments, on social media, people are exposed to an extensive network of reference points. Individual pieces of information of general others' behaviors on social media often accumulate into a solid perception of behavioral norms, and in turn, exert influences on the users' behaviors. Based on this premise, this study aimed to explain how exposure to upward comparison targets on social media is translated into descriptive norms and thus influence the users' behaviors. Also, we proposed that an individual's differences in self-improvement motive might moderate this process. An experimental study in the context of environment-friendly behaviors showed that social comparison motives moderate the relationship between upward social comparison and the perception of descriptive norms. The descriptive norms, in turn, affected participants' intention to engage in environment-friendly behaviors.\n","Abstract Body: The unique possibilities for action through novel digitally-mediated contexts begs consideration of the ways in which technology users can optimize their memory strategies to become effective cognitive agents in a digital world. We start from the position that the process of searching for information via online search bars (e.g., Amazon search) requires considerable cognitive planning that employ several processes for effective learning (e.g., deep processing, cognitive elaboration). Generating search queries, under these conditions, set the stage for excellent memory for the searched content. This experiment examines whether generating search queries to find products influence recognition of the brand produced by the search result. Brands shown to individuals after generating a search query were better recognized than brands shown without generating a search query. This finding supports the idea that there are cognitive benefits to information retrieval via internet search.\n","Abstract Body: We investigated the association between Internet access and citizens’ voicing their opinions to public officials and how age and national economy affect this association in the theoretical framework of civic engagement. Survey data collected from representative samples of residents of 126 countries were analyzed for the investigation (<i>N<\/i> = 226,716). The results of the generalized linear mixed models analyses show that Internet access is positively associated with voicing opinions to public officials and that age and national economy moderated the association. These results suggest that those who are older and those in comparatively less developed countries are more likely to become socially engaged once they have access to the Internet compared to those who are younger and those in developed countries. Implications of the findings and limitations of the study are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Political expression on social network sites (SNSs) can be affected by the personal relationship between SNS users. Following the situational perspective of spiral of silence (SOS) and drawing upon perceived audience costs, the present study examines how the relationship between SNS users and the perceived incongruence between their opinions may influence their political expression. Results of a 2 (Facebook contact: close friend vs. coworker) * 2 (opinion incongruence: low vs. high) * 2 (issue: government surveillance on individuals vs. immigration) between-subjects experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 453) reveal that coworkers were perceived to cause more social and economic loss than close friends only when individuals had different opinions, which motivated them to engage in more strategic political expression. This study extends SOS by explicating how individuals appraise costs of political expression, and suggests the role that SNSs play in political deliberation.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Social media afford users to share and discuss news. Some users would be concerned about how others view these expressive behaviors; social recommendation features of social media indeed offer cues about other's opinions which serves as possible references for these users to engage with news. Using representative online survey data of six countries (Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia), we investigate the mediating role of reliance on two recommendation features, i.e., social filtering and popularity indicators, for news selection in the relationship between concern over online expression and social media news engagement. Findings across the samples illustrated that the direct effect is either negative or non-significant. However, positive indirect effect through reliance on social filtering is observed across all the samples. Similarly, positive indirect effect through reliance on popularity indicators is observed for five of the six samples. Implications of the findings are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Cyberbullying often happens in the presence of bystanders. To examine the factors influencing cyberbystander likelihood of intervening in cyberbullying on social media, a 2 (degree of cyberbullying severity: high vs. low) × 2 (level of interpersonal similarity: high vs. low) between-subjects experiment was conducted (<i>N<\/i> = 132). Results indicated that cyberbystanders’ perceived responsibility for helping and empathic responses depended on the severity of cyberbullying. The more responsibility and empathy bystanders felt, the more likely they were to publicly and privately intervene. Moreover, the indirect effect of cyberbullying severity on willingness to intervene through empathy was more pronounced when the interpersonal similarity between victim and cyberbystander was low, rather than it was high.\n","Abstract Body: The mounting concern on the consequences of incivility on deliberative democracy is borne out of the possibility that incivility silences individuals and prevents them from meaningfully participating in the public discourse arena. Thus, culling from the fundamental assertions of deliberative democracy and the Spiral of Silence (SOS) Theory and integrating the concept of civility and incivility in public discourse, this study examines how online exposure to civil or uncivil expression of issue support or dissent consequently affect online opinion articulation or concealment. Data from a fully-online and fully-offsite experiment, which simulated an online reader comments setting, was tested to trace possible causal connections. Findings suggest a paradox of civility – that while civility largely enables participation, civility may not sufficiently disinhibit individuals from extending their participation when dissenting opinions are being discussed. Furthermore, findings seem to reveal a paradox of incivility – that while incivility does not prompt everyone to engage online, neither does it predestine silence as uncivil disagreements may actually prod individuals to speak online. Since the paradoxes appear to operate in conjunction with the polarity of the issue position being deliberated, there should then be a more nuanced understanding of the probable consequences of civility and incivility when either supportive or dissenting issues are being deliberated.\n","Abstract Body: The phenomenon of online hostility – an umbrella term referring to concepts such as incivility, cyberbullying, and hate speech – has been studied by scholars working in a variety of fields over the past two decades. This article offers a comprehensive overview of how these concepts have been defined and measured, highlighting inconsistencies among definitions and measures of the same concept as well as overlaps among definitions and measures of different concepts. We also categorize the challenges facing researchers and practitioners seeking to identify online hostility into three distinct groups: those relating to context, those relating to format, and those relating to philosophical differences regarding the regulation of online speech. We conclude with several practical measures by which the aforementioned challenges may be addressed.\n","Abstract Body: In addition to providing an easy way for people to create and maintain their social network, and express their views and emotions, the pervasive use of social media has also become a hotbed for aggressive behaviors like cyberbullying and subtweeting. Unlike cyberbullying, subtweeting involves aggressive communication about a victim who is not explicitly identified. Subtweeting is associated with negative effects on victims and perpetrators just like traditional forms of cyberbullying, yet this phenomenon has not been adequately examined. Using a between-subject experimental design, the current study explored the effects of post directness (direct vs. indirect) and comment agreeableness (agree vs. disagree vs. both agree and disagree) on bystanders’ perceptions of aggressive posts, sympathy and likability toward both victims and perpetrators, and bystander intervention intentions. Results indicated that post directness has a main effect on bystanders’ perceived appropriateness of the aggressive posts and their likeability of perpetrators, but no significant effect on their sympathy toward victims nor intentions to intervene. Comment agreeableness did not significantly affect any of the outcome variables. The interaction between post directness and comment agreeableness also did not significantly affect any of the outcome variables. Findings are discussed in relation to potential conformity with social norms and the bystander effect.\n","Abstract Body: Around the world, people increasingly generate data through their everyday activities.<br />Much of this also happens unwittingly, thanks to sensors, cameras, and other surveillance tools<br />on the roads, in cities, and in businesses. However, the ways citizens and governments think<br />about privacy vary significantly around the world. In this paper, we explore differences between<br />citizens’ attitudes toward privacy and data collection practices in the U.S. and the Netherlands,<br />an EU member nation. Using a factorial vignette survey methodology, we identify specific<br />contextual factors associated with people’s level of concern about how their data is being used.<br />We consider the role that five factors play in this assessment: actors (those using data), data type<br />and amount, reported purpose for data use, and inferences drawn from the data. These indicate<br />nationally bound differences but likewise, point to potentially more globally shared concerns.\n","Abstract Body: The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) introduced in 2018 in the EU aims to give consumers a high degree of control over their data online in order to allow them to protect their privacy. It also puts high transparency requirements for websites that collect and process data. In fact, consumers have to be informed about technical and legal aspects of data collection; this knowledge should empower them to consciously give or withdraw their consent for data collection. The current study investigates the empowering impact of technical and legal knowledge about online data collection within the theoretical framework of the Protection Motivation Theory, the Regulatory Focus Theory, and contextual integrity. An online experiment in which participants are exposed to a technical or legal knowledge intervention in either commercial or news website context shows that receiving both kinds of information leads to lower threat appraisal. At the same time, having legal knowledge empowers consumers: it positively impacts their coping appraisal and motivation to reject online data collection. The study findings raise questions about the current transparency requirements about data collection and highlight the importance of legal knowledge as well as law enforcement for online privacy protection of consumers.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Numerous digital media technology companies incentivize consumers to share personal information in exchange for access to services, personalization or access to information. While common, consumers have good reasons to perceive such information sharing as risky, which may influence their disclosure behavior. The current study investigates key factors influencing and explaining digital media technology users’ voluntary disclosure of information, with particular focus on the construct on trust. The Interdisciplinary Trust Model (ITM) is applied as the main theoretical framework and is extended by three factors central to the digital media context, namely risk perceptions of data sharing online, privacy concern and previous privacy violation experience. Results from a cross-sectional survey with a sample of 420 U.S. adults demonstrate that institutional trust in structural assurance of digital media technology is the main predictor of personal information sharing. At the same time, other trust-related constructs and risk perceptions do not relate to information sharing. Also, trust is shown to be an experience-driven construct. The central role of institutional trust found in the study is discussed from the perspective of monopoly and power of digital media technology companies, which lets us conclude substantial societal implication. Also, the findings suggest a need to revise the ITM to make it applicable to the digital media environment.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study examined the effects of the counter-rumor on changes in belief about the anti-vaccination claim, anxiety associated with the rumor, intentions to vaccinate a child and share the rumor. We also tested whether the recipient’s attitude toward vaccination could affect these outcomes. An online experiment with a 2 (argument strength: strong vs. weak) x 2 (expertise source: high vs. low) between-subjects factor experimental design was conducted (N = 400). This study provides evidence that attitude toward mandatory vaccination and source expertise had an impact on the reduction in the anti-vaccination belief, and particularly, cue-message congruency (i.e., strong argument and high expertise source) plays a crucial role in increasing the effectiveness of the counter-rumor. Implications of the findings are discussed in light of online rumor research and strategies to reduce the impact of health misinformation.\n","Abstract Body: The widespread popularity of social media influencers (SMIs) has prompted a resurgence of scholarly interest in opinion leadership on social media. Guided by the social identity theory of leadership and using the contentious issue of nuclear energy development, this study serves as the first empirical assessment of SMIs’ attitudinal and behavioral influences on YouTube. In total, 251 Singapore citizens and permanent residents from an online survey panel participated in this 3 (Attitude similarity: Similar vs. mixed vs. dissimilar) x 2 (Social group status: Ordinary YouTube user vs. SMI) between-subjects factorial experiment. Attitude similarity predicted participants’ attitudes toward the YouTube video, their attitude strength toward nuclear energy development, and their willingness to share the YouTube video. Attitude similarity also interacted with social group status to influence participants’ willingness to share the YouTube video. Theoretical and practical implications, as well as directions for future research were discussed.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study examines the complexities of context, where continuous flows of information about social ties entail both positive and negative effects on one’s perception of social justice. To generate a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, I specifically focus on one’s knowledge about other network members’ lives and relate it to use of communication technologies and belief in a just world. Drawing upon a national sample of Adult Americans, I found the use of these technologies was indirectly associated with one’s belief in a just world through heightened awareness of major life events occurring to others. More specifically, the use of some technologies, such as mobile messages and Facebook is associated with higher awareness of undesirable life events in the lives of others. This increased awareness is related to lower levels of belief in a just world. However, this negative relationship is not uniform but varies depending on the relationship an individual has with the people who experienced the undesirable life events (strong ties vs. weak ties) and the target of people for justice (the self vs the other people). Altogether, these findings suggest that users of technology experience different social strains depending on with whom they communicate what information through which technology\n","Abstract Body: The increasing depth and availability of digital trace data have enabled new forms of message personalization, such as providing social media advertisements tailored to psychographic profiles. An experiment (<i>N<\/i>=937) investigated the conditions under which trait-based personalized messages in social media are more persuasive than non-personalized messages and which personality traits and user characteristics are most suitable for this purpose. Participants’ Big Five personality traits, need for cognition, and their susceptibility to persuasive strategies were assessed in a questionnaire, while the persuasive appeal was varied as a between-subject factor. Results showed limited effects of matching: Matched ads led to persuasive advantages concerning intentions to engage with the post in social media when they addressed specific persuasive susceptibilities (particularly toward authority influence). However, there were no consistent effects on consumers’ attitudes toward the advertised products. Findings are discussed with regard to the ongoing debate on hidden persuasion and microtargeting in social media.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Social bots have become a key issue in online communication during election campaigns because they potentially mislead citizens and hinder them to form a public opinion on political candidates and issues. We explain why Twitter provides a fertile habitat for social bots but also why this led to unintended consequences from the perspective of affordance theory. Based on a three-week data set representing all retweets including a political candidate during the 2019 Australian election campaign, we analysed 99,171 unique Twitter accounts, conducted a quantitative profile analysis, and use structural topic modeling to detect which of the 24 detected topics were affected by parties and social bots. Although the Liberals’ campaign tweets were the most artificially amplified (both positively and negatively), the results show that almost no social bots could be detected and that they only marginally increased the visibility of two right-wing parties.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study investigates how online dating profiles, consisting of picture and text, are visually processed, and how cues in both components affect impression formation. The attractiveness of the profile picture was varied systematically, and texts included language errors or not. By collecting eye tracking and perception data, we investigated whether picture attractiveness determines attention to the profile text and that the text plays a secondary role. Eye tracking results revealed that pictures are more likely to attract initial attention and that more attractive pictures receive more attention. Texts received attention regardless of picture attractiveness. Moreover, perception data showed that both the pictorial and textual cues affected impression formation, but that they affect different dimensions of perceived attraction differently. Based on our results, a new multimodal information processing model is proposed, which suggests that pictures and text are processed independently and lead to separate assessments of cue attractiveness before impression formation.\n","Abstract Body: The first face-to-face (FtF) meeting of online daters serves as a turning point for relationship development. Based on expectancy violations theory (EVT), this study investigated the effects of expectancy violations on partners’ physical attractiveness on four relational outcomes (i.e., satisfaction of the first meeting, liking of the partner, anticipated future interaction, and overall impression of partners) during modality switching. Using a survey with 131 online daters who have met their online partners face-to-face in the previous three months, this study found, in line with EVT, negative expectancy violations in the first FtF meeting were associated with undesirable relational outcomes. Furthermore, the perceived honesty of partners partially mediated the associations between negative expectancy violations on partners’ physical attractiveness and relational outcomes. Moderating effects of two variables (i.e., relational goals and commitment prior to the first meeting) were also investigated and discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Mobile dating apps like Tinder became very popular among young adults and in contrast to mobile dating websites they offer unique technical design features such as a very game-like character. One core motivation to use these apps is entertainment (Timmermans & De Caluwé, 2017a), which received less attention in research on mobile dating apps. However, referring to research on entertainment and computer science, these specific features could be the reasons why such apps are that successful. To examine how the specific technical design features and the behaviors they allow for (e.g., liking a lot of persons in a short period of time and increasing the chance of a match and conversation) induce entertainment and which influence peers have on using dating apps we have employed a qualitative multi-phase explanatory approach. First, we conducted 20 interviews with mobile dating app users. Based on the findings from that study, we conducted gender-specific focus groups and a discourse analysis to explore the social phenomena identified in phase one. Our findings suggest that the social aspects of collective use of dating apps are a key driver in the motivation to “play” and enhance the apps’ hedonic value. Unsurprisingly, notions of “play” across the interview, focus group, and discourse analyses reflect highly gendered behaviors regarding mobile dating apps. <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />\n","Abstract Body: From conveying intimacy (“I like you”) to irritation (“stop messaging me!”) and dissatisfaction (“I don’t think we’ll work out”), language use plays a fundamental yet often overlooked role in the initiation of romantic relationships. In online dating, daters exchange messages in order to determine how romantically interested they are in a potential partner and whether they wish to go on a first date with them. In two studies, we examined how linguistic features present in online dating messages during the discovery phase can be used to predict whether a first date with the potential partner occurred. In Study 1, we took an exploratory approach, identifying six broad language categories that could be used to predict first date outcomes: message length, confidence, positive emotion, negative emotion, decision making, and logistics. In Study 2, we tested our hypotheses generated from Study 1 on a new dataset. Our results suggest that the broad linguistic categories within online dating messages during the discovery phase can be used to predict above chance the likelihood of going on a first date with an online dating partner.\n","Abstract Body: Perceptions of physical burdens, including geographical slants, may be affected by individuals’ psychological resources such as social support. In original research, Schnall, Harber, Stefanucci, and Proffitt (2008) found that social support can be primed through physical co-presence and imagining supportive others. Given the theoretical and practical importance of both social support and perceptions of physical burden, the present research replicated and extended the research in the context of mediated communication. In a 2 (social support: high vs. low) x 2 (priming type: virtual vs. physical) between-subject quasi-experiment, data from 174 participants revealed that those with greater levels of social support judged a hill to be less steep than those with lower levels of social support. In addition, participants who texted a friend reported lower slant estimation than those who were co-present with a friend. This effect was partially mediated by relationship duration – people in the texting condition selected longer-term relational partners than partners available in the physical condition. This research demonstrates that social support, when primed through text messaging, can influence visual perception, and can be more powerful than in-person support.\n","Abstract Body: This paper analyses if push notifications of social network sites (SNS) to users lead to triggered escapism on the example of Facebook push notifications. Facebook push notifications are conceptualized as starting point of a chain of persuasive offerings that result in Facebook triggered escapism. A push notification is successful, i.e. has high persuasiveness when addressed users react on it, enter the platform and stay longer in Facebook. Thus, through reacting on push notifications users get immersed into Facebook’s entertainment and media offerings, which results in a triggered escapist consumption of the offered content by the platform. The empirical results reveal that self-control is negatively related to triggered Facebook escapism. Usability of push Facebook notifications is positively related to triggered Facebook escapism. Triggered Facebook escapism furthermore results in positive effects for users in term of enjoyment, autonomy, competence and relatedness. It is negatively related to feeling of guilt.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates how undergraduates choose between texting and face-to-face interaction to communicate in a romantic relationship, as a function of situational, personal, and media factors. In an experimental design, participants imagined being in either the initiator or recipient role in a series of hypothetical conversations varying in interpersonal threats (mundane talk, difficult conversations, breakup), within an exclusive 6-month romantic relationship. Results show that more threatening conversations caused participants to have a higher interest in face-to-face interaction and a lower interest in texting. The more socially anxious participants were, the more they were interested in texting for episodes involving threats. When facing breakups, the initiator had a higher interest in texting than the recipient. The positive relationship between social anxiety and interest in texting was mediated by participants’ perceived importance of media affordances (i.e., bandwidth and editability) under threatening situations. These findings extend O’Sullivan’s impression management model of communication channels.<br />\n","Abstract Body: As chatbots are social and interactive technologies, they might be effective tools to lower the threshold of engaging with news content containing opposing views. In an experiment, we test this by investigating whether people are more likely to accept a news article containing conflicting views when it is delivered by a chatbot. The results indicated that people agreed more to a counter-attitudinal news article when it was delivered by a news chatbot (compared to a website article). In addition, users also perceived this chatbot article as more credible. As an underlying mechanism, we found that the chatbot was being attributed social and human-like characteristics on an implicit level (mindless anthropomorphism), and because of these social cues, the chatbot swayed users to agree more with a counter-attitudinal news story. These results are discussed in the light of their contribution to an informed public discourse and depolarization in our society.\n","Abstract Body: Although the third-person effect (TPE) has been widely supported in the context of traditional media and social media, few studies have applied TPE in the context of social bots. Using survey data with 406 undergraduate students, the current study tests both the perceptual and behavioral third-person effect on social bots on Twitter. In specific, the study aims at investigating 1) if individuals tend to underestimate social bots effects on themselves and overestimate that on others; 2) if perceptual TPE leads to a behavioral outcome which is corrective actions 3) if people's perception on social bots and self-efficacy trigger perceptual and behavioral TPE, respectively.<br /><br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: Third-person effect, social bots, self-efficacy\n","Abstract Body: This study aims to examine how chatbots should communicate to improve emotional well-being among people who are experiencing stressful events. Bridging interpersonal and human-computer communication theories, the study investigated the effects of an individual’s self-disclosure to a chatbot or a human, receiving emotional support and reciprocal self-disclosure from a chatbot or a human on reducing the individual’s worry and perceived stress. In a 2 by 2 by 2 between-subject online experiment, participants engaged in a conversation with a chat partner talking about their stressful experiences and feelings. The results showed several significant interaction effects between the source of communication (i.e., chatbot or human), provision of emotional support and reciprocal self-disclosure from the chat partner on stress and worry reduction. Moreover, a moderated mediation analysis revealed that the source moderated the association between provision of emotional support and perceived emotional support, which in turn, lead to reduced stress and worry among participants.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Regret experiences that follow from sharing content on different social media platforms can impact an individual’s well-being. One important and omnipresent type of content on social media that is related to feelings of regret is alcohol-related content. This study investigated the causes and coping strategies of regret of sharing alcohol-related content on social media. Semi-structured interviews were conducted among emerging adults who experienced this type of regret (n= 29, age 19-25, <i>M=<\/i> 21.38, <i>SD<\/i>= 1.60). Our results showed different causes of regret, depending on the type of alcohol-related content that is shared on social media. Participants distinguished between ‘inappropriate’ drunken content and ‘moderate’ alcohol-references. The most important cause of regret for both drunken content and alcohol-references is a disruption of one’s online self-presentation. Specifically for drunken content, three other causes of regret could be identified, that is (1) disinhibition and inappropriate content, (2), unwanted audience and (3) peer disapproval. Two types of coping strategies could be identified to deal with online alcohol-related regret experiences, i.e., long-term and short-term strategies. Implications for prevention are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Parental sharing of child-related content on social network sites, termed “sharenting”, is often the target of criticism. Yet, through sharenting, parents can find support systems, a way to stay in touch with relevant others, and even an opportunity for additional income. This study contributes to knowledge on the privacy-related aspects of sharenting. It explores the impact of parents’ privacy concerns on the sharing of child-related content, as well as on the sharing of content about themselves. In this study, we differentiate between institutional privacy, social privacy, and situational privacy. Moreover, we investigate whether parents’ privacy self-efficacy and the support of their peers influence parental sharing practices. Drawing on a rich body of privacy literature, we discuss the results of an online survey distributed among 640 Instagram users with children younger than 13 years old and residing in either Italy or the UK. We find that situational privacy concerns, unlike institutional or social concerns, are negatively related to parents’ sharenting behavior. Additionally, a network which is supportive of parental sharenting positively predicts sharenting across both countries. Parents with more followers are also more likely to share content about children. Consistent with the situational view of privacy, our findings suggest that context-specific privacy considerations play a more substantial role in shaping parents’ sharing behavior than general privacy attitudes.\n","Abstract Body: Self-presentation, the process by which people disclose information about themselves to others, is fundamental to online interaction and research on communication technology. Technology often mediates the self-presentation process by obscuring who is in the audience via constrained cues and opaque feed algorithms that govern the visibility of social media content. This can make it risky to disclose sensitive or potentially stigmatizing information about oneself, because it could fall into the wrong hands or be seen by an unsupportive audience. Still, there are times when it is socially beneficial to disclose sensitive information, such as LGBTQ+ people expressing their identities or disclosing HIV status. Decisions about sensitive disclosure, moreover, can be even more complicated in today’s social media landscape with many platforms and audiences in play, particularly for younger users who often use many platforms. We lack a good understanding, however, of how people make these decisions. This paper addresses questions about sensitive disclosure on social media through a survey study of adolescent men who have sex with men and their willingness to disclose on social media the use of PrEP, an HIV prevention medication. Results suggest that perceived platform audience composition and platform features such as ephemerality play into disclosure decisions, as well as the perceived normativity of PrEP use among peers.\n",null,"Abstracts: Credit record is often used to measure the level of trustworthiness in in lending practices. Yet, the power of credit scores is not limited to determining the availability of loan services, and the scoring processes are not only based on monetary activities. China started its grand project of \"\"Constructing Credit Cities\"\" in the early 2000s. In two decades, honesty and creditworthiness has been promoted as a set of moral standards and translated into a variety of credit-score-based metrics that the citizens have to abide by. How have these scores been established and applied for social governance? Through a case study of the government-led project, \"\"Constructing Credit Shanghai\"\" that took place between 2003 and 2018, this paper identifies the socio-technical forces that enable the power of credit-based governing, which I call credit authority. Drawing on the idea of abstractization of value, this project broadens our view on the social and political meanings of credits.\n","Abstracts: China’s Social Credit System (SCS) has regularly been portrayed in Western media as a horrific episode of authoritarian surveillance dystopia. Yet the SCS also seems to enjoy the popular support of Chinese consumers and citizens based on recent surveys (Kostka, 2019). The emerging work on the SCS, I argue, has been largely disconnected from its historical antecedents in China. While some studies have made passing reference to the Dang’an system (or personnel dossiers) used by the Chinese Communist Party’s organizational department that lasts till this day (e.g. Creemers, 2018), no work has explicitly linked the current SCS to its counterparts during imperial and modern times, thus depriving the public a deeper understanding of the historical lineage of the SCS and possible explanations of the Chinese populace’s support for it.\n","Abstracts: The rise of digital technology allows state power to build constant and ubiquitous systems for citizen classification. This article examines China’s personal credit scoring platforms behind the Social Credit System. By analyzing credit systems in 25 cities, this research finds that local governments have the capacity to score and rank citizens based on tremendous amounts of data. The personal scores usually range from 0-200 or 0-1,000, including an increase-decrease system. Citizens are automatically classified into different groups (e.g., AAA, A+ or D) according to their credit scores. While those who have higher scores can receive various rewards, people with lower scores are restricted from accessing some public services. Moreover, good behaviors (i.e., earning scores) mainly focus on moral models, whilst bad behaviors (i.e., losing scores) contain social management, financial activities and law enforcements. Overall, these platforms enable the automated classification and scrutiny of citizens on a continuous and real-time basis.\n","Abstract Body: The rise of digital nationalism has been gaining wide scholarly attention. In particular, scholars believe that social networking sites (SNSs) breed nationalistic sentiments and provide ample ground for anti-Japanese activities in China. However, few researchers have explored the underlying mechanism of online communication and the Chinese public’s image of Japan. Accordingly, the primary purpose of this study was to explore the underlying mechanism of SNS communication and the image of Japan in the eyes of the Chinese college students by identifying the effects of receiving and expressing Japan-related information. This study advances a theoretical reception and expression effects model centered on the bidirectional message effects model and communication mediation framework to explain the separate pathways through which obtaining and sharing information relating to Japan may influence individuals to adopt different forms of behaviors toward Japan. An emphasis on the importance of expression in the public domain makes this substantially different from previous research. The proposed model was tested with data from a survey of 473 Chinese undergraduates in Beijing. Relying on communication effect theories, and contrary to existing literature, this article argues that receiving information relating to Japan via SNS is constructive in enhancing the positive image of Japan, and thereby, improving Sino-Japanese relations at an individual level. At the same time, the study findings indicate that message expression can clearly be linked to wary and watchful intentions toward Japan. Implications for the role cognitive characteristics play in SNS communication will also be discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Social endorsement cues (SECs) which offer information about how social media users engage and evaluate online news content can serve as important heuristics for evaluating the credibility of information. At the same time, these cues can increasingly be manipulated by a variety of commercial and political actors on social media, presenting the possibility that the said influence of SECs can be significantly limited. This study examines (a) how SECs on social media can impact the perceived credibility of news information, and (b) whether individuals’ concerns about SEC manipulation moderate this effect. Using an online experiment, we found that (a) SECs had a negative impact on perceived news credibility, and (b) such impact of SECs did not vary depending on whether or not manipulability concerns were raised. However, manipulability concerns had an independent impact on credibility evaluation; they reduced the perceived credibility of news information regardless of SECs. This raises the possibility that concerns over manipulation of SECs can create doubt about the authenticity of other cues of the information (e.g., source, message), thereby diminishing trust in any information people encounter on social media.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores the political expressions by Facebook users in the 2017 Hong Kong Chief Executive election in relation to different message frames and formats, and offline world power structure with a new methodology. By integrating a big data analysis and traditional content study method, this study examined 534 posts and 379,880 audience comments on three candidates’ Facebook pages within the election period. Based on the literature of normalization and innovation hypotheses, message strategies and social media, the paper is among the first studies to examine both affective responses and cognitive expressions of social media users regarding the use of different content strategies by politicians in election campaigns with the offline power structure taken into account. The data analysis provides evidence that dominant candidate takes advantage in portraying their online images, which generate more and longer comments thus yielding more favorable results. While media frames do not have any impact on either affective response or quality of the comments, the use of video and photos elicits better responses. The findings contribute to the literature about online engagement and campaigning strategy. It also provides evidence to support the argument that social media may indeed replicate the offline power struggle and political responses. The implication of the findings and limitations were discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Supervision has tremendous impacts on PhD students’ wellbeing. This study is one of the first to examine of use of Weibo for discussing PhD experience and problems, through a content analysis of 802 anonymous posts and 7,543 related comments in a super-hashtag page. The result delineated the emotional states in the posts, ten supervisor-related problem topics. Moreover, the pattern of the relationship between social support seeking and receiving in posts and comments was depicted.\n","Abstract Body: Based on previous studies examining social media’s role in college student life, we predicted that Facebook can serve as a significant source for social support when students are motivated to seek social relationships on this media platform. An online survey among 282 college students was conducted and regression-based path models were applied to test a mediational model for social support on Facebook. The results indicated that computer-mediated communication competence was related to interpersonal motives to use Facebook, which were related to well-being, but only when mediated by perceived available social support. The results of this study have significant implications on designing communication interventions to help college students garner greater social support to improve health.\n","Abstract Body: Social networking sites (SNSs) present both opportunities and challenges for support exchange. This study examined 1) how support seekers can effectively elicit support on SNSs and 2) if they perceive a textual comment and one-click feedback (e.g., Like) differently on supportiveness. Participant were instructed to log onto a SNS that they frequently visited and to identify the most recent post that they broadcasted to others for emotional support. After copying and pasting their support-seeking posts to the survey, each participant answered questions on feedback received on the support-seeking post, usage of SNSs, and demographic information. Our results showed that mixed-valenced support-seeking posts received more comments than posts that only contained negative elements. In addition, posts that involved direct requests for support were more successful in eliciting comments than posts that did not. Further, support seekers in general perceived textual comments more supportive than one-click feedback.\n","Abstract Body: Numerous organizations work to provide humanitarian aid to undocumented migrants along the US-Mexico border—from running shelters in Mexico to placing water on migratory trails. There is resistance to information-sharing between organizations (and to the public), especially through technologically mediated means. However, some organizers and volunteers work across organizational boundaries and share information informally. Information secrecy is often justified by concerns that Border Patrol agents or anti-immigration activists might gain access to information, allowing them to harm or detain migrants or interfere with humanitarian work. Information politics manifest here in the choices made about the collection and (non)disclosure of information and the use or non-use of information and communication technologies (ICTs).\n","Abstract Body: Whereas accumulated research has shown the positive impact of 360-degree video on user experience, its persuasive potentials have not been fully investigated. A lab experiment compared pro-environmental 360-degree videos and uni-directional videos in their persuasive effectiveness (N = 76). Self-efficacy in pro-environmental behavior has been proposed as a moderator based on social cognitive theory and interactivity literature. We found that participants with higher self-efficacy in protecting the environment perceived that the same video content as more fun and credible in the presence of the 360-degree feature. As a result, higher self-efficacy individuals displayed higher behavioral intentions to protect the environment after interacting with the 360-degree videos.\n","Abstract Body: Most messages on social media platforms are reportedly posted by a small number of active communicators, while the great majority of users remain idle as lurkers who read but seldom write. Despite extensive research to date, it remains unclear why such a disparity in individuals’ voluntary participation exists. Drawing on the behavioral data of Facebook users nested in diverse local networks, this study attempted to examine how the structural properties of networks influence the highly skewed distribution of message contributions between individual users. Multilevel statistical analyses of 73 egocentric networks (N = 15,633) reveal that the disparity in voluntary social media communication is a collective outcome that is conditional on path-dependent structural processes in which final outcomes are contingent on prior outcomes over time.\n","Abstract Body: Social norms are powerful determinants of human behaviors, particularly in novel situations. This extends to online behaviors, such as disclosure of personal information, as shown by prior research on social norm perceptions and self-disclosure on social network sites (SNS). While observed behaviors is a starting point in the normative process of social influence, the role of prevalent behaviors on norm perceptions and subsequent self-disclosure on SNS remains unclear. To study the observed behaviors-norms-behavioral effects link, we conducted three preregistered, consecutive studies of visual disclosure using a realistic social media simulation. We further investigated potential buffering effects of critical media literacy and a privacy nudge in the normative influence process. The results demonstrate that the number of posts showing other users on the site positively affected participants’ norm perceptions and, in turn, their own visual disclosure behavior. Critical media literacy was negatively related to disclosure intentions, but not behaviors, and moderated the norm effect on visual disclosure intentions. The privacy nudge, however, did not affect visual disclosure behavior.\n","Abstract Body: This study aimed to explore the motivations and reasons for older adults to disconnect from a range of ICTs digital media, which they use to stay in contact with their social environment. Drawing on interviews with 57 older adults aged 59 and over from three European countries, our study shows that ICT disconnection from digital communication methods (e.g., email, SMS), instant messaging, video and voice calling applications, and social media platforms is widespread among this group. While disconnection from computers, smartphones, and tablets was less common, important life changes like retirement could sometimes prompt older adults to abandon computers. Different reasons explain why older adults disconnect, including personal preferences and experiences (e.g., lack of interest, replacement by alternatives, privacy concerns, information overload), as well as external factors (e.g., ICT use of family and friends, time constraints), that can be situated in their everyday life context. Overall, older adults make – depending on their personal needs and preferences – their own deliberate choices about which technologies to disconnect from versus continue to use. This study contributes to the body of literature on people’s lived experiences of ICT disconnection, an area of research that has so far largely ignores this particular age group.\n","Abstract Body: Communication as a growing academic field has attracted a large amount of attention and its interdisciplinary nature contribute a diverse communication community. This paper aims to explore the collaboration patterns, the interaction signatures between communication scholars within the community, as seen through a co-authorship network. The central question guiding this research is to see if the network centralities of individual researchers correlate with their research performance measured by h-index, g-index, and m-index. By investigating its network structure, degree and centrality distributions, I found that network centralities have the potential to serve as an indicator of research performance. Results demonstrate that co-authorship network analysis illuminates our understanding of the internal interactions within the communication scholars community and its impact on performance.\n","Abstract Body: Digital memes give social scientists valuable resources to study textual and visual data available on social media and helps augment theories in multiple fields of study such as Internet culture, computer-mediated communication (CMC), human-computer interaction (HCI) and online communities. As a prime venue where people create, modify, share and comment on different image macros, the r/dankmemes subreddit on the social curation site Reddit is used in the study to explore how content features of image memes are related to people’s participatory patterns in terms of creation and discussion. Unlike most existing studies which heavily depend on qualitative methods, this study draws a link between social science, statistics and computational science and takes advantage of modern computing techniques to examine image memes at scale. The study finds that the usage of offensive/vulgar languages in memes’ captions are not related to the choice of photo or cartoon image templates. The study also finds that memes’ categories are associated with number of comments, comment reciprocity, engagement of influential users and the usage of uncivil languages. A Random Forest model was built, which found that post creators’ influence and colorfulness of image memes are more important than other more concrete categorical information generalized from their linguistic and visual features.\n","Abstract Body: On December 3, 2018, Tumblr announced that it would ban adult content from the platform by the end of the year. Once hailed as a site that welcomed sexually explicit material, Tumblr’s policy reversal drew widespread backlash from users, inciting community efforts to thwart the ban’s enactment. Viewing this policy as censorship, this study examines how the Tumblr community resisted the ban leading up to its implementation. This study employs the lens of platform governance, in which the site is regarded as a governing body that wields power over its userbase and, as a result, has implications for users’ rights. Using critical discourse analysis and thematic analysis, this study analyzes 238 Tumblr posts responding to the ban’s announcement. Amidst more traditional forms of protest, like boycotts and petitions, users also leveraged memes and text posts to criticize and satirize censorship. Across these posts, three major themes emerged: the incompetence of platform management, restrictions on sexuality and the body, and the self-inflicted demise of the platform. Together, these modes of resistance illustrate the unique ways online communities respond to censorship, even if these efforts fail in practice. Ultimately, this analysis highlights the growing need to curtail the power of social media platforms, especially as these sites assume greater governing capability and influence over users’ rights. With Tumblr’s controversial ban firmly in place, this study not only contributes to the limited research on Tumblr and platform censorship, but it also has important implications for how power and freedom are negotiated online. <br />\n","Abstract Body: The extent to which online trolling behavior is caused by intrinsic traits or situational influences remains contentious. This research takes both dimensions into account, incorporating intrinsic (personality and emotionality) and situational factors (network structure and communication environment), to predict trolling behavior on Twitter. Using the 2019 Hong Kong protest as a research context, the researchers crawled over 17, 000 relevant tweets. Supervised-machine learning models were trained and applied to identify the intrinsic traits and trolling behavior, while a mention network was constructed to measure the situational influences. Taken together, multiple logistic regression was conducted and the results showed that, though personality and emotionality have their own predicting power, what matters the most is the communication environment. That is, as long as there is a troll surrounding a user, she or he is more likely to be a troll, regardless of what kind of person she or he is.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the temporal dynamics of emotional appeals in Russian campaign messages on two giant social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter. While several studies have noted the presence of emotional appeals in the Russian Internet Research Agency-created political campaign, few analyzed how this affective campaign contributed to influencing people. The current study conducts both computational and qualitative investigations of the IRA’s emotional-based strategies by exploring temporal dynamics of sentiment across three different contextual dimensions of message propagation: the platforms Facebook and Twitter, partisan identity (as targeted by the source), and social identity in politics, using African American identity as a case. We examine 1) the emotional flows that correspond to the campaign timeline as well as to different platform features; 2) emotional strategies of the Russian trolls that masked left- and right-leaning identities; and 3) how the messages display identity politics onto African Americans. Our findings show sentiment strategies weaving together different elements of political discourse, including specific targeting of African Americans during the 2016 campaign.\n","Abstract Body: Trolling – the online exploitation of website, chat, or game mechanics at another user’s expense – can and does take place all over cyberspace. It can take myriad forms, as well – some more overt, like trash-talking an opponent in a game, and some more covert, like misdirecting a new forum user to break a rule. However, despite this variety, there are few to no studies comparing the effects of these differing trolling types on victims. In addition, no study has yet taken into account users’ offline cultural context and norms into the victim experience. To fill this gap in the literature, the present study put participants from three culturally-distinct countries – Pakistan, Taiwan, and the Netherlands – in a simulated trolling interaction using Williams, Cheung, and Choi’s (2000) Cyberball game. Participants were either flamed (read: harshly insulted) or ostracized by a member of their own cultural group (ingroup) or a minority member (outgroup), and the participants’ emotional responses, behavioural intentions toward the other players, and messages sent during the game were taken as indicators of their response to the trolling. Results showed that, contrary to what is predicted in cross-cultural literature, our Taiwanese sample used the most reactive aggression when trolled and our Dutch sample was the most passive. In addition, ostracism generally produced the desire to repair relationships, irrespective of cultural context, while flaming responses seemed to be most affected by the victim's offline cultural context. Perpetrator culture (ingroup or outgroup) only produced an effect in the behavioural intentions of our Pakistani sample. Overall, it would appear that online and offline culture interact to produce the variety of responses to trolling seen in extant literature. Additional implications for future research into computer-mediated communication (CMC) and online aggression are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The present study examines how anonymity and incivility influence interpersonal evaluations and message persuasion in the context of online user comments. Results of an online experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 229) showed that the lack of identity cues of commenters undermined perceptions of credibility of commenters and persuasiveness of public discussion in the comment forum. Additionally, participants who read uncivil comments following a news article were more likely to negatively evaluate commenters and the content of online discussions compared to their counterparts exposed to civil comments. The study not only demonstrates the corrosive effects of online incivility on deliberative outcomes, but also provides evidence to better explain anonymous communication from the perspective of message receivers.\n",null,"Abstract Body: When discussing open communication in the digital age, we face a vital question: how can we have open communication with virtual beings or even treat them as research partners? Amid the booming virtual idols created via crowd-sourcing worldwide are the world’s first digital humans, notably the newly arisen AndyBot. AndyBot is the avatar of best-selling author Andrew Kaplan and aims to continue communication with coming generations. This implicates virtual existence as the next step for human immortality and calls for interdisciplinary study of complex digital being issues. Based on Baudrillard’s concept of hyperreal as “a real without origin”, this paper proposes that virtual beings promote the formation of a new reality with new origins. By analyzing Hatsune Miku and Chinese fans as a case study, this research explores virtual beings as avatars bearing our memories and argues that our interactions with them open channels for new communication and new reality.\n","Abstract Body: In this exploratory study, we call into question existing norms in VR research which value seamless experiences of immersion and presence. We find that discomfort, disorientation, and inconsistencies contribute in unexpected ways to users’ experiences, as well as to the overall aim of a production that are to deal with gender inequality. For this study, we interviewed professionals with extended experience in dealing with work-related gender issues in organizations who were tasked with reviewing three VR scenarios crafted to challenge gender roles. These professionals experienced limitations that were designed into the scenarios, which brought to light deep-rooted elements of gender norms that were difficult to reveal in other media. Current theory on VR lacks concepts that address the glitches and inconsistencies that were such a valuable element of this study. We there argue for the concepts of<i> awkwardness, implausibility,<\/i> and <i>distance<\/i> to expand our understanding of immersion<i>. <\/i>Such understandings, in turn, can help us theorize the implications of VR as a technique and expand the spectrum within which we can understand and design virtual experiences and narrative techniques.\n","Abstract Body: As the public use of virtual reality (VR) scales, understanding how users engage with VR content is critical. 360-video is a popular source of VR content due to its ease of creation and its ability to be viewed on cheap VR headsets that only track head rotation. There are, however, few studies of 360-videos, and what studies there are suffer from three limitations. First, most studies rely on small and homogeneous samples of participants. Second, they tend to examine only a single piece of VR content, or a handful of them in a few exceptional cases. Third, very few studies trace participants’ VR use over multiple experiences. The current study examined a large sample of participants (511) and a large set of 360-videos (80) which were cycled across participants. Each participant experienced 5 of the videos, and we tracked head movement in addition to self-report data on presence, simulator sickness, and future use intention for each video. This design allowed us to answer novel questions relating to individual differences of participants, changes in experience over time, the exploration behavior of the participants in relation to psychological response, and in general to present results of VR use at a scale not seen before in the literature. Moreover, the results suggest that looking at patterns across stimuli provide different insights than looking only within a single piece of content. Finally, we have made the 80 videos, as well as their corresponding ratings and movement data, publicly available for future research.\n","Abstract Body: This study aims to construct an empirical model of user engagement of wearable technology using survey data of smartwatch and fitness tracker users (N = 469). Four factors – physical interaction, interface assessment, cognitive absorption, and digital outreach – were examined as the critical components of user engagement that replicate an existing model. Results showed that the four concepts reliably constituted the measurement model of user engagement. The proposed user engagement scale showed great convergent validity with user attitudes toward wearable devices and word-of-mouth (WOM) behavior. The four aspects of user engagement consisted of a process model, where physical interaction predicted interface assessment, interface assessment predicted cognitive absorption, and cognitive absorption predicted digital outreach.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The promise of fitness trackers in promoting positive health behaviors lies in their ability to allow users to track their physical activity, receive personalized feedback, and connect with other users. Studies in disciplines such as public health and information systems, have examined predictors of fitness tracker use and antecedents of user engagement. Little, however is known about the process in which technology affordances of fitness trackers motivate individuals to engage with the technology, and if said engagement can improve health behavior. Guided by the Motivational Technology Model and Self-Determination Theory, this study sampled 970 American adults and examined the interplay between technology affordances (interactivity, navigability, customization), psychological needs (relatedness, competence, autonomy), engagement with fitness trackers, and fitness tracker use. The final path model showed that technology affordances significantly increased individuals’ sense of autonomy, competence and relatedness, which in turn led to increased engagement with and fitness trackers use. Among the three technology affordances, customization had a direct effect on user engagement. Theoretical implications related to the Motivational Technology Model along with design implications of fitness tracker technology are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study aims to propose an integrated model of health activity tracker device adoption that incorporates the Health Belief Model as well as information seeking behaviors. The proposed research model and hypotheses were validated and tested with data collected from a population representative survey (<i>N<\/i>=2006). The data was analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques including Structural Equation analysis. Our results show that perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits and self-efficacy are significant predictors of information-seeking behavior that mediates their effects on the use of health activity tracker, while severity perceptions directly affect the usage. The current study offers a theoretical contribution to the extension of the HBM and information seeking literature, while also providing practical recommendations for health technology developers and communicators of public obesity prevention campaigns.\n","Abstract Body: Smart wearable devices are revolutionizing how users communicate and acquire information. However, the user benefits of smart wearables largely depend on the devices’ ability to collect and analyze a large amount of user data. Extending the concept of personalization-privacy paradox to the context of smart wearables, the current study explores user responses to the smart wearables-privacy paradox through a survey (<i>N<\/i> =494). Using a cluster analysis method, we identified three distinct groups of smartwatch users—ambivalent, benefit-oriented, and neutral. The ambivalent users, who exhibit high levels of both perceived benefit and privacy concerns, were the largest group, followed by benefit-oriented, and neutral groups. We found that the ambivalent users, compared to the benefit-oriented users, tend to be young, male and highly educated, and to show high levels of technology self-efficacy and smartwatch usage. However, the ambivalent users displayed less positive attitudes and a lower continued intention of using the smartwatches.\n","Abstract Body: <br />Although there is a high level of concern about the effects of the near constant use of digital media in everyday life, the findings are mixed and inconclusive. Building on media multiplexity theory, we propose that one way to understand the inconclusive results is through investigating the media ecosystem used for communication in close relationships. Being always available offers security knowing that it is possible to connect with loved ones at any given moment while adding the stressor of maintaining constant availability to close partners. A dyadic longitudinal study of cohabitating romantic partners revealed that media multiplexity was associated with the perception that a partner is always available to help, which predicted increased well-being. Contrary to predictions, when a person expected their romantic partner to be immediately accessible and responsive, their partner also reported better well-being. This research extends the relational perspective on social media and well-being.<br />\n","Abstract Body: We explore the role of mindsets in the relationship between social media use and well-being. A mindset is a mental frame that selectively organizes and encodes information about a concept like social media, serving to coordinate an individual’s attention and guide their behaviors. We developed and validated the 23-item Social Media Mindsets Scale (SMMS) to systematically assess social media mindsets. Using factor analysis, we identified two mindsets: <i>tool mindsets <\/i>(“I believe social media is a helpful tool that lets me achieve meaningful goals”) and <i>addiction mindsets <\/i>(“Social media is a harmful addiction that negatively influences my thoughts, feelings, and behaviors”) (<i>N <\/i>= 161). These mindsets predicted psychological well-being above and beyond existing measures of social media use such as the amount, type, and intensity of use. Individuals with more of a tool mindset were more satisfied with life, more socially supported, and experienced less depression, stress, and anxiety. Individuals with more of an addiction mindset felt more isolated and experienced more depression, stress, and anxiety. Although self-reported amount of social media use was significantly associated with well-being, mediation analyses found that social media mindsets partially mediated this effect on psychological distress. These findings demonstrate that social media mindsets are a meaningful construct that shape an individual’s personal well-being over and beyond actual amount of use. The results suggest that it is not <i>how much<\/i> one uses social media that matters but rather <i>how one thinks about <\/i>that use.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Browsing content – viewing but not posting, sharing, or providing one-click feedback or comments – plays a significant role in many people’s social media use and is increasingly a focus of social media scholarship exploring outcomes such as well-being. Recent research often characterizes these browsing (but not clicking) activities as <i>passive use, <\/i>contrasting it with more desirable <i>active use<\/i> behaviors, and suggests it is associated with negative outcomes. Our study investigates the <i>non-click<\/i>—instances where people intentionally and thoughtfully withhold from clicking on content they do pay close attention to—in order to interrogate assumptions that browsing is always passive and devoid of authentic attention. Employing a combination of eye tracking, survey, and interview methods (N = 41), we found that there was no difference in attention (as measured by eye gaze duration) to clicked versus non-clicked posts, suggesting people do engage in attentive, active browsing. Our interview data reveals that non-clicked content is sometimes used as a “conversation starter” in other channels, where it serves as a stronger signal of relational investment than a one-click “like.” Finally, we find three audience-related concerns for non-clicking: concerns about the poster, the network, and the platform itself.  Future research directions are discussed.<br />\n",null,null,null,null,null,"Abstract Body: By the early-1990s, television viewing was becoming increasingly public, with screens proliferating in airports and bars and portable sets reaching 15% penetration. Mobile viewers consisted of valuable audience demographics: often younger, more tech-savvy, and having more expendable income. Nielsen and Arbitron began to see mobile tracking as, not just a way to recuperate these demos, but (with the digital transition in sight) key to the cross-platform future of audience measurement. Arbitron prototyped the first portable people meter (PPM) in 1993, but due to technological setbacks and publicity issues, they weren’t able to bring it to market until 2003. In this paper, I analyze interviews with Arbitron engineers, technology patents, and historical trade documents to detail the technological challenges of designing the PPM and Arbitron’s indecision about how to promote it during this ten-year period.<br /><br />Arbitron’s design for the PPM centered on two elements: attachment to the body and exposure-based tracking.Their task, therefore, was to engineer a device that could work seamlessly enough with the body to create usable data. For this, Arbitron worked with Martin Marietta Co. to engineer an audio code that broadcasters could embed in their program’s soundtracks. The code had to survive in any techno-acoustic environment and conform to all industry compression standards, all while being inaudible to the ear but detectable for the PPM—this proved to be an engineering feat. In addition, Arbitron had to ensure that panelists would consistently use the device. For this, Arbitron experimented with form factors, styling the device in the shape of accessories like watches, rings, and pagers. These design challenges—in conjunction with Arbitron’s indecision about whether to market the device as an active or passive meter—reveal the PPM’s complex relationship with the body. Is the PPM doing the labor of measuring the body’s exposure, or is it the body doing the labor for the machine? This dilemma was central to Arbitron as they conducted 25 field tests between 1993 and 96, resulting in five patented PPM “compliance incentives,” ranging from motion trackers to mechanisms for giving users points. Ultimately, drawing on media archeology and posthumanist frameworks, I show how Arbitron tested the limits of body/tech interfacing and embodied labor in ways that were both prescient of and influential to contemporary logics of mobile tracking and consumer commodification.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper looks at the Soviet video game industry and how they modified their video game messages to adhere to communist ideology. This paper looks at the birth of the Soviet video game industry at Attraction 71 in Moscow and how they transformed these western games into Soviet Games. We find themes in these modified messages such as lack of fantasy, lack of high scores, lack of a focus on fame and fortune and an increased emphasis on rural and industrial life. We also found that some types of games such as war games were changed very little from their western versions.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Ain't I A Woman?<\/i> was a Midwest publication produced by a collective of all-white lesbian women during the 1970s. In the midst of Black Power, Women's Liberation and Gay Liberation, members of the collective drew influences from other social movements to create content that addressed liberation on a broader framework. From June 1970 to May 1974, <i>AIAW? <\/i>tackled a variety of intersectional issues drawing from Black Power rhetoric, revolutionary feminism, and combating heteronormative norms. This study added to the historiography of queer feminist history and alternative media and print culture. It also addressed the understandings of social movements, activism, and the media. The women-only publication established a network with women across the country as they shared the personal experiences, community organizing efforts and conscious-raising ideas and theories.\n","Abstract Body: The following paper historicizes how current data-journalistic research and storytelling mimics the specific epistemological approach to data archiving and retrieval found in the work of data scientists and engineers of machine learning, as opposed to the approach practiced by database architects or statisticians. While data journalists historically have been encouraged to follow methodologies of the social sciences, the digital environment in which they investigate and write stories today increasingly prompt this professional community to adapt to real-time data flows and incomplete sets of data clusters. Consequentially, the methodological toolbox of surveying, sampling, and strict research design, which we will call the school of ‘supervised learning,’ is gradually giving way to a new ‘school,’ that of ‘unsupervised learning.’ Tracing this shift from one way of approaching data to another requires the overview of the organizational and technological histories of database managements systems (DBMS) and the transformations of the data engineering profession. The conclusion of this paper will be that the sense-making practices of data journalists followed organizational and technological shifts in the government and corporate sectors. Furthermore, data journalists’ reliance on data for their stories have mirrored their own shifting perception of what counts as source or evidence, and it also reflected their technological and computational expertise, which developed in tandem with the available resources of data storage and data processing.\n","Abstract Body: This media historiography examines how Protestant missionaries used films to transfer culture and promote Christian values in Turkey during the 1930s and 1950s. Missionaries sponsored, exhibited and distributed films under the labels of education, health and science. This study examines some of these films to evaluate how missionaries used films to build bonds with ethnic minorities such as Armenians and Kurds in churches and attract Muslims to attend missionary-sponsored schools and events. While the idea of converting Muslims into Christianity was a dream that missionaries were unable to achieve in Turkey, films were useful tools for missionaries to win the hearts of the people in Turkey and establish a prestige for American educational and medical institutions.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This is a research in progress on black  newspapers' treatment of the women's suffrage issue from 1900 to 1920. Preliminary findings show that black newspapers paid much attention to this issue and advocated for suffrage pointing out its overall benefits to the black community. The newspapers also denouced the racist elements that permeated this movement.\n","Abstract Body: This extended abstract discusses an ongoing project that examines the discourse of Palestine in Black newspapers and newsletters from 1967 and throughout the 1970s, the height of the Black Power Movement (BPM). The history of Black-Palestinian solidarity can be traced back to twentieth century global social movements. Mainstream and underground newspapers covering Israel and Palestine included the <i>Philadelphia Tribune<\/i>, the <i>Atlanta Daily World<\/i>, the <i>New York Amsterdam News<\/i>, <i>The Black Panther<\/i>, <i>SOBU<\/i> newsletter, and the <i>African World<\/i>, among others. In this extended abstract, we have indicated some preliminary analysis, highlighting how Black newspapers historically contributed to an emerging transnational network between Black Americans and Palestinian Arab people. Given that journalism, including advocacy journalism, has played a significant role in establishing the rhetoric around such contentious politics, it is crucial to examine the ways in which print culture has constructed meaning around domestic and international politics.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br />MIDI, abbreviation of Musical Instrument Digital Interface, is a technological standard for communicating musical instruments and computers. It is one of the most revolutionary digital music technologies in the post-industrial society, which makes a profound impact on today's music industry and human's hearing. Therefore, MIDI has become a typical intersection of technology, society and culture. Based on the perspective of historical and cultural studies, this research investigates how MIDI was created and diffused; reveals the relationship between technology and society by clarifying its political implications and cultural influences. In particular, this article will focus on how MIDI was introduced to China and what impact it had on China from three vectors of modernization, globalization and digitalization. Media archaeology will be used as the research method, which originates from the new historicism represented by Michael Foucault and many other scholars, such as Friedrich Kittler, Siegfried Zielinski, Jussi Parikka and so on. By dealing with above questions properly, the theoretical cognition of the relationship among technology, culture and society can be realized.<br /><br />In 1983, Dave Smith, the founder of Sequential Circuits and the \"\"father of MIDI\"\", reached a cooperation agreement with Roland, Yamaha, Korg, Kawai and other Japanese companies, which rapidly spread MIDI technology around the world. Before that, the electric music instruments and equipment of the various manufacturers were incompatible, and the electronic instruments they produced could not communicate with each other. If one musician used Roland's keyboard and the other used Yamaha, they could not cooperate. Smith's own company, Sequential Circuits, have produced a synthesizer known as Prophet 5 in 1978. In order to participate in the global competition better and make his own company gain an advantage, he advocated the adoption of a universal standard. At NAMM Show in January 1983, Smith displayed his collaboration with Ikutaro Kakehashi who is the founder of Roland Company, connecting Sequential Circuits' Prophet-600 Synthesizer to Roland's JP-6. Since then, other musical instrument manufacturers also attended this technological standard, and MIDI was officially born.<br /><br />As a modern digital music technology, MIDI has its own history of political meaning, economic dynamics, and cultural shaping. The invention of MIDI is based on the culture of claviocentrism, which means keyboards, first the musical keyboard and then the keyboard of computer, have dominated the musical world. As a modern technology associated with synthesizer and electronic music, its introduction to China is closely related to French electronic musician Jean Michel Jarre’s visit to China in the 1980s when China implemented the policy of reform and opening up, pursued the goal of modernization and joined the globalization process under neoliberalism ideology. In the 1990s, the development of personal computer accelerated the popularization of MIDI in China, promoting the digitalization of music, and even made it possible for AI composition nowadays. MIDI is usually described as a modern, technological and fashionable music technology under the progressive historical view and developmental narrative discourse which is exactly what the new historicism opposed. It is impossible to distinguish MIDI music technology from the form of capitalism in the 20th century, and it is also impossible to understand MIDI without considering the larger cultural context of late-capitalism and post-modernity. MIDI is not only a technological innovation, but also a political innovation. According to the investigation on MIDI history in China, it can be realized that the introduction and development of new technologies were determined by political economy and social culture, rather than the cliché of technological evolution or self-progress.\n","Abstract Body: This work-in-progress examines free press-fair trial tensions present in 1969 when Sirhan Bishara Sirhan was tried on charges of shooting U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy in a Los Angeles, California, hotel. Sirhan’s case focused national and international attention on important roles technology, news coverage, and actions of judges and attorneys served as members of the press, bench, and bar attempted to balance the public’s right to know with an accused person’s right to a fair trial. In a media environment comparable to today’s, frequent radio and television broadcasts and updated-throughout-the-day newspaper editions, judges felt they had a duty to rethink whether new-media technologies, such as television cameras, could harm fair trial rights while helping people learn about trials in the 1960s. This research explores how judges and attorneys sought to protect Sirhan’s fair trial rights while allowing news coverage and cameras in the courtroom. Second, the paper explores journalists’ evaluations of members of the bench and bar’s attempts to protect Sirhan’s fair trial rights and the media’s rights to cover his trial. The broader historical context, along with the formation of legal theory as it pertains to technology, will be discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines how a legacy of violence plays a role in dictator’s Internet censorship strategies. The assumption is that some dictators feel the threat of free flows of information more strongly than others, and thereby censorship is more worth the costs for them. A legacy of violence is one of the most effective and widely used messages by the opposition against dictatorship. My hypothesis is that dictatorships with a legacy of violence are more likely to heavily invest in censorship, ceteris paribus. This work in progress combines comparative historical analysis and regression analysis to explore this puzzle.\n","Abstract Body: This essay argues that the modern newswriting tradition should be traced back to the networks of Italian medieval merchants and Renaissance diplomats. As of the late 1200s, merchant letters reveal an increasing tendency to report important political and military events, as well as natural disasters, for the sake of business interests. The emergence of permanent embassies in Italy in the mid-1400s gave further impetus to the development of newswriting techniques, since one of the pivotal tasks of the Renaissance ambassadors was to keep their superiors back at home constantly informed about the evolving situations at the foreign courts. As a result, both merchants and diplomats had to break with the rigid medieval letter-writing tradition in order to develop new rhetorical strategies capable of capturing the complex realities they observed. Subsequently, this study analyzes some of the key elements of the emerging reporting style such as the dateline, the lead, basic story structures and their typologies, but also the early notions of objectivity that in its own way fostered also the techniques capable of conveying direct speech and dialogue. In conclusion, this essay points out some late Renaissance manuals for diplomats and their secretaries that already clearly formulated the six journalistic Ws and also pondered over the ability of news-writers to manipulate their audiences through spin.\n","Abstract Body: The main purpose of this paper is to provide the historical background and context to understand key moments that marked the evolution of television in Colombia. It describes the historical features of Colombian journalism, and the previous context that led TV to the advent of the Internet and social media in the country.\n","Abstract Body: This sociolinguistic Foucauldian discourse analysis examines biopolitical depictions of trans athletes in Sports Illustrated and sport culture through decolonial queer theory. Media framing communicates the selection and prominence journalists give to portions of emphasized, diminished or omitted textual characteristics. Commissioning interpretative packages (Gamson & Lasch, 1983; Gamson & Modigliani, 1989) allows for a complex qualitative analytic framework to examine devices that appear within groups of articles and how journalists frame experience. From the discursive sample (n=60), four interpretive packages emerged: Marginalization, Labeling, Fighting & Fairness and Pride & Affirmation. Former tennis professional Dr. Renée Richards appeared in all packages: a total of 16 articles and 26.66 percent of the total study’s sample. Richards’ agency as a productive athlete advantaged inclusion in sport. The study’s results illustrate that discourse has become more sensitive to trans issues. However, these results are presented with cautious optimism. Sport and media should dismantle antiquated, coercive sex/gender segregation and decolonize how it contributes to sex/gender-based oppression. Media outlets should focus on presenting fair, accurate and inclusive representations of transness.\n","Abstract Body: In media and communication studies, there are two literatures which are closely related but seldom brought into dialogue. The literature on media memories studies people’s media experiences through their memories. The literature on media generations focuses on how shared media experiences among an age cohort may produce a common generational consciousness with shared worldviews and values. This article integrates these two literatures to examine how media memories produce media generations. An analysis of 1,200 pages of memory narratives about internet bars in China shows that these memories have a generational semantics and a generational grammar. The production and sharing of these memory narratives constitute the self-narration of China’s netbar generation.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Croatia’s “Victory and Homeland Thanksgiving Day” (VHTD) is a state-sponsored event that commemorates the 1995 reclaiming of Croatian territories and the end of the Yugoslav war in Croatia. During the live-broadcast of the annual spectacle, Croatian people are encouraged to symbolically participate in the holiday and to identify with the story it tells. Dayan and Katz describe media events like these as ‘occasions of the state’. They “are televised as they take place and transfix a nation or the world”. Such events are used to disseminate a dominant state ideology along with specific ideas regarding the nation’s history and its place in the geopolitical map. This paper argues that VHTD imprints selective war memories into the collective consciousness and that such memories rely on anti-Serb sentiments and a partial distortion of history. Semiotic analysis of the footage from VHTD celebrations (1995-2015) along with interviews with Croatia’s two presidents, indicates that VHTD increasingly supports ultra-nationalistic ideas that have strengthened the hegemonic influence of the right-wing parties on collective memories. The article also argues that VHTD, in its current format, perpetuates the animosity towards neighboring Serbia and creates a ground for future conflicts rather than reconciliation or healing of the cultural trauma caused by the homeland war.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br /> <br />Scholars attempting to make sense of the rise of contemporary populist leaders have noted that these resort to communication techniques that resemble the rhetoric of the European dictators of the 1920s and 1930s. A xenophobic attitude against migrants, criticism of the elites and the galvanization of political supporters through a discourse of “us” versus “them” resonates the political climate that existed in European fascist regimes in the interwar period, opening the debate on the similarities and differences between the contemporary political landscape and the emergence of fascism in Europe. Building on this discussion, the paper discusses how the archetypal elements of fascism are present today’s populist movements, which lead these movements to fit into what Umberto Eco (1995) defined as “eternal fascism”. A particular focus will be given to the control over the media and the presentation of an idealization version of history: central features in interwar fascism also embraced by contemporary populist leaders. <br />The paper argues that understanding fascism and its legacies will allow for a better understanding of contemporary populism and its savvy use of the media. <br /> <br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper aims to examine what factors have determined the developmental trajectory of 60 years of Asian communication research as well as the research excellence of communication schools in Asia, primarily relying on the bibliometric data from the Web of Science database. Based on a proposed theoretical framework integrating Bourdieu’s capital theory and the institutional theory, the paper found that social capital is most important, whereas economic capital is least important. In addition, cultural capital concerning human capital is crucial, but other forms of cultural capital (regional English proficiency and a school’s research history) lack relevance. Moreover, a school’s research practices stressing the faculty’s interdisciplinarity and the formal institutional form are also critical to research performance.\n","Abstract Body: Relatively unknown to the wider world, the scientific community credits pharmacologist Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey for saving the United States from the thalidomide catastrophe that had global impact in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Awarded the President’s Medal for Distinguished Service by President John F. Kennedy on August 2, 1962, Dr. Kelsey has long been credited with the drastic midcentury overhaul of drug regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the subsequent high standards for drug licensing enforced today. In this analysis of Dr. Kelsey’s communications with the pharmaceutical company Richardson-Merrell regarding their FDA application for the drug thalidomide, I argue that her consistent and strategic responses to Richardson-Merrell embodied an epistemological filibuster that demonstrates the productive potential of this appeal to scientific (un)certainty. I identify three rhetorical tactics functioning within Dr. Kelsey’s prolonging arguments: (1) a centering of scientific uncertainty, (2) rearticulating “the master’s tools” to new ends, and (3) establishing a public advocacy by extending the case to consider broader implications. I outline how these tactics worked productively at the level of the technical sphere within this public controversy over scientific regulation that characterized Dr. Kelsey as both an FDA scientist and a public advocate. This analysis delineates the theoretical utility of the epistemological filibuster as an argumentative appeal and engages with Leah Ceccarelli’s desire for more specific definition and explication of a “scientific controversy” through a rhetorical history of thalidomide.\n","Abstract Body: ICA traces its founding to the creation of an affiliate organization of the Speech Association of America, an organization called the National Society for the Study of Communication. This paper considers the intellectual stakes at work in the founding of NSSC, stakes that emerged from and were largely informed by issues in speech instruction in the early- to mid-twentieth century in the US. Working largely from the recently established ICA papers, I explain how NSSC's founders understood their own work in creating NSSC and detail the series of events in 1949 that led to the creation of the organization. I argue that NSSC's (and by extension, ICA's) founding derives largely from issues that arose from concerns connected to the teaching of the 'communication course' in the 1930s and 1940s. The exigences at the heart of NSSC were tied up largely with how to teach a wide range of undergraduates, and had little to do with issues in what we now consider the social sciences or with scholarship per se. I conclude with tantalizing (or at least frustrating) notes concerning what all of this meant for the trajectory of the organization in the mid-twentieth century.\n","Abstract Body: This paper profiles the United Artists (UA) collection housed at the Wisconsin Centre<br />for Film and Theatre Research (WCFTR). The collection documents the United<br />Artists’ legal and financial operations from the company’s star controlled phase<br />(1919-1951), and it also contains a large number of film materials including the<br />Warner, RKO, and Monogram Film libraries, and the Ziv television library. These<br />materials have been invaluable to researchers and institutions interested in studio era<br />Hollywood, and have played an integral role in disseminating and preserving<br />American moving image heritage and film history. Yet, there remains a dearth of<br />literature on the histories of such important collections, despite the appearance of<br />scholarship in recent years that has widened the scope of historiographical writing in<br />media studies to include histories of film preservation practices. This paper addresses<br />this gap by tracing the network of historical factors that enabled the UA collection’s<br />acquisition, while drawing attention to the ways in which the value of the collection<br />and its uses has been forged in dialogue and in contest with institutional agendas,<br />within its particular archival and research spaces, and the larger landscape of film<br />studies and its shifting methodological preferences. By examining ongoing legal<br />disputes between the IRS and Transamerica (UA’s corporate owners), I demonstrate<br />how appraisers drew upon competing discourses of preservation and archival practice<br />to justify their radically different valuations, despite the fact that correspondences and<br />memoranda indicate how appraisers had competing financial and self-promotional<br />motivations for arriving at such different figures. In addition, I draw from interviews<br />with WCTFR directors and analyze scholarly works that draw from the collection to<br />demonstrate how the collection’s scholarly value has shifted according to UW<br />Madison’s and film studies’ methodological preferences. Examining the legal<br />disputes that pertain to the collection alongside the scholarship that has drawn from it<br />allows me to trace the myriad ways in which the collection’s value has shifted over<br />time. It also allows me to highlight the large number of materials in the collection that<br />remain uncatalogued – an issue of importance given the ephemeral nature of audio-<br />visual material, and the wealth of paper materials that have not been digitized.\n",null,null,null,"Abstract Body: This paper investigates the political economic intersections between precision agriculture and rural broadband by introducing the concept of the “agriculture-broadband nexus.” The agriculture/broadband nexus is comprised of a rather seductive set of discourses – the wow factor of precision agriculture chief among them. But it also encompasses the need to double our food supply in the next half century (Perdue, 2019), the rise of the so-called “internet of things” or what Richard Adler (2015) calls the “internet of growing things,” the rise of big data, and the never-ceasing presence of the marketplace and advanced capitalism (Mosco, 2017).<br /> <br />It is for these discourses that we have seen a massive industry and political push for broadband to the farm in the United States. Indeed, precision agriculture is one of the major reference points for politicians endorsing the deployment of broadband in rural counties. The rhetoric proved persuasive and in 2018, as part of the omnibus 2018 Farm Bill, Congress passed the Precision Agriculture Connectivity Act of 2018, which ordered the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to establish a Task Force For Reviewing Connectivity and Technology Needs of Precision Agriculture in the United Sates. As John Deere said to the FCC in a 2014 filing, “if it works the land, it needs mobile broadband.” But, what does this mean, and what are the implications of this statement when we bring together two industries that are already dramatically concentrated?<br /> <br />Precision agriculture (PA_ refers to the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) to the practice of agriculture (Whitacre, Mark & Griffin, 2014). These technologies range from GPS/GNSS-embedded tractors combines and seeders, to barns and pens equipped with sensors for monitoring livestock, to sensors in fields monitoring moisture and pH, to drones taking high-resolution images, to the mapping of yields, the monitoring of yields, and the ability to prescribe seed plans, fertilizer input and water.  In sum, PA is the complete intersection of digital technology and agriculture, which begins and ending with the home computer at the farm. This digitalization of the farm has conjured images of the “smart farm” or “connected farm” (Wolfert et al. 2017) and is the agrarian manifestation of what Vincent Mosco (2017) calls “the next internet” of cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things.<br /> <br />Key here to is the use of data – big data – to make strategic decision regarding planting, watering, and fertilizing.  As John Reid (2011) has noted  “a modern, high-end agricultural machine system is effectively a mobile, geospatial data-collection platform with the capacity to receive, use, sense, store, and transmit data as in integral part of its operational performance.”<br /> <br />Precision agriculture has three major applications: mapping, monitoring, and management. Mapping refers to the employment of GPS and GNSS data to locate equipment, enable automation, precision guidance or automated steering, and coupled with the data provided by sensors, literally map the cropland terrain.<br /> <br />Monitoring generally takes the form of yield monitoring, which allows the grower to determine which sections of her farm are producing adequate and desirable yields. Yield monitoring is one of the most widely adopted precision agriculture technologies amongst row crops. A 2016 USDA study found that 40% of large corn farms, representing 70% of all corn cropland used yield monitors while a quarter of farms translated that data into yield maps (Schimmelpfennig, 2016). Similar numbers are present for soybean farmers.<br />Combining mapping and monitoring allows farmers, or, more often than not, third-party data analysts to develop clear action plans for agriculture and field management (the “smart” in smart farming). Key here is a practice known as variable rate application (VRA), which is defined as the “adjustment of the amount of cropping inputs such as seed, fertilizer and pesticides to match conditions in a field” (Shannon, Clay, Kitchen, p.255). <br />Seen in concert, mapping, monitoring and management mark the next generation of agriculture and the basis of precision agriculture practices. None of these practices are possible, however, without a reliable broadband internet connection. Today, at least 17 million rural Americans lack access to broadband. Moreover, only 75% of farms have an internet connection, let alone the necessary high-speed broadband connection necessary to realize precision agriculture. <br />The most advanced precision agriculture technologies, like certain soil monitors, and advanced combines even come equipped with modems that allow for wireless transmission of data and real-time data analysis. Downloading and uploading that much data requires a reliable and robust broadband connection, and a datastream that cannot hope to be completed by a mobile connection alone. Indeed, in a 2018 paper Hambly & Chowdry (2018) noted that broadband availability is a major predictor of precision agriculture adoption. Hambly and Chowdry also report that while the basic PA applications can be managed with a 2G or 3G mobile signal, more advanced actions like device monitoring and remote control will require a 4G signal with between 1.5mbps and 5bps availale. In short, farmers need broadband as much as engineers in Silicon Valley and streamers on Netflix (Whitacre, Mark & Griffin, 2014).<br />Without broadband and the possibility for real-time communication, data is often stored on a USB drive, manually transported from the equipment to a home computer, or, a computer in a nearby town, with broadband access, and uploaded to the data processor, this takes and costs both time and money. Automation is key here, as Whitacre  et al. (2014) conclude “in order for precision agriculture to become standard practice by a critical mass of farmers, data transfer must become completely automated and passive such that no human interaction is required”<br />Through an analysis of rural broadband policies in the United States and interviews with rural broadband providers, farmers, and representatives from the major farm associations – The American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers Union, and the Grange - this paper argues that the exuberant discourse of rural broadband and precision agriculture masks deeply entrenched and unresolved political economic issues that span both industries. We see this false consciousness manifest in three instances of the broadband/ agriculture nexus: <i>representation<\/i> on the broadband map, <i>ownership <\/i>of the data generated by precision agriculture practices, and <i>control <\/i>of the technology. I demonstrate how each of these dynamics serve the interests of incumbent broadband and precision agriculture companies at the expense of the user and the farmer. Said differently, this relationship within the rural broadband/industrial agriculture nexus - illustrates what Hendrickson et al. (2017) call industrial agriculture’s “mode of power” – the reproduction of power within capitalism – and expands it by looking at how inter-industry modes of power serve to reproduce themselves. <br /> <br />What is evident in the three themes is the parallel goal of incumbent telecommunication companies and incumbent agribusiness companies to keep customers within a walled garden or closed system of equipment, data, and materials. John Deere, for instance, wants input into the national broadband map, wants to harness users data, and wants to police the repair of John Deere equipment. In short, it wants farmers to buy, farm, sell, and connect through John Deere interfaces. Similarly, the lack of deployment of broadband to rural and agrarian America signals a lack of choice for customers, if the option of broadband exists at all.  <br /> <br />I argue that until these issues of closed systems are resolved, a more temperate discourse is required so as to not cede rural Americans digital sovereignty to the major agribusiness and telecommunication companies and further exclude and disenfranchise the farmer and rural broadband consumer. <br /> <br />This extended abstract complements the theme of ICA 2020 – “Open Communication” – by inverting its connotations and focusing on the implications of the establishment of a “closed system of communication” within precision agriculture. In doing so, it analyzes both the regulatory and political economic dynamics that have allowed for such a closed system of communication to develop in the practices of precision agriculture and the policies of rural broadband in the United States.<br /> <br />Works Cited<br />Adler, R.

The idea is that the closer content is to the ‘red line’ of ‘potentially harmful’ according to community standards the higher are the odds to take the content down. This policy goes hand in hand with the efforts of social media platforms to counteract allegations their algorithms would favor harmful content to increase user engagement. Instead of waiting for content to cross a certain line, they prefer removing it ahead. But what does a vague term like “borderline” mean and does it have any legitimacy in a legal debate around harmful online speech?\n","Abstract Body: The study applies a socio-legal approach to evaluate the impact of the annexation of Crimea on the regulation of live performances and tour management of Russian music performers in the Ukraine and of Ukranian performers in Russia. Study design includes the analysis of Russian, Ukranian, and Soviet laws and policies as well as in-depth interviews with 30 practitioners. It is argued that the new regulations have increasingly politicized music business in both Russia and Ukraine.  <br />\n","Abstract Body: Entertainment and technology have become synonymous. Technology companies evolved from entertainment content distributors into content creators. Technology’s capabilities with respect to audience outreach, market research, and transactional efficiency, has truly changed the very nature of how we access and engage entertainment content. We find ourselves in one of the most innovative moments in history with respect to entertainment technology. In this era of innovation, our transactional laws and intellectual property laws are tested to their limits, and reveal whether their legislation is forward-looking enough to ensure that content creators receive the full benefit of their creative rights. Arguably, the global music industry has been the most disrupted by technology in the past fifteen years.<br /><br />The magnitude of this disruption stems for a fundamental and systemic sociological issue that has always plagued the music business—inherent mistrust. This mistrust originated from the exploitive nature of traditional music recording and publishing transactions and the malfeasance of industry executives toward artists since the beginning of the rock ‘n roll era. Because of such business practices, music rights information has remained largely confidential, and this data is treated as proprietary information of copyright holders. This is has led to the scattering of unreliable and largely inaccessible music rights data—turning music licensing into a burdensome, unpredictable, scavenger hunt for prospective licensees. The problem continues to be exacerbated by music creation software enabling the ubiquitous creation of music without any central global database or shared ledger for music rights metadata or transactions pertaining thereto. As a primary example, digital service providers (“DSPs”) democratized music consumption by bypassing the intermediary between artists and consumers (the copyright owners). DSPs, who now account for the dominant market share of music consumption through a lending / rental business model, disrupt the traditional music sales and licensing system exploited by content owners. In this regard, it is increasingly clear that our music licensing system is broken, given the proliferation of copyright infringement lawsuits against DSPs for failure to properly obtain mechanical licenses for music provided on their platforms.[1] DSPs such as Spotify have argued that the lack of shared data on music rights provides a loophole under U.S. copyright law, enabling the DSP to freely store recorded copies of musical works on its server and/or allow its users to download tethered copies of such musical works. Regardless of whether a prospective music licensee is a film producer or digital music service provider, industry practices do not provide a solution to navigate and legally secure music licenses, let alone with any confidence in the trustworthiness and reliability of rights information. In this way, data and metadata related to music catalogs are arguably as as valuable as the catalogs themselves.<br /><br />This paper is a cross-disciplinary analysis of the legal, sociological, and technological factors that have led to the current state of mistrust and isolation of data in the context of music licensing. Moreover, it explores the legal and technological solutions being offered to rebuild trust, namely: (1) the United States’ formation of a quasi-governmental music licensing collective (“MLC”) mandated by recent legislation known as the Music Modernization Act[2]; (2) the implementation of blockchain technology to create a viable music licensing system that benefits both DSPs and rights holders, and simultaneously address data deficiencies by creating a decentralized record of transactions using “smart contracts”; and (3) a comparative legal analysis of how other international jurisdictions streamline treatment of specific music license (i.e., compulsory fees vs. negotiated). This paper seeks answers to the following questions: what does a new, shared, global music licensing system look like? Who will control it? Should it be integrated into a new international treaty through the World Intellectual Property Organization? Will that control alleviate or catalyze the problem of mistrust in the music business.<br /><br />This paper discusses the merits and flaws, among other solutions, in the deployment of a music licensing blockchain to create a global, decentralized ledger of music transactions, which is open to see by anyone using the blockchain. The benefit of a blockchain is its by-product—the “smart” contract. In this system, all music licenses would be executed on the blockchain and the relevant rights data would be verified on the blockchain before any transaction is effectuated. Upon verification of pre-requisite rights and legal consideration, the transaction would be automated. These streamlined transactions would be enforceable under traditional contract law in the applicable jurisdiction, and would create a reliant process for music licensing. This poses the further question of whether or not the global music industry should adopt a music-centric crypto currency. However, the problem with smart contracts is that they are controlled by computer coding (“if-then”) language. Smart contracts are not able to consider concepts such as copyright fair use, nor necessarily the varying factors accompanying negotiations for music synchronization, such as the substantive narrative in a film scene for which music is being licensed. They are also unable to address the most common issue for non-corporate copyright owners—dispute resolution. There is no automated mechanism for disputes as to actual uses of music, and the cost-prohibitive nature of litigation often diminishes the strength of copyright owners’ rights. This does not provide any assurances to a non-trusting rights holder. Still remaining is the question of how to compel music creators and rights holder to upload initial music data into a music licensing blockchain platform. In this sense, we must reconsider our ability to enforce copyrights—requiring rights data to be shared on a public blockchain prior to enforcement. Many think-tanks, governmental and private entities are racing to assemble a complete music licensing database. Until that information is decentralized, it may be a fruitless effort if we want to restore trust in the music business.<br /><br /><br />[1] <i>See e.g.<\/i> <i>Melissa Ferrick et al v.

This paper reevaluates the concept of the “public sphere” in transitioning Chinese society in the digital era. Social media, as an expansion of people’s gathering in physical spaces, intends to serve as an open public media and a virtual space where the open public discussion takes place. However, the openness and the freeness of the public sphere are pressed when new media technologies are applied unfairly or when social media are subject to media policy, internet regulations, censorship, and agenda-setting. Through elaborately interpreting the texts and the usage of laws and policies, this paper seeks to investigate the formation of the distinct digital public sphere from the legal and regulatory perspectives, and the regulating of openness and freeness this forming process brings to the Chinese digital public sphere.\n","Abstract Body: As one of the first Western democracies, Germany has passed a law to tackle illegal and hate speech online, the “NetzDG”.

When it is “hybrid-speech advertising,” which blurs the lines between editorial and commercial content. This paper examines the issue of hybrid-speech advertising in the context of publicity rights and examines in depth a federal circuit court opinion that denied full First Amendment protection to a corporate ad paying tribute to an athlete.  It suggests that courts should err on the side of protecting this type of speech to the fullest extent possible, rather than treating it as commercial speech.  Finally, it suggests that American courts consider incorporating the Anglo-Australian doctrine of “passing off” into these types of cases as a way to better serve the public interest and protect against the over-regulation of noncommercial speech.\n","Abstract Body: Social media platforms act as regulators in reviewing user content but are also regulated by laws. Through a representative survey of U.S. internet users (N = 1,022), we explore the antecedents of support for social media content review, and for regulation of social media platforms by the government. Results are discussed in light of third-person perceptions about potential effects of social media content, as well as the impact of platforms in society.\n","Abstract Body: As consolidation in the US residential broadband market continues, there is concern that that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are “cherry-picking” areas for upgrades to fast broadband services.  This paper examines this question for Los Angeles (LA) County during the 2014-17 period. In particular, it probes for evidence that ISPs are neglecting investments in low-income areas and communities of color. The analysis is based on the most recent deployment data available for fixed residential services collected by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) in combination with demographic information from the American Community Survey (ACS). Because the spatial distribution of investments cannot be directly observed, broadband competition and the availability of fiber services are used as proxies. The findings indicate that competition and fiber-based services are less likely in low-income areas and communities of color, with the most severe deficits observed in census block groups that combine poverty and a large percentage of Black residents. Alternative policy tools to address spatial inequalities in broadband investments are outlined in the conclusion.\n","Abstract Body: The intense scrutiny placed on technology giants like Google and Facebook in response to ‘fake news’ has led to governments of countries like Australia, China, France, Germany the Philippines and Singapore enacting laws and regulations that sought to control or punish these companies for perpetuating falsehoods online. Many of these laws have been criticised as draconian and infringing on media freedom, although most were passed with much public consultation or public debate. The case of Singapore offers a compelling reason why more attention needs to be paid to such public consultations. Wrapped in the veneer of democratic participation, the seemingly consultative governance surrounding Singapore’s Protection from Online Falsehood and Manipulation Act (POFMA) exhibited a process we call ‘disciplining narratives’, which seeks not to silence voices that oppose the law, but to openly engage such dissent in complex and open discourse, amplified through the media. This paper seeks to provide an understanding of disciplining narratives, which leverages Foucault’s concept of governmentality, and how such an “art of government” legitimises the state to pass even the most high-handed of laws.\n","Abstract Body: The digital divide in the United States has been a concern of policymakers, scholars, providers, and rural residents for over 20 years. This conversation has recently intensified with the release of several high profile reports, the coming deployment of 5G, and acute attention of lawmakers at both the federal and state level with the approaching 2020 election. Despite dozens of bills proposed, and billions of dollars spent, however, the United States is no closer to closing the rural-urban digital divide that has left 19 million rural Americans without access to broadband connectivity. Drawing on a comprehensive critical discourse analysis of policy documents, this paper demonstrates how a discourse of “good enough” has come to dominate current rural broadband policy. This discourse serves the material interests of incumbent telecommunications companies by justifying their broadband deployment strategies, while simultaneously disenfranchises rural communities.\n","Abstract Body: India, one of many constitutional republics to have criminalized libel, arrested numerous users of blogs, Facebook, and Twitter in the years 2012-13 under its constitutional law of “reasonable restrictions” that balanced the fundamental right of individual expression not only with a competing right of reputation, but also with social norms: national security, public order, and morality. Web freedom in India declined steeply in that period in public perception. This paper discusses the constitutionality of the legal provisions that were cited in the antecedent arrests: the Information Technology Act of 2000, the Indian Penal Code of 1860, and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act of 1971. It examines the arrests in a frame of “reasonable restrictions” interpreted in Supreme Court of India jurisprudence. Finally, it offers six prescriptions of structural, content-based, and attitudinal reform of the Indian system of freedom of expression to reconceptualise the freedom of expression, abolish criminal libel, evolve a test of reasonableness, and strengthen civil justice.\n","Abstract Body: The marijuana industry continues to grow at a rapid pace within the United States. Marijuana remains illegal federally, but more states have legalized the substance recreationally, or medically. This paper examines the nuances of marijuana advertising and commercial speech laws in the United States. The United States government has left much of the establishment of marijuana advertising regulations up to individual states, which has led to complex and differing regulations. This paper provides a robust case analysis of various state and federal statutes related to marijuana advertising and their constitutionality based on jurisprudence.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Empirical research on how the right of access is exercised in practice is very limited, especially in terms of studies, sample size and sample diversity.

This article describes the results of a large-scale investigation (n = 220) on how data organizations handled the right of access under the former EU Data Protection Directive. As such, it aims to establish a more reliable benchmark for future GDPR evaluations.\n","Abstract Body: <i>In December 2018, the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee published a report detailing how the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the flagship federal state media agency, illegally targeted Americans with its content through social media 860 times over a two-year period. This report illustrates the risks associated with U.S. state media, yet companies such as Twitter are defining state media in a way that exempts USAGM networks from their state media policies. To address the growing threat of U.S. state media covertly influencing public discourse, this paper and research sets forth an apolitical definition and test for identifying state media so that it can be labeled appropriately across platforms to aid media literacy. <\/i>\n","Abstract Body: Governments collect and produce vast quantities of information, much of which they store, some of which they destroy. Journalists in the United States have long relied on robust transparency regimes to ensure that they have access to this information. One such regime are states’ open records laws, which have received little attention compared to transparency laws at the federal level. This gap in transparency literature risks leaving local media practitioners in the dark in the face of ever-evolving state records laws. By rethinking the role that professional relationships play in journalistic negotiations of the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law, the riddle of records denials can then be more suitably addressed. For the problem, I assert, is not merely how frequently government agencies deny journalists the data and documents they seek but rather the constellation of power struggles that arise between actors in the ‘media’ field.  In doing so, this paper makes three central contributions. First, it offers a descriptive account of Pennsylvania’s transparency regime and how it has percolated into local journalistic practices in Philadelphia. Second, it draws on semi-structured with Philadelphia-based reporters and editors to probe the role of interpersonal tensions and relationships in efforts to locate, parse, and circulate government information. In the process, it reveals the diverse interpersonal practices that journalists maintain in an attempt to oil rusty statutory transparency mechanisms. Lastly, I propose ways in which journalists themselves can navigate the ‘foggy’ media field by reckoning with the ways in which transparency regimes in Philadelphia largely hinge on the power of personal relationships.\n","Abstract Body: The global nature of the internet means that sooner rather than later there will be a need for an international governance standard. U.S. First Amendment exceptionalism sometimes blinds us to the fact that free expression is a universally recognized right defined, but key differences remain regarding defamation, hate speech, and other issues. A human rights-based approach to a global regulatory model should be a necessary first step to defining how the internet will be governed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Conducting a case study on the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), this paper analyzes the US governance of data privacy. Despite having advocated corporate self-regulation for consumer privacy, the United States began to take a rights-based approach to data privacy, California being the first state to introduce its own law in June 2018. In early 2019, California held public forums  on the CCPA, which then became a battleground for diverse stakeholders to discuss data privacy regulations. Examining 105 public comments by 99 speakers in the 7 CCPA public forums, this study identified that corporate representatives and consumer advocates differed in seven major areas: (1) purpose of the CCPA, (2) definitions of personal information and consumer, (3) operationalization of opt-out, (4) nondiscriminatory rules, (5) economic ramifications, (6) consumer literacy, and (7) comparison with other privacy frameworks. The findings suggest that corporate speakers tend to frame data privacy against innovation while consumer speakers frame it against discrimination.<br />\n","Abstract Body: As women increasingly hold their sexual harassers and rapists accountable both legally and in the media, public figure doctrine has become a key component of determining liability in defamation cases between victims and accused perpetrators. This paper will examine the history of public figure doctrine in defamation cases, discuss how that media and legal history has led to contemporary defamation cases, and ponder how that landscape might evolve in the coming years.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Music is more than mere entertainment; modern research shows that it can be an effective therapeutic tool. Music can be a vehicle to express what our own words sometimes fail to say. Music can be harnessed to stimulate both psychological and psychological change. Music offers therapeutic benefits for premature infants and elderly adults with dementia. Music can decrease patients’ perceptions of pain, and it can assist with a patient’s palliative care and the family’s grieving process. The social utility of music therapy is undertheorized and underexplored from a legal perspective. This is worrisome because copyright law directly impacts this clinical discipline. The well-known concerns about fair use uncertainty and rightsholder overreach are at play for music therapists. To ensure robust safeguards for this burgeoning field, a statutory exemption for therapeutic uses of music is warranted.\n","Abstract Body: General trust describes how much one expects others to act with goodwill to themselves and has been an important variable in communication scholarship. A recent hypothesis posits that general trust is regulated by the behavioral immune system and functions to defend against diseases. Prior research supported the hypothesis by finding a negative correlation between the motive to avoid diseases and general trust, but the data were cross-sectional and thus unable to draw causal inferences. We tested the hypothesis with a panel dataset. Fixed-effects models showed that, while subjective vulnerability to contagious diseases negatively and significantly correlated with general trust before and after controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, the correlation dropped to non-significance after we controlled for the subjective vulnerability to non-disease risks. Further, a cross-lagged model revealed significant bi-directional effects between vulnerability to diseases and general trust. These findings offered limited support to the disease-avoidance hypothesis of general trust.\n","Abstract Body: Objectives: Minimally regulated e-cigarette advertising may be one potential factor driving the increasing prevalence of young adult electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use. The current study examined young adults’ attention to e-cigarette advertisement features.<br /> <br />Methods: Using a within-subjects design, 30 young adults viewed e-cigarette ads. Areas of interest (AOIs) included: 1) brand logo, 2) product descriptor, and 3) people. During ad viewing, eye-tracking measured participants’ dwell time and time to first fixation for each AOI as well as each ad brand. Harm perceptions pre- and post-viewing were measured.<br /> <br />Results: Participants spent the longest dwell time and fixated fastest on people within the advertisements, followed by product descriptors, then brand logos (<i>p<\/i>s < .001). Harm perceptions decreased after viewing the ads (<i>p<\/i> < .05).<br /> <br />Conclusions: Young adults may be most drawn to people in e-cigarette ads and regulators and policymakers should account for this when formulating marketing restrictions.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Introduction: Given the rapid rise in vaping and the influence of e-cigarette advertising on behavior and brain responses, fostering youth’s critical analysis of advertising through media literacy (ML) has become a critical prevention and behavior change strategy. This pilot study examined the impact of ML messaging on (1) changes in adolescents’ brain activation in cognitive control regions when viewing e-cigarette advertisements, (2) changes in anti-vaping ML scale scores, and (3) self-reported susceptibility toward e-cigarette and traditional cigarette use.<br /><br />Methods: Twenty-two non?smoking adolescents (Range: 13-18, Mage=16.14, SD=1.58) were enrolled in the study and 18 had usable functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. During the fMRI scan adolescents viewed e-cigarette and matched neutral advertisements before and following a brief ML messaging (audio and text formats) delivered in the scanner.<br /><br />Results: Brain responses to e-cigarette advertisements compared to neutral advertisements decreased in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) following ML messaging. Brain activation in the dlPFC to e-cigarette advertisements prior to the intervention was correlated with changes in ML scores between pre- and post-intervention (rs(17) = -.56, p = .02), showing that participants who responded the most to e-cigarette advertisements prior to ML messaging showed the largest change in ML scores. In addition, susceptibility toward traditional cigarettes was reduced following ML messaging (p = .001).<br /><br />Conclusions: Targeting cognitive control mechanisms using ML may be a viable prevention strategy to counter the lures of e-cigarette advertisements.\n","Abstract Body: The non-medical use and abuse of prescription medications on college campuses is a serious public health concern associated with a wide range of negative health-related consequences. Current approaches to reduce non-medical use of prescription medications (NUPM) are largely ineffective. This proposal uses a biopsychological model to predict how people process and remember information from anti-NUPM PSAs. The central hypothesis is that messages that co-present pleasant and unpleasant information trigger physiological arousal, cognitive resource allocation, and ambivalence about NUPM use, regardless of prior use. These increases in ambivalence, physiological arousal, and cognitive resource allocation lead to increased information processing (i.e., searching for normative information in the environment to reduce the ambivalence). Therefore, the prediction here is that providing anti-NUPM social norms during co-presentation will lead to 1) a reduction in attitude ambivalence, 2) more negative attitudes toward NUPM, 3) greater memory for the social norms, and 4) lower intentions for NUPM in the future.\n","Abstract Body: With more than 25 million tests sold by early 2019, direct-to-consumer genetic ancestry tests expose the public to critical issues of genetics, ancestry, and identity. This study examines how individuals understand the results of a genetic ancestry test. Twenty undergraduate students engaged with the explanation developed doubts about the test’s credibility. There was little consensus about low viewed and interpreted an unfamiliar individual’s ancestry results. In an in-depth interview students indicated that the results were easy to read and understand, but they had difficulty articulating the meaning of ancestry groups. Students could not accurately paraphrase the test’s scientific explanation. Those who -proportion ancestry and identity. Some students reserved judgment while others identified specific thresholds designating legitimate identity. Results contribute to the literature on the public’s understanding of science, genetic literacy, and data interpretation, and can be used to contextualize future instances of public response to newsmakers’ genetic ancestry results announcements.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: ancestry, data interpretation, direct-to-consumer genetic tests, genetic literacy<br />\n","Abstract Body: Mukbang (\"\"eating broadcast” in Korean) is a viral phenomenon around the world. In a typical Mukbang video, the host eats a large amount of food while facing a video camera to entertain viewers. Despite its popularity, the potential impacts of watching others eat on viewers remain unexplained. Through psychological, physiological (galvanic skin response, eye-tracking, facial emotion recognition), and behavioral measures, this study presents that food types and portion sizes affect how viewers feel and eat.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Little is known about how individual differences may influence conformity. One potential individual difference that may be related to conformity is self-construal, which measures the relationship of the individual to the collective. The current study aims to examine whether differences in self-construal (interdependence and independence) are related to the neural process previously associated with conformity. The current study recruited 62 participants aged 18-31 to complete an fMRI conformity task and a self-report measure of self-construal. Our results demonstrated that a stronger interdependent self was associated with conformity, whereas a stronger independent self was not. Interdependent self was significantly associated with two ROIs, such as conflict monitoring and mentalizing, but not associated with positive valuation. Results that were not significant are reported in the full abstract. Overall, these results suggest that those who have a stronger interdependent view of the self (compared to a weaker interdependent view of the self) are potentially more likely to conform to social feedback when their opinions misalign with others.\n","Abstract Body: The current analysis expands on the flow hypothesis using a nuanced perspective on interactivity via the <i>interactivity-as-demand<\/i> model (Bowman, 2018) by looking at how the root components of flow—effort and reward—can be manipulated and measured separately within a bespoke video game (Huskey, Craighead, Miller, & Weber, 2018). Flow is an enjoyable, absorbing, and engaging experience brought out by an optimal balance task challenge and individual skill (Csíkszentmihályi, 1975). Albeit conceptually simple, flow has proven difficult to operationalize. Asking individuals to self-report flow states both (a) requires breaking those very states and (b) do not often consider antecedents to the state (Bowman, 2008), such as task challenge and individual skill critical to attainment of flow in video games—flow is highest when challenge and skill are balanced (Sherry, 2004). Keller and Bless (2008) found that attention was also highest when effort and individual skill were similarly balance. This concomitant relationship allowed for assessment of flow using behavioral and neural measures unlikely to disrupt the actual flow state (Huskey et al., 2018; Huskey, Wilcox, & Weber, 2018).<br /><br />For this study, reward and effort were separately manipulated such that participants experience three different gameplay situations (boredom: high reward/low effort, flow: high reward/high effort; frustration: low reward/high effort). We first examined the capacity for those gameplay scenarios to induce flow (both behavioral, using secondary reaction time measures, and self-report measures). We then examined enjoyment as an indicator of reward, and cognitive demand as an indicator of effort—generally expecting enjoyment to be highest in flow and cognitive demand to be highest in the frustration condition.<br /><br />Participants were <i>N<\/i> = 123 US college students with overall moderate gaming experience, recruited to play <i>Asteroid Impact<\/i> (Huskey et al., 2018) for three consecutive sessions of four minutes each in a randomized order. Enjoyment and flow were measured using items from Huskey et al. (2018). STRTs recorded delay between seeing and responding to on-screen distractors during gameplay (Huskey et al., 2018). Cognitive demand was measured using the video game demand scale (Bowman, Wasserman, & Banks, 2018).<br /><br />Preliminary analysis of the STRTs suggests the game was not fully successful at inducing flow (Table 1). Self-report measures align with this claim (Table 2), as flow and enjoyment were nearly isomorphic, and enjoyment was neutral (and invariant) in boredom and flow conditions. Unexpectedly, cognitive demand was also invariant within conditions, albeit subjected to significant order effects; when looking only at first game played, cognitive demand was significantly (and unexpectedly) lowest for the frustration condition (Figure 1 & Table 3); this same condition had the highest variation in response times.<br /><br />Measures of reward and effort seem to vary with changes in the rewarding nature and effort requirements of gameplay conditions, rather than attentional flow states themselves. Cognitive demand self-reports indicate a “tap-out” effect (Fisher, Hopp, Weber, 2019) —when demands are too high, individuals halt resource allocation. Or, perceptions of demand could be based on relative reward rather than the actual cognitive or perceptual effort. Expanded analyses should include measures of gamer skill and in-game performance, as well as game conditions more adept at inducing flow states. Game order effects seem to anchor all perception scores and should be further investigated.\n","Abstract Body: Our national political discourse is increasingly partisan with little to no common ground for compromise. Our theoretical proposition in this study is that this lack of common ground has to do with the elicitation of psychological reactance by political information that is counter-attitudinal, and that these reactance responses can be predicted by an individual’s psychobiological traits above and beyond their political identification. Thus, this paper investigates the interaction of psychobiological traits (measured as the propensity to approach or avoid stimuli), political identification, and the presence of counter-attitudinal information on the psychological process of state reactance. The proposed study utilizes a 4 (topic: gun control, abortion, immigration, and taxes) x 2 (pro- and counter attitudinal) x 2 (order) experimental design with data collection occurring at two sites that have different prior voting histories.\n","Abstract Body: The State and Evolution of Communication Research: A Topic Modeling Analysis of 20,000 Journal Article Abstracts from 1918-2015<br /><br />Tremendous growth in the communication discipline during the past century has raised fundamental questions about what it means to study human communication. This project reports an attempt at answering such questions by exploring the themes that animate communication scholarship over time and across journals sponsored by different scholarly organizations. We used topic modeling to examine the abstracts of more than 20,000 articles across 22 journals from their beginnings through 2015. The results offer insights about the state and evolution of communication scholarship. Research has evolved from being predominately focused on pedagogy to examining a wide variety of phenomena that mark an increasingly diverse field. The role of scholarly organizations in contributing to disciplinary fragmentation is considered, as well as the field’s relatively limited focus on underlying and contextually-transcendent processes in favor of specific communication contexts.\n","Abstract Body: The Motivation Activation Measure (MAM) has been used to demonstrate biological motivations underlying a number of communication science phenomena. This paper was conceptualized to extend the theoretical utility of the MAM by examining whether the metrics produced by the existing index can be reproduced by similar, but narratively different, images, and to extend the methodological utility of the MAM by adding these new images to a structure that would allow a researcher to create a unique sample of the MAM for each experimental design, rather than using the same images repeatedly. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Our ability to test and falsify theories rests on valid and reliable measurement. Minimizing noise, or measurement error, is a hurdle researchers must overcome. Researchers use state-of-the-art tools to investigate the cognitive underpinnings of human communication behavior and measurement error is likely to differ by instrument. Accordingly, it is important to determine if a given instrument is sufficiently accurate to extract signal from noise. Reaction time is commonly used to measure cognitive processes during media use. A reaction time tool has recently been implemented in Asteroid Impact, an open source, naturalistic, experimental video game stimulus. We tested if reaction time latency differed across software (Python 2, Python 3), computer operating system (macOS, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04), and trial measurement modality (visual, auditory) in Asteroid Impact. We found that Asteroid Impact accurately records reaction time data.\n","Abstract Body: This study provides an Exploration-Exploitation Model of media multitasking, suggesting that people’s decision tendency toward exploration activates multitasking behavior, while a tendency toward exploitation keeps people media single-tasking. Moreover, we also propose that intrinsic motivation (curiosity) elicits exploration (vs. exploitation), determined by the intrinsic properties of the media tasks, such as novelty and uncertainty. A preliminary test at the individual difference level was performed and supported the Exploration-Exploitation Model of media multitasking. Specifically, a Pick A Door Task (a version of the Four-Armed Bandit task) was used to measure trait tendency toward exploration (vs. exploitation). However, the association between trait curiosity (as intrinsic motivation tendencies) and trait media multitasking was not supported, which leaves a question regarding how the intrinsic and extrinsic value of information together influence people’s exploratory (vs. exploitive) media behaviors.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Social media has become increasingly essential in our society. Given that social media platforms often contain condensed social cues, information, and interaction, they pose increasing demand for social information processing for the users. Prior studies have provided self-report evidence that social media use is associated increased perspective taking tendiences, as well as anatomical neural evidence that Facebook use is associated with greater grey matter volume in brain regions involved in socio-semantic processes. Yet, how social media use may be associated with neural responses to social cues is still largely unknown. In the current study, adolescent male Facebook users (ages 16 - 17, n = 59) reported their habits related to Facebook use and tendencies for perspective taking. They also completed the cyberball task, a virtual game aimed at simulating social inclusion and exclusion, while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Findings indicated that habitual Facebook use was associated with higher neural activity in the mentalizing network (including DMPFC, precuneus, and bilateral TPJ) during social exclusion. By contrast, our results showed no link between habitual Facebook use and self-reported perspective taking. Instead, habitual Facebook use was associated with individuals’ tendencies to transpose themselves into mediated characters. These results provided evidence that habitual social media use is associated with higher social cognitive neural processing in response to salient social signals, such as exclusion.\n","Abstract Body: Goal-directed spatial decision making video games combine spatial mapping, memory, and reward; all of which can involve hippocampal excitation through suppression of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma aminobutyric acid. In this study, gamma aminobutyric acid was measured before and after 30 minutes of video game play within a voxel around the hippocampus. It was predicted that all participants would experience a decrease in gamma aminobutyric acid during gaming, and gamers would experience a greater decrease than non-gamers. However, these hypotheses were not supported. Instead, the only significant predictor of hippocampal gamma aminobutyric acid concentrations after video gaming was performance on a spatial memory task conducted prior to gaming. Those who performed better on the spatial memory task had lower hippocampal gamma aminobutyric acid concentrations after gaming. Although initial concentrations did correlate with concentrations after gaming, intitial concnetrations did not correlate with spatial memory, suggesting that the decrease happened during the gaming experience. <i>Keywords: <\/i>hippocampus, gaba aminobutyric acid, goal-directed spatial decision making, neurotransmitters, spatial memory\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Previous studies have investigated the usage intensity of social media and associated social capital and empathy, but it is still unclear about the relationship between social media intensity and prosocial behavioral intentions and its underlying process. Guided by both the social-cultural theories explaining the prosocial emotional and behavioral consequences of social media intensity, and evolutionary theories explaining empathy as a function to activate adaptive prosocial behavioral outcomes after social media intensity signaling reciprocal interactions, this study examined the mediating roles of affective and cognitive empathy and sympathy in the relationships between Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram intensity and prosocial behavioral intentions. Results showed that individuals high in Facebook and Instagram intensity, who tend to initiate and maintain reciprocal relationships with significant others, show higher cognitive empathy and sympathy (Instagram only) and thus are more likely to have higher prosocial intentions. However, this is not the case for individuals high in Twitter intensity because of the features of Twitter as a micro-blogging platform that do not favor reciprocal connections.\n","Abstract Body: Our tendency to conform has been well-documented. Since Asch’s (1955) famous line experiments, researchers have consistently found that people tend to adjust their behaviors, attitudes, and personal preferences in order to align with others (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004). Recently neuroscientists have begun to build on our understanding of conformity be examining the underlying processes that contribute to aligning with others. Findings suggest that conformity is associated with the activation of brain regions associated with error detection, mentalizing, and positive valuation (Cascio, Scholz, & Falk, 2015). However, the neuroimaging studies that have observed the processes described above have generally been interested only in the extent of a participant’s misalignment with others and not the valence of the social feedback. There is reason to believe this focus might neglect an important component of the experience. Behavioral studies using tasks similar to the neuroimaging studies above have found that downward attitude adjustment is more pronounced than upward adjustment (Hesslinger, Carbon, & Hecht, 2017). In addition, these differences in valence may be heightened during adolescence, a period characterized by increased salience placed on social relationships (Steinberg & Morris, 2001).<br />Therefore, the current study examined whether conformity is processed differently depending on the valence of the social feedback (downward versus upward adjustment) in adolescents. In order to answer this question we recruited 78 males teens (aged 16-18 years old) who completed an fMRI conformity task (figure 1).<br />First, we conducted a whole brain analysis that examined the contrast of conforming to social feedback that peers rated apps higher than the participant compared to conforming to social feedback that peers rated apps lower than the participant (figure 2, table 1). Results indicated that conforming to lower feedback (downward adjustment) compared to conforming to higher feedback (upward adjustment) was associated with increased activity in the VMPFC, MPFC, and DMPFC, among others (<i>p<\/i>=.001, <i>k<\/i>>50).<br />Next, we examined the contrast of conforming to social feedback that peers rated apps lower than the participant compared to maintaining one’s initial rating when exposed to social feedback that peers rated apps lower than the participant. Results indicated that conforming to lower feedback was significantly associated with neural activity in the VMPFC, among others, <i>p<\/i>=.001, <i>k<\/i>>50 (figure 3, table 2). Finally, we examined the contrast of conforming to social feedback that peers rated apps higher than the participant compared to maintaining one’s initial rating when exposed to social feedback that peers rated apps higher than the participant. No significant neural activity was witnessed (<i>p<\/i>=.001, <i>k<\/i>>50).<br />Overall, the current results suggest that among adolescents’ conformity is processed differently depending on the valence of the social feedback, such that conforming to lower feedback (downward adjustment) is associated with increased activity in the DMPFC, MPFC, and most robustly in the VMPFC, regions not witnessed when conforming to higher feedback (upward adjustment). Given the MPFC, DMPFC, and VMPFC have been implicated in self-processing, mentalizing, and positive valuation, it may suggest that they may be important in conformity involving downward adjustment.<br /><br /><br /><br />References<br /><br />Asch, S.

An individual gets bombarded with anywhere from 4,000 to 10,000 ads every day. Therefore, it is increasingly critical to understand the key factors that influence how people respond to advertisements such as emotion, visual cues, and attention. Here, we used neuroscience insights to understand the impact of advertising content on the ability to retrieve and recall information at a later time. Participants <i>(M<\/i> = 41.9 years of age, <i>SD = 15.94,<\/i> <i>n<\/i> = 60) were exposed to 60 advertisements divided into three conditions based on the nature of the content: <i>functional<\/i> advertisements featured functional details about the product, <i>emotional<\/i> advertisements focused more on emotional and social components of a product or brand, and <i>metaphorical<\/i> advertisements sought to draw parallels between the ad content and a metaphor. A week after exposure to the ads, subjects returned for an fMRI session where they were asked to recognize the snippets from the ads they had seen earlier. We found greater activation in emotional regions like amygdala and fusiform face area for emotional ads, while functional ads showed the greatest activation in primary visual areas associated with feature-based attention. Emotional and metaphorical ads showed greater activation relative to functional ads in the temporoparietal junction, a region commonly associated with mentalizing and theory of mind. These findings suggest that while emotional ads may be ideal for capturing immediate attention, they may be counterintuitive in the long term with respect to remembering details about the ad.\n","Abstract Body: A fundamental question in political communication is why voters make political decisions the way they do. Existing accounts are based on psychological, sociological, and rational choice theories of decision making and are typically not informed by cognitive computational models. Cognitive models have provided a powerful framework for predicting and explaining behaviors in other domains. In this study, we take an important step in understanding the political decision-making process by addressing whether a cognitive model of value-based decision making from the field of neuroeconomics can account for political choices.\n","Abstract Body: We conducted an experiment to test if masculinity beliefs would predict self-reported and physiological fear experienced while playing a horror video game.

This study design is influenced by work that demonstrates emotion and empathy influences prosocial donation behavior (Genevsky & Knutson, 2015; Genevsky, Knutson, & Yoon, 2018; Kogen & Dilliplane, 2017; Small & Verrochi, 2009). This proposal builds off of a completed pilot study (N=155) where participants were exposed to a 3 (image emotion: negative, neutral, or positive), x 2 (low or high amount of likes) x 2 (sponsored or organic) design that involved 36 Instagram posts. Preliminary findings suggest that not only does emotional valence carry weight in how people act, but other features of Instagram posts such as the number of or likes or being labeled as “sponsored” influence prosocial decisions. Participants donated more to negative posts than positive and neutral posts. A second effect of likes and sponsorship on donation behavior was also found, suggesting that the amount of likes and labeling a post as “sponsored” influences prosocial behavior online.\n","Abstract Body: Deepfakes are sometimes presented in the media as a threat to our elections. But in the social sciences, deepfakes have hardly been studied. As such, whether people indeed change their attitudes after exposure to a deepfake is unclear. A potential reason for this lack of empirical knowledge is the technical difficulties associated with making a deepfake. In this study, we describe a deepfake experiment as well as the technical steps required to make a deepfake.\n","Abstract Body: Quantifying Nonverbal Coordination and Rapport in Dyadic Interactions<br />Background<br />Social interaction is a complex and highly demanding task. It can unfold in a harmonious and effortless way, yet sometimes also fail catastrophically. A most critical determinant of interaction success is whether the partners ‘click’ on a nonverbal level and are able to establish <i>rapport<\/i>. Rapport is an essential factor in almost all communication contexts (Cappella, 1990), from initial contact formation and conflict resolution (Drolet & Morris, 2000) to therapeutic interventions (Cooper & Tauber, 2005) classroom interactions (Murphy & Valdez, 2005; Nguyen, 2007), business negotiations (Gremler & Gwinner, 2000; Macintosh, 2009), and more. Rapport manifests itself in the dyadic entrainment of nonverbal behavior, including mutual attentiveness, reciprocal positivity and motor coordination (Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal, 1990). Grahe and Bernieri (1999) hold: “…that rapport is primarily a physically manifested construct; it is a construct that is visible at the surface and readily apparent” (p. 265). In fact, observers are able to assess rapport from a dyad’s nonverbal interaction very swiftly and with high consensus (Bernieri & Gillis, 1995; Bernieri, Gillis, Davis, & Grahe, 1996; Gillis, Bernieri, & Wooten, 1995). Yet, they fall short to identify reliably the relevant cues and subtle dynamics that cause their impression (Bernieri & Gillis, 1995). In fact, research has long struggled with this same problem. We have recently identified two major methodological causes for this situation: (1) the stimulus problem, which refers to the use of video recordings that convey stereotype relevant information (e.g. gender, culture, race, etc.) potentially biasing observer’s rapport judgments, and (2) the observer problem, which refers to the problem of detecting and accurately describing the subtle and fleeting phenomena putatively responsible for rapport (Bente, 2019). As we demonstrated, motion capture technology as well as hereon based character animations can solve both problems, providing rich and accurate behavioral information as well as neutral stimuli for impression studies. However, these methodologies leave open the question how to extract measures of entrainment and coordination from the complex movement protocols, as issued by the motion capture procedures. The current paper distinguishes between different types of motor coordination as a prerequisite for targeted operationalization and suggests specific approaches to parametrize, quantify, and analyze a variety of coordination phenomena.<br /> Types of Motor Coordination<br />Coordination as an element in human interaction is observable in manifold forms. For instance, behaviors such as postural sharing, mutual eye gaze, entrained sway patterns, walking in stride, or motor synchrony each represent coordination, but manifest distinctly. Overall, two poles have emerged as anchors of a “coordination continuum”: mimicry and synchrony (see Figure 1), which stretches from coordination based on form to coordination based on timing/rhythm respectively. At the left end of the spectrum, mimicry represents a sharing of static or movement forms between individuals. The far left anchor is postural sharing, which is a static matching of postures between people. The second to the left is dynamic mimicry, or the comparison of changes in posture among dyadic partners over time. Next, second from the right, is instructed synchrony, such as a synchronized dance routine. Last, as the right anchor, is temporal synchrony with non-isomorphic behaviors, such as spontaneous synchrony of movements in a conversation.<br />As this continuum suggests, coordination behaviors can differ in numerous ways. To operationalize properly the coordination behavior at hand, several criteria warrant consideration. First, as mentioned, is whether the nature of the coordination centers on temporal or spatial congruence. Second is the level of complexity: low versus high. Here, low complexity refers to coordination constrained to a single dimension (i.e., horizontal movement along the x-axis; e.g., Noy, Dekel, & Alon, 2011) or aggregated among entire bodies (e.g., MEA, Ramseyer & Tschacher, 2011), whereas high complexity refers to three-dimensional and/or full-body movement measurement. Third is the prior constraint on coordination in terms of rules. This broad consideration includes form-based constraints, environmental constraints, or other specific rules (or lack thereof) guiding the coordination. Fourth is whether there is a strictly defined leader-follower relationship, or whether the coordination is more reciprocally adaptive (i.e., <i>emergent<\/i>). Fifth is whether the pace-making entity is a source external to the interaction, such as a conductor or metronome, or is intrinsically produced and maintained by the interactants. Lastly, one may consider whether the coordination is purposeful/deliberate or spontaneous/automatic. Each of these criteria produces a slightly (or largely) different phenomenon, a crucial point to understand for those implementing conceptual and operational definitions of coordination behaviors.<br />Approaches for Parameter Formation and Analysis<br />                Due to the highly varied nature of coordination behaviors, a wealth of measurement techniques have been developed to assess different components of coordination. Here we look at five of these measures and examine which aspects of coordination they address. We emphasize the fact that these measures are in fact distinct operational definitions, and thus should be used to assess distinct elements within the broader term of coordination.<br />First is pose differencing (PD; Poppe et al., 2014), which assesses both static and dynamic similarities between two people’s postures. Second is windowed cross-lagged correlations of movement activity (WCCs; Boker, Xu, Rotondo, & King, 2002), which measures correlations in the degree of movement change among dyadic partners. Not only are these correlations calculated “on the spot” (i.e., when looking at both Participant A and Participant B at the same moment in the time series), but at a range of lags specified by the researcher (e.g., when Participant A is two seconds behind Participant B). Thus, WCCs provide a comprehensive picture of both on the spot and delayed movement similarities (see Figure 2). Third is co-confident motion (CCM; Noy, Dekel, & Alon, 2011), which examines the degree of ‘jitter’ between participants’ movement timing shifts – that is, the smoothness observed at both participants’ zero velocity moments. Fourth is mutual information (MI; Johnson & Bobick, 2001), which is a measure of statistical dependence between two random variables. It is based on calculating how much information one can derive about one system based on the other. In the case of coordination, MI gives the overall degree of dependence between two time series of movement data. Lastly, we use the wavelet approach (e.g., Fujiwara & Daibo, 2016). This is a time-frequency domain analysis that examines the coherence (i.e., spectral power, or the amount of mutual movement activity happening at a given frequency) between two time series at each component frequency. The wavelet approach is useful for analyzing rhythmic similarities for unstructured conversations, as this measure does not assume stationarity of time series data.<br />We will demonstrate the applicability and explicatory power of the different approaches for various forms of coordination. These include (a) one-dimensional motor synchronization in the so-called mirror game (Noy, et al.  2011), (b) complex, yet instructed, movement coordination in a joint Tai Chi performance, as well as (c) complex, yet spontaneous, coordination patterns of postures and movements in unstructured conversations. The paper will present various visualization tools as well as algorithms for the calculation of parameters suitable for inferential statistical comparisons.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Memes are becoming a useful source of data for analyzing behavior on social media. However, a problem to tackle is how to correctly identify a meme. As the number of memes published every day on social media is huge, there is a need for automatic methods for classifying and searching in large meme datasets. This paper proposes and compares several methods for automatically classifying images as memes. Also, we propose a method that allows us to implement a system for retrieving memes from a dataset using a textual query. We experimentally evaluate the methods using a large dataset of memes collected from Twitter users in Chile, which was annotated by a group of experts. Though some of the evaluated methods are effective, there is still room for improvement.\n","Abstract Body: Given the ubiquity of camera phones and photo-sharing networks, individuals increasingly use visuals for self-expression and social interaction. While extensive research has demonstrated that language use is inextricably connected to individuals’ psychological processes, limited research has looked at how visual media use in computer-mediated environments reflects psychological functioning. We examined one specific case, emotional expressions, and constructed a collection of “visual vocabulary”—which we termed as “visual LIWC”—people might use for expressing different emotions. We retrieved and computationally analyzed 89,069 Instagram photos tagged with 103 emotion terms (e.g., #happiness, #excited) within two weeks. We showed that certain aesthetic attributes (e.g., colorfulness) and content attributes (e.g., use of text) systematically varied across emotions of varying levels of valence and arousal. Together, this study demonstrates that aided by computer vision techniques, visual media in computer-mediated environments could be a rich data source to reveal individuals’ psychological worlds.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The mass media is an important source of new knowledge and new concepts for the public, shaping the \"\"visibility\"\" of the reported objects. This research mainly uses text mining and frame analysis method to study 233 reports about Internet addiction in People's Daily from 1996 to 2019 in China, identify and describe its stage characteristics, the use and evolution of news frame, and conduct a diachronic test on the diffusion and cognition of the concept of \"\"innovation\"\" of Internet addiction. Internet addiction is a concept full of variables, which has a dynamic interaction with social, political, cultural and other factors. With the \"\"Daily\"\" use of the Internet, the \"\"fuzziness\"\" of the difference between addiction and functional use, as well as the flexibility, controversy and moral fuzziness of the diagnosis of Internet addiction, make the performance and perception of Internet addiction more complicated.\n","Abstract Body: Dictionary-based sentiment analysis (DSA) has become increasingly popular among social scientists in general and communication scholars in particular. Although the approach facilitates empirical examination of expressed sentiment on a large scale, there is a limited understanding of how the DSA approach can accurately capture the sentiment embedded in written texts. The current study empirically evaluated the validity of DSA approaches in the context of a public health crisis and identify textual features that lead to the inaccurate sentiment classification when compared with human coding. In study 1, we systematically reviewed public health research and identified LIWC, AENW, and SWN as the most popular DSA approaches that have been adopted in the health domain. In study 2, we evaluated the validity of five different DSA applications and found inconsistency of sentiment outputs. In study 3, we investigated textual features and found valence reversal causes misclassification of DSA.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Social support and conversations exchanged via social networking sites (SNSs) are consequential for shaping health beliefs and behaviors. However, since the large corpus of user-generated content exchanged on SNSs has been overlooked, partially due to the absence of advanced analytic techniques, our understanding about the content and consequences of health conversations on SNSs has been limited. By innovatively applying structural topic modeling and sentiment analysis to analyze 10,127 unique posts,  this exploratory study identified nine doimant topics and longitudinal frequency of positive and negative sentiments on the r/loseit sub-Reddit. Linear and negative binominal regression analyses were conducted to understand what messages features (i.e., topic and sentiment) influence the evaluation of the messages and the number of comments generated, which sheds light on the communication environment of weight loss sub-Reddit. Finally, by parsing the flairs posted by users that indicate their weight information, we also predicted users' weight loss by the message features.\n","Abstract Body: <i>The number of fake news articles in digital media ecosystems are increasing exponentially, disrupting the free flow of accurate, or at least good-faith, communication. The consequences of this fake news trend are detrimental to individuals and society–both economically and politically–especially since social media has made accessing and consuming news media easier and more accessible than ever before. Taken together, the increased rate of production and the immensely favorable and fast-moving social media environment, fact-checkers can no longer keep pace with misinformation. In this study we propose a model of fake news identification by combining an ‘opinion/news editorial section’ classifier–built from article texts using extreme gradient boosting algorithms. The results of the model show that this method can identify fake news with an accuracy of 98.8% beating the previous first rank in Kaggle fake news competition.<\/i>\n","Abstract Body: Bots and other malicious actors have the potential to manipulate information flow, shape political movements, or incite violent action. Research has suggested that between 9 and 15% of active Twitter accounts are bots, that they are responsible for much disinformation during election periods, and that they exacerbate political conflict by targeting social media users with inflammatory content. However, research has not provided much evidence on how the attention that this type of information campaigns gets compares with the reach of mainstream news, which also generate large portions of social media activity. Here, we link two data sources (Twitter activity and web browsing behavior) to compare the visibility and attention that news outlets get in social media and on the larger web during a period of intense political mobilization. Our goal is to determine if there is a discrepancy in the visibility and reach of news sources, and determine if bot activity is behind the discrepancy. Ultimately, our goal is to analyze the extent to which the information environment that people inhabit changes depending on the channel they use to access information.\n","Abstract Body: Distorted information is becoming increasingly discussed as serious problem for democracies. While scientists, journalists and politicians are trying to find a way to deal with the phenomenon, the ongoing debate rather contributes to an increased ambiguous use of the term “fake news” and the erosion of its meaning as a consequence. The connotations of the concept range from a perceived threat to democracy to a narrative to discredit traditional news media or opponents in a political debate. The current study investigates which concepts twitter users have in mind when discussing fake news via automated content analysis. The results show that the used connotations refer to a hostile perception of established media and attack public figures and societal institutions. Applications of the term in the context of fact-checking or debunking cannot be found. Implications for social media debates and analyses are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: When comparing media coverage or analyzing which content people are exposed to, researchers usually do not conduct their analyses on the level of an individual article, but choose a level of abstraction, such as topics or issues. In this paper, we develop a theoretical argument for introducing the ``news event'' as a level of analysis. Based on this, we discuss several computational approaches to empirically detect such news events in large corpora of news coverage in an unsupervised manner. In particular, we compare approaches based on traditional tf-idf based cosine similarities with approaches that rely on word embeddings, such as the softcosine measure. We show that both methods, combined with a network clustering algorithm, are suitable to detect news events. Finally, we apply this method in a case study of 45k news articles from different outlets, in which we show that different news outlets have distinct profiles in the events they cover.\n","Abstract Body: This study attempts to predict audience-rated news quality based on journalistic values, linguistic/formal features, and variables derived from information processing models and news reception literature. We employed a traditional social science survey of over 7,800 news audiences and implemented natural language processing, text-mining, and neural network for 1,500 news articles concerning public affairs. Results suggest that journalistic values are stronger predictors than linguistic/formal features and news audience attributes. Specifically, believability, depth, and diversity were more important in predicting news quality than readability, objectivity, factuality, and sensationalism. Bylines, sources, subjective expressions, and article similarities were also influential. Besides demographics, general knowledge had a stronger predictive power, compared to issue involvement, issue-specific knowledge, press credibility, political discussion frequency, and news media use. This study contributes to the understanding of the combined effect of the news content, presentational, and audience attributes on news quality evaluation and demonstrates how to embrace computational approaches.\n","Abstract Body: This paper presents a method and open-source tool in R for linking event data to news articles. We apply this method to analyze event level predictors and country level variance of terrorism coverage in The Guardian from 2006 to 2015, using event data from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). Based on two validation strategies we show how our approach can be used as either a standalone analysis or as a preparatory step for a manual content analysis. In addition, we propose a novel unsupervised validation strategy, and provide preliminary evidence that this strategy can be used to estimate good settings for the matching algorithm (e.g., preprocessing, threshold) if no gold standard is available. An online appendix is provided that documents all code to replicate and reuse our analysis, including scripts for downloading the open data from The Guardian API and the GTD and our gold standard.\n","Abstract Body: How can we measure the ideologies of social media accounts?  How can we validate the measurement?  How can we track changes in ideological landscape of social networking sites? This study conceptualizes ideology as a multidimensional latent variable that can be inferred from user-generated content and the structure of retweet network and demonstrates a novel approach of mapping ideological positions using a recurrent convolutional neural network (RCNN).  The measurement’s external validity is established by evaluating the model’s predictive accuracy on other years’ data as well as its consistency with the judgements made by an expert panel.  The model was then applied to illustrate the ideological diversity of 4,182 random users and 96 newspapers on China’s Sina Weibo between 2015 and 2018, revealing the intertwined relationships among newspapers, general public, and the state’s information control efforts.  The proposed approach is applicable to all types of polities and can shed helpful light on the political communication studies in a time of disrupted democracies.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores two forms of message diffusion in social networks — broadcast diffusion and viral diffusion. These contrasting conceptions of diffusion describe patterns through which content can spread on social networks and influence others, and are thought to be linked to the status of the users or the nature of the content. We seek to distinguish viral diffusion, where the messages spread sequentially, from broadcast diffusion, where a message reaches many users in a single initial step. To do so, we first explicate these patterns of diffusion and then develop systematic measures to quantify them. Next, we validate these conceptions by examining the most widely retweeted messages during the 2016 debates, which contained many posts that gained wide diffusion within the 90-minute span of each event. In our analysis we find that for successful broadcast diffusion, the typical tweet-creator was an elite user (having large number of followers and a verified Twitter account), and, for successful viral diffusion the typical tweet-creator was a non-elite user (having relatively small number of followers and a non-verified Twitter account). We found that non-elite users’ popular tweets diffuse with a very different pattern compared to popular content created by an elite user. The viral diffusion is slow and sustained, while broadcast diffusion is fast and short-lived. More important, we found our measurement proxies for broadcast and viral diffusion — Average Reposting Speed (ARS) and Speed-Time-Correlation (STC), respectively — were predicted by the user and content characteristics were expected based on our conceptual definitions.\n","Abstract Body: Recent research has suggested that manipulating the affordances of social media platforms may offer a tractable way to control the health and deliberative quality of online discussions on politics. Beyond a general notion of the advantages of anonymity for greater participation, and its drawbacks to hold participants less accountable, little is understood about how the anonymity of online participation interacts with other profile features to lead to a more toxic or a more deliberative discussion.  To address this gap, we present the findings from an experiment to measure the effect of manipulating the personalization of online profiles and party identities of groups, on the health of online discussions, operationalized in terms of the linguistic qualities of deliberation that ensue in issue-focused discussions. Our findings will offer promising insights for the design of social media platforms, cross-domain applications for text-based measurements based on machine learning, and recommendations for future studies of computer-mediated communication.\n","Abstract Body: The identification of bots is an important and complicated task. The bot classifier \"\"Botometer\"\" was introduced as a way to estimate the number of bots in a given list of accounts and, as a consequence, has been frequently used in academic publications. Given its relevance for academic research, we ask how precise Botometer is. To do so, we collected the Botometer scores for four datasets (two verified as bots, two verified as human; n=4,558) in two languages (English/German) over three months. We show that the Botometer scores are imprecise when it comes to estimating bots; especially in a different language. We further show in an analysis of Botometer scores over time that Botometer's thresholds, even when used very conservatively, are prone to variance which, in turn, will lead to bots being classified as humans and humans being classified as bots. This has severe consequences for academic research as most studies using the tool will unknowingly have a high number of false negatives as well as false positives. We conclude our study with a discussion about how communication scientists should evaluate automatic tools.\n","Abstract Body: In the work presented here, we take a data-driven, computational approach to uncover the network structure of media multitasking behaviors in a sample of 1742 young adults in the US. We find that overall increases in multitasking intensity are associated with greater severity of ADHD symptoms and greater attentional failures in everyday life. Furthermore, we find that different media multitasking behaviors are differentially related to attention problems, with mobile (phone) multitasking most strongly related to detrimental outcomes. These results indicate that the relationship between media multitasking and attentional outcomes of interest may vary depending on the topology of a person's \"\"media multitasking network.\"\"\n",null,"Abstract Body: <br />Survey researchers use multi-item measures (\"\"scales\"\") to cope with measurement error in survey responses. The paper illustrates that this approach can also reduce measurement error in content analysis data. The general insights from measurement theory are translated into a simulation which simulates coding at different levels of coding accuracy and with different quality of the indicators. It shows (a) how multi-item measures versus single-item measures perform in terms of correlation with the \"\"true value\"\" (data quality) and (b) what levels of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) multi-item content analysis measures would achieve given the quality of the indicator and the accuracy of coders. Using multiple indicators per construct can improve data quality substantially even if coding accuracy (and hence: inter-coder agreement) is mediocre and too low regarding conventional rules-of-thumb for “sufficient” inter-coder agreement. Using multi-item measures boosts data quality the most at moderate/borderline levels of coding accuracy, potentially allowing the measurement of some constructs where subjective judgments of coders limit inter-coder agreement.\n","Abstract Body: Algorithmic recommender systems are assumed to generate segregated publics and, in consequence, polarization and political fragmentation (Pariser, 2011; Sunstein 2018). However, convincing empirical evidence of filter bubbles is sparse (Flaxman, Goel, & Rao, 2016; Zuiderveen Borgesius et al. 2016). The paper investigates the effects of recommendation mechanisms on the possible fragmentation of publics. Agent-based simulation is used to shed light on the gap between theoretical argumentation and empirical findings. Along the course of devising the simulation model, basic communication theory is refined. The merging of communication networks and friendship networks leads to an explicit definition of publics as networks of co-attention between strangers that emerge when messages become public. The results show that recommender systems do not necessarily lead to strong fragmentation. The threat of filter bubbles arises if the pool of message content, and thus serendipity, is limited. <br />The model was developed with R and run on a high-performance cluster. R is an uncommon choice for agent-based-modeling. No dedicated ABM packages implementing parallel computing are available yet. The decision to use R and Tidyverse packages was made to test how feasible these components are for simulation models. On the one hand, the use of R instead of specialized simulation software is time-consuming in terms of development and computing time. On the other, the approach allows full control over the setup.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br />Many content analysis studies test hypotheses as to whether two constructs are correlated or not. The study uses Monte Carlo simulation techniques to estimate the minimum required levels of content analysis reliability for testing correlational hypotheses, depending on desired error probabilities, sample size, effect size. I introduce a web-based calculator, a downloadable calculator, and a set of tables and demonstrate how they can be used in designing, reporting, and evaluating content analysis studies. In most widespread sample sizes the rule-of-thumb that coding agreement should be greater than alpha=.80 and at the very least greater than .67 corresponds to the simulation results, resulting in acceptable alpha and beta error rates. However, in studies with low sample sizes and/or low expected effect sizes, alpha and beta error rates will be unreasonably high even if coding agreement is decent. In studies with high sample sizes and/or high expected effect sizes, coder agreement below .67 may still result in reasonable alpha and beta error rates. Beyond consideration in evaluation of studies, this can help in designing studies. Particularly in pre-registered research, higher sample sizes may be used to compensate for low expected effect sizes and/or borderline coding reliability (e.g. when constructs are hard to measure). However, researchers should better optimize their measurement instruments and only resort to boosting sample sizes if no other measures seem fruitful.\n","Abstract Body: The interplay between culture and network has aroused interests in both cultural sociology and cross-cultural psychology. Classic statements raised by Marx and Durkheim highlight the patterns of how social relations affect the composition of cultural systems. The other path led by Bourdieu and DiMaggio argues that cultural tastes and practices may also have an independent effect on social structure, which shed lights on how cultural resources (re)produce and alter network relations and how different cultural capital (elite culture and pop culture) transfers into social capital. This study contributes to these long-standing issues by specifying some of its underlying dynamics using a theoretical computer simulation, namely network agent-based modeling. We specifically focus on two fundamental questions of the culture-network interactions: How does cultural capital transform into social capital? How does different social context alter cultural consumption and its influence on social network formation?\n","Abstract Body: With over 5 million entries in the English language edition alone, Wikipedia is the world’s largest collaborative endeavor. However, equally well documented is Wikipedia’s gender problem: women make up only about 10% of editors (Wikimedia Foundation, 2011) and when it comes to biographical content, less than 20% of the articles are about women (Maher, 2018). This disparity has inspired several initiatives, like 500 Women Scientists and Art+Feminism, to work to close the gender gap on Wikipedia. Through in person Wikipedia trainings and edit-a-thons, these initiatives attempt to add women’s histories, legacies, and achievements to the world’s largest encyclopedia. This paper looks at over 5,000 Wikipedia biographical articles about women in order to estimate the impact of the feminist initiatives in bridging the gender gap. Through statistical description of quality indicators, network analysis of page links, and co-occurance network analysis of meta data features, this paper assesses the effectiveness of these interventions and, more generally, to determine how to improve the diversity and representativeness of digital collaborative systems.\n","Abstract Body: How do institutions and culture interact in online communities? Using data on the membership and governance styles of 5,000 small-scale amateur-run online community web servers, we construct empirical measures for cross-server similarities in governance and culture. These measures allow us to explore the emergence and evolution of each community’s institutional framework along two key dimensions: 1) the influence of its institutional environment on its culture, and 2) the influence of its culture on its institutional environment.<br />We study the joint effects of common culture (as proxied by common membership) and common institutions upon each other, using a large population of communities that provide the game <i>Minecraft<\/i>. To establish the relative importance of culture and institutions on each other, we construct multiplex networks of user migration patterns and rule similarities communities, linking communities that are more similar either in their user bases or governance. We then use a measure from network science, Multiplex Markov Chains, to assess the causal relationships between shared traffic patterns and governance choices. We first identify a fast-timescale trend from low to high similarity both in traffic and certain rule types. Following up with slower time-scale evidence, we disentangle the directionality of these effects to show that, while effects in both directions are evident, there is a much stronger role for institutions on culture than culture on institutions. Looking within the rule types that constitute a governance regime, we find that these processes are evident only within administrative and informational type rules, with no effect among communication or transaction rules.\n","Abstract Body: Online communities play a major role is structuring online experience, and modern life.  But the people who lead them are largely amateurs with no prior experience leading a group, making policy, or designing organizational processes. They are often unpaid and often unappreciated, but they persist, presumably out of sense of purpose, a purpose that aligns with the most utopian visions of the Internet as a tool for community empowerment. Understanding how and why volunteers lead communities can improve the role that small self-governing communities play on the Internet, while also improving our understanding of organizational processes, governance design, and online peer production.  <br />Leaders of online communities are literally engineering social systems, and they have all the flexibility afforded by code and the Internet to implement any organizational or political structure they can conceive of.  These explorations leave digital traces that make it possible to trace the developmental trajectories of many comparable communities, and even gain insight into the process of learning to engineer a governance institution.<br />Because governance is usually understood in terms of participation in formal “mass governance” institutions—from municipalities to nations—modern governance training is  professionalized and focused on the problems and approaches of this very indirect and impersonal type of governance. Although there is a literature on the development of policy processes (Sabatier & Weible, 2014), this context has not motivated an interest in how bureaucrats learn to govern, likely because there is no reliable signal to learn from: policy making in mass governance contexts rarely makes it possible to rigorously determine whether a policy was even effective, and what signals are available may take years.  Approaching our domain from another direction, literatures on organizational and institutional dynamics give insight into how social systems evolve (Aldrich, 1999; Ostrom, 2009). However, again, these tend to be large, amorphous, polycentric, or otherwise complex systems in which what change there is was rarely the intended result, the only result, and entirely caused by a single lead designer’s direct actions. MOre often the object of study in organizational and institutional dynamics is hard-to-detect endogenous processes relating the actions of many kinds of agents throughout an organization.  For example, James March and other explore the evolution of the policy structure of Stanford University, showing how the efforts of different committees in different institutional contexts set different kinds of rules into an evolutionary dynamic (March et al. 2000). Although it has many links, our question is most relevant to one literature in particular: research on building online communities, which have tackled the engineering side, the organizational side, and key questions about membership rules (Kraut & Resnick, 2012), but have not attended to the important question of what an amateur leader initially believes a community needs, how a community leader revises that belief over time, or what that revision looks like.<br />We follow a population of online communities from birth to maturity, tracking the evolving governance styles of their administrators as they learn, or don’t learn, to create institutional structures that foster an engaged devoted core group of followers. What is the difference between what an amateur administrator thinks is effective and what proves to be effective?  What distinguishes the many aspiring community leaders who fail from the few who succeed?<br />In particular, we focus on administrators who host small-scale instances of the multiplayer virtual world Minecraft. Minecraft is a popular game whose internals are of less concern here than its ecosystem.  The community of developers around Minecraft made it possible for anyone to privately serve an instance of the game. There are now hundreds of thousands of these servers around the world, and when players log in to play with others, they tend to log in to one of these private servers. Some are run for profit, but the subset we focus on seem to be run for the sake of building a devoted community of players with common interest in collaborating within the game. Another important aspect of the Minecraft ecosystem is that players can install software modifications, “plugins”, that automate governance activities.  Plugins have thus helped reduce the design of a governance system in Minecraft to the flipping on or off of various switches, one to turn market exchange on or uncivil communication off. These are important because building a successful Minecraft community means overcoming several daunting collective action challenges, a task that is much more approachable with the help of governance plugins. This work focuses on four categories of plugin with a particular focus on governance: plugins that further empower the administrator, those that make it easier to provide information to the user community, those that facilitate market exchange, and those that improve peer-to-peer communication. These are the admin, info, economy, and chat plugins referred to in our figures.<br />We tracked 3314 small-scale Minecraft servers that existed for at least four months, some with four months of success, and some without any persistent user community (we also followed additional filtering decisions introduced in Frey & Sumner, 2019, who provided the dataset). We made this population the basis of a “population-level” comparative analysis at the unit of analysis of the social system.  Population-level analysis is an important new approach in computational methods that is providing new strategies for gaining mechanistic insights into the processes of emergence and adaptation in social systems (Hill & Shaw 2017). Looking at servers that we believe first went live during the data collection process, we looked at each server’s “portfolio” of governance plugins by governance type (a histogram of plugins by type).  We then examined those communities four months later, to look for changes in their portfolio. Comparing these portfolios before and after several months of governance experience, we propose to make inferences about the average administrator’s process of learning to govern. Next we split our data between those administrators who ultimately build successful online communities and those who do not, where success is defined as having more than one player who visited the community at least once a week for a month. In other words, success means building a core group greater than one. This bar may sound low, but it is difficult, fewer than a third of communities in our dataset exceed it.  Differences between successful and unsuccessful administrators in the difference-over-time (month 4 portfolio - month 1 portfolio) can give us insight into what distinguishes the successful learners from the unsuccessful. Furthermore, differences in governance style between these two types of administrator at month 1 can tell us whether prior beliefs in what constitutes effective governance affect success.<br />Results<br />Our main finding is that there is a consistent difference across plugin types in the median number of plugins that a month-1 and month-4 server administrator uses (Figure 1). Overall, administrators tend to focus on plugins that concentrate and amplify their own ability to govern directly. Administrators’ priors about effective governance in this community seem to align with empirically effective governance: prior work on this same population finding that reliance on that same plugin category is significantly correlated with community success, particularly as communities get larger (Frey & Sumner, 2019).  <br />In addition to raw counts, we also examined relative proportions of plugins by type to ask whether administrators learned to favor one over another type of governance with time. We find no difference in the relative proportions of plugin types between months 1 and 4 (Figure 2), suggesting that all learning that we can observe was focused around doing more of the same: using a greater quantity of plugins of the same type rather than different types of plugins. <br />Last, we investigated the difference between administrators who ultimately built a successful community and those who did not (Figure 3).  We gained several insights from this comparison. Post hoc successful administrators do not differ in the relative proportions of plugin types they rely on (they do not favor one type of governance more than unsuccessful administrators). Nor do they differ in their learning rate: the difference in number of plugins installed between months 1 and 4 is the same between successful and unsuccessful administrators.  The only difference we detect that can distinguish successful administrators from the unsuccessful is that post hoc successful administrators found their communities with more plugins installed. The interpretation we favor is that the major difference between a successful and unsuccessful administor in Minecraft is prior beliefs about governance intensity, with unsuccessful administrators underestimating the degree of governance intensity required of a successful community. If this is true, then it may be possible to increase the rate on online community success merely through education campaigns focused on amending the beliefs of would-be administrators. Of course, there may be other explanations for this effect. For example there may be an effect of chance.  Plugins are easy to install, and it is as easy to install many as few. If more plugins is better, then a chance administrator who accidentally installs more plugins will be more likely to build a successful community. Additionally, this finding does not tell us why having more rules in the beginning leads to success. Perhaps the reason is substantive: starting a community with more rules in place makes it more likely that community members will internalize behavior that ensures community success. Alternatively, perhaps having more rules is merely a symptom of having a more invested leader. <br />Conclusion <br />We investigate what people who run online communities learn as they gain experience.We find that they learn to install more rules over time, and that more successful communities had more rules in the beginning. Overall, we suggest that amateur leaders of online communities underestimate the amount of formal structure that an online community requires to succeed. In addition to what it says about learning, this finding may speak to theories of state formation in political theory, bureaucratization in sociology, or formalization in organization theory, and may serve to guide in the design and analysis of governance institutions.<br /><br />References<br />March, J.

If the work they choose doesn’t align with the goods people want and need, the result is “underproduction”—some widely consumed materials end up relatively neglected and lower quality than one might expect given their critical nature. Past research has examined volunteer motivation in these projects and found competing explanations for production choices. We theorize that most participants’ initial participation is driven by personal interests and aligned with popular demand. Editors who persist are motivated by social connections and concentrate their efforts in “overproduced” areas. We use a detailed longitudinal dataset and find three trends consistent with our theory: as contributors accumulate experience, they are less likely to contribute to underproduced materials, and contributors who prefer underproduced materials are less likely to persist in contributing. These relationships are weaker among contributors who do not create social identities for themselves.\n","Abstract Body: This project aims to offer systematic evidence on whether incivility increased on social media over the past years and across the various types of groups (political, non-political, and mixed; politically homogenous, heterogenous; liberal, conservative; and ten categories of non-political groups) by using Reddit comments from 2006 to 2019, and using a combination of computational methods, such as machine learning and natural language processing and traditional statistic inference methods.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Estimating the political orientation of citizens has always been a crucial task in communication as well as political science studies. With the explosive growth of Online Social Networks (OSNs) in the last two decades this task has gained even higher importance because the algorithms OSNs use to deliver content to their users are blamed for echo chamber formation and increase in political polarization. To study these two phenomena, namely, echo chambers and political polarization, on OSNs one needs to efficiently estimate political orientation of online users. In this study, advanced network analysis tools are developed to tackle this task. Specifically, using network embedding algorithms, friendship networks are embedded into lower-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving specific topological features of social networks. The resulting embedded vectors are then used to estimate certain personal traits of users including their political orientation. The developed tools are applied to a benchmark data set as well as a Twitter data set acquired by the authors. Our model decreased the mean absolute error (MAE) of the state-of-the-art predictions on the benchmark income data set by 15%. The developed tools have multiple use cases, for example, studying echo chambers and political communication on OSNs and also in marketing campaigns.\n","Abstract Body: The network analysis method has been adopted to explore the social media data for more than twenty years. Prior research identifies two basic approaches in social network analysis: ego-centric and socio-centric network analysis. Although a batch of prior studies has successfully employed the socio-centric network approach to understand the structures of certain topic-networks or membership networks on social media, it is commonly found that the results of these networks were largely context-based or event-based. To understand the general patterns of how common users cluster on social media, we need socio-centric networks of social media users with larger boundaries.This paper proposed a data collection strategy to scrap the networks at a national level. Specifically, we choose the South Korea as the case of the nation and scrap the socio-centric network of South Korea on one of the most popular social networking services-- Twitter. We further proposed two approaches to validate our data collection results and described the topology patterns of the South Korean Twitter user network.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This project analyzes duplicate accounts, also known as sybils, in networks. People may use duplicate accounts for multiple reasons, including impression management and privacy. Within computer science, past work on sybils revolves around how to detect malicious sybils. Using data provided through a partnership with the game developer Wargaming.net, we analyzed sybil accounts in the network of players of their game <i>World of Tanks <\/i>to see the effect of merging parent and child accounts on the global network. While the impact of this merging was less than anticipated, in the future we will analyze the ego networks of the parent and child accounts. We will also study behavioral dynamics of these accounts through a supervised machine learning approach. Communications scholars will benefit from this work as this interdisciplinary scope would provide insight into other networked environments such as social media and commercial organizations.\n","Abstract Body: Moral conflicts are central to narratives, but no methodology exists for extracting and analyzing moral conflicts from narratives at scale. In this paper, we present a computational approach to identifying moral conflicts in movie scripts. Drawing from graph theory, we introduce narratives as dynamically evolving relationships between characters and focus on character network modularity and linguistic analysis as promising means for moral conflict detection. We evaluate the performance of our approach on a set of three popular movies, demonstrating that this method can accurately identify scenes that are rich in moral conflict between characters. We provide a theoretical integration of our method into the larger milieu of storytelling and entertainment research, illuminating future research trajectories at the intersection of computational communication research, media psychology, and movie performance modeling.\n","Abstract Body: Topic modeling has become an increasingly popular set of methods in computational social science. While some argue that its role is to supplement existing methods, others strive to improve the reliability and validity of the method. Our paper contributes towards a better understanding of the reliability of topic models in two ways: (1) we test the effects of document- and term-filters on the stability of the topic modeling solutions; (2) we propose new measures for assessing the reliability of different solutions: topic similarity, degrees of topic matching, unique topics, and time series variability. The effects we find are extreme: the topic modeling solutions are fundamentally influenced by text preprocessing decisions, so that two solutions are only recognizable as being based on the same material if the preprocessing decisions were very similar. Often, a single “topic” in one solution splits into several “topics” in another solution. However, a vague connection between the topics can be drawn in most constellations, but clearly identifying issues as “similar” or “equivalent” is often not possible.\n","Abstract Body: Sentiment (or tone, valence) is central to many studies of political and strategic communication. Automatic sentiment analysis, however, is difficult due to the inherent subjectivity and domain- and content-specific language use. Many studies have relied on dictionaries of positive and negative terms, either generic dictionaries such as LIWC or domain-specific dictionaries such as the Loughran and McDonald (2016) dictionary for financial news. The validity of these dictionaries is very limited, however, as dictionaries do not correlate well with each other or with human expert coding (see e.g. Soroka et al., 2015; Gonzalez-Bailon & Paltoglou, 2015; Boukes et al., 2019). Thus, many scholars advocate using crowd coding, machine learning, and/or domain and task-adapted dictionaries. It is unclear, however, which of these techniques are appropriate for what tasks, and what level of validity can be attained at what human effort. In this paper, we will compare these techniques on a single data set and show how crowd coding, machine learning, and domain adaptation interact. We compare the results of several different ways of doing sentiment analysis, from manual coding with trained coders and crowd coding to classical and `deep learning' machine learning and various dictionaries, including automatic translation. All methods were compared to a gold standard, showing that (1) trained human coding is still best; (2) crowd coding comes very close at a fraction of the cost and hassle of trained coding; (3) dictionaries perform only slightly better than chance; and (4) especially deep learning outperforming  dictionaries, but still performing substantially worse than human coding. This comparison gives insight into the state of the art in sentiment analysis and helps practitioners choose the technique that matches their research question (and budget)\n","Abstract Body: This research explores the role of Twitter during and in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, how Twitter is used in making calls for help and rescue, and how we automate the detection of tweets relevant to first responders. More specifically, we present a labeling scheme to categorize tweets based on relevancy and urgency and develop machine learning models to classify tweets related to Hurricane Harvey. Our best relevance classifiers, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), capture a larger fraction of relevant tweets than existing non-neural classifiers but underperform compared to CNNs trained to perform a simpler classification task. Although the unbalanced nature of the urgency dataset leads to mediocre model performance, we illustrate the benefit of SVM-SMOTE oversampling in improving classifier performance on unbalanced disaster datasets. Ultimately, this study furthers crisis communication research by developing a method to automatically categorize Twitter communication that can be used to signal to first responder operations of individuals’ requests for help in urgent, life-threatening disaster situations.<br /> <br /><br /> <br />\n","Abstract Body: The goal of this paper is to evaluate two different methods for topic modeling of multilingual document collections: (1) machine translation (MT), and (2) a dictionary approach to code words to concepts prior to topic modeling (DC). We empirically assess the consequences of these approaches – involving qualitative validation and quantitative comparison – and highlight the potentials and weaknesses of each method. For our case study we use a data set of tweets in three languages (English, Hebrew, Arabic) focusing on the ongoing local conflicts between Israeli authorities, settlers and Bedouins in the West Bank. Comparing the two methods we find a large share of equivalent topics in both models unambiguously outlining the debate over the conflict and violent events. Beyond the commonalities, the DC model delivers a slightly more nuanced picture of the conflict-related topics, while the MT model obscures some nuances and offers substantively peripheral topics (such as weather and religious talk) instead. Our study is a first step towards instrument validation, indicating that both methods yield valid, exploitable results.\n","Abstract Body: With global media content databases and online content being freely available, analyzing topical structures in different languages simultaneously has become an urgent computational task. Some previous studies have analyzed topics in a multilingual corpus by translating all items into a single language using a machine translation service such as Google Translate. We argue that this existing method is not reproducible in the long run and propose a new method - Reproducible Extraction of Cross-lingual Topics using R (rectr). Our method utilizes open-source aligned word embeddings to understand the cross-lingual meanings of words and has a mechanism to normalize residual influence from language differences. We present a benchmark that compares the topics extracted from a corpus of English, German and French news using the new method with those from an existing method in the literature (translated structural topic modeling, or tSTM). We show that our method is not only reproducible, but can also generate high quality cross-lingual topics. We demonstrate how our method can be applied in tracking news topics across time and languages.\n","Abstract Body: Communication research has long been criticized for over-fragmentation. In this paper, we do not aim to provide a solution for unification, but rather show that the field may have maintained a healthy balance between specialization and integration. A bibliographic dataset of more than 50,000 articles from all SSCI-indexed communication journals during the past 50 years is analyzed. The results show that journals have spontaneously organized themselves into either “vertical” domains representing subfields or “horizontal” foundations transcending subfields. Multiple subfields have emerged over time, but the level of diversification stayed stable. Moreover, the field has also generally agreed on a set of common intellectual roots, i.e., the wide citations of a limited set of sources. Afterall, diversity may not be a sin for the field. What we should do next is to use the latest specialized knowledge to feed the ongoing integrative efforts and let the latter to guide the former.\n","Abstract Body: Making Sense of Trace Data<br />In this abstract we discuss the development of an application web scraper and the subsequent challenges that came with such development due to (1) the inherent temporality of web repositories and their potential negative effects on data quality and (2) possible biases introduced by the platform architecture and marketing practices where these applications reside.<br />One of the main objectives of our scraper was to deal with the inherent temporality of web data and app marketplaces. Not only do apps gradually disappear from depositories, but subtle name changes and the existence of legacy versions complicate matters further. While Google Play serves as the golden standard for Android applications, the information-value of this repository diminishes rapidly as the age of the historical data increases. Previous research estimated that around 50% of apps receive an update in the Play store over a period of six months (Comino, Mamenti & Mariuzzo, 2018) and Viennot, Garcia & Nieh (2014) found that about 7% of all scraped apps in the Play Store were deprecated after two months. However, given that the distribution of app popularity on these platforms is heavily skewed, with only a small subset of extremely popular apps and a large subset of apps with just a few downloads (Zhong & Michahelles, 2013), it is likely that these calculations overestimate the potential performance drops in a realistic research context. We aim to add to these insights by considering potential performance drops with actual mobile phone usage data. Moreover, we go beyond Google’s Play Store and additionally use alternative repositories. Such repositories are often less well-maintained and thus contain information on legacy versions and deprecated Google Play apps.<br /><br />Developing a Sequential App Scraper<br />The need for meta-data concerning applications arose when we started working with smartphone logs obtained from the Mobile DNA research project (see Van Damme, Martens, Van Leuven, Vanden Abeele & De Marez, 2019). Using this tool, we obtained more than 202 million application logs from 14.426 individuals for a period between January 2018 and September 2019. During that period, 50.218 different Android applications were used.<br />In order to collect meta-data for these apps, we used a sequential scraping strategy. Using the Rvest package (Wickham, 2019), the script fetched information from five different online sources in a successive manner. The order was determined by the level of detail provided by the source, although the availability of the app category (i.e. social, communication, game) was a prerequisite for all platforms to be eligible for inclusion in our sample. Moreover, platforms that had a predictable URL-structure for their app-pages (e.g. www.apkmonk.com/app/<i>packagename<\/i>) were preferred, unless they contained less metadata. If the website contained an unpredictable URL-structure, all package names were automatically queried through the Bing search engine to obtain the appropriate URL before scraping their corresponding app-page. The script could scrape multiple URLS if the metadata was spread out across multiple pages on any specific website.<br />Given these selection criteria, app-pages were scraped from the following repositories (in order): (1) Google Play, (2) apkmonk, (3) APK Support, (4) APKsHub and (5) APKPure. Applications that were unavailable on any of these online platforms were matched with a freely available dataset of 48.000 scraped apps from the Kaggle-repository which was uploaded on December 2018. For applications that were still not found using the previous steps, we used a pattern matching procedure. For instance, if an application contained the substring ‘game’, we categorized it as a gaming application. A summary of all the steps taken by the scraper can be found in <i>Figure 1<\/i>. A list of the scraped variables and a comparison between the different app repositories can be found in <i>Table 1<\/i>.<br /><br />These initial results shed some light on the temporality of these online repositories. Given their strict maintenance-policy, we expected that the Google Play library was more likely to contain metadata on recently developed applications. <i>Figure 2<\/i> displays the percentage of apps found on the Play Store according to the date they first appeared during data collection. We aggregated all new applications on a week-level basis. Our analysis confirmed our expectations. While more than 4 out of 5 apps introduced recently to our dataset were present in the Play Store, apps appearing for the first time between the first half of 2018 have a detection rate of around 70%. This constitutes a performance drop of approximately 10 to 15% in 1 year. <i>Table 2<\/i> gives an overview of the mean detection rate by month based on daily detection rates.<br />Despite the sequential scraping strategy, several alterations to the originally scraped data were necessary to ensure the consistency and validity of the data. First, app categories were harmonized across the different repositories as most platforms adopt the Google Play categorisation. Second, we performed a fuzzy matching procedure to detect undetected legacy versions, regional versions or certain sub-processes of already detected apps. To accomplish this, we calculated a similarity matrix (based on the Jaro metric) between apps that were present versus not present in the online repositories. Subsequently, we coupled each missing app with its closest match. Although one could opt for an automated matching procedure, we preferred to manually check all matches with a Jaro similarity of at least 0.80. Apps matched through this approach adopted all metadata from their related app. Next, we performed what we coin as basematching. This technique follows a similar procedure as fuzzy matching, but only considers the root name of the application (e.g.‘com.<i>ea<\/i>. tetrisfree_row’, ‘com.<i>ea<\/i>.gp.starwarsbfcompanion’ both refer to EA games). This allowed us to infer the appropriate application category.<br />Next we employed two procedures that implied significant manual labour. First, we used the temporary results of the app scraper on a subset of around 100 million smartphone logs to produce a summary table of the most popular apps by category. We investigated the top 100 most popular apps for each category, including the missing applications. This procedure allowed us to identify the most prevalent and impactful inconsistencies in app categorisation, which yielded several significant findings. Most strikingly, dating apps belonged to both the ‘lifestyle’ (e.g. Tinder) or ‘social’ (e.g. Grindr) category. This is a prime example of biases introduced by marketing practices. Developers who wish to avoid any relation to the stigmatized dating app category tend to promote their product as a lifestyle app. Previous research already uncovered how Tinder successfully adopted such a marketing strategy to broaden their consumer base (Ranzini & Lutz, 2015). We recoded all these apps into a separate dating category. Moreover, the categorisation of common communication-related apps was plagued with inconsistencies. More specifically, web browsers were classified in the ‘communication’, ‘tools’ or ‘productivity’ categories. The same kind of inconsistencies popped up for mailing and music & video apps. We employed a pattern matching strategy to reassign these apps if necessary. Next, our inspection of the most prevalent apps in the missing-category allowed for the detection and categorisation of common system applications. Processes responsible for handling phone calls, dialers, text messages and the Android menu screen were coded in this manner. Our second labour-intensive procedure addressed a systemic flaw within the Google Play architecture. More specifically, all apps within the ‘sports’ category had to be manually recoded since they both contained sport games and other related sport applications such as news apps about a specific discipline (e.g. soccer). It turned out that 35% of all sport apps were mobile games. An overview of all alterations and the number of apps impacted can be found in <i>table 3<\/i>. Summary statistics on the final output of the app scraper can be found in <i>table 4.<\/i><br /><br />Challenges and Pitfalls – The Gains and Costs of Scraping<br />All in all, the web scraper described here solves some issues stemming from the inherent temporality of web data. Although a large majority of the apps in our sample (75%) were successfully scraped from the preferred Google Play platform, we had to rely on less reliable and information-rich libraries for about 1 out of 5 (18%) apps. Using these and other matching strategies, we reduced the number of apps with missing data from 25% (only using Google Play) to less than 6%. However, this exercise revealed some challenges related to the reliability and validity of any potential app scraper. First of all, the temporality of these web repositories remains a matter of concern. Even during our limited time period of around 1.5 years, the performance of the Google Play scraper dropped with around 10 to 15%. Although this is far less than one would expect based on Viennot and colleagues’s estimates (2014), this issue becomes only more pressing as the age of the data under study increases. This is especially worrisome given that one of the perceived promises of digital trace data is the ability to observe longitudinal trends in human behaviour (Lazer et al., 2009; Chang, Kauffman & Kwon, 2014). However, given our reliance on secondary data sources, the social scientist is often confronted with digital traces ‘after the fact’; collected and stored for entirely different – often commercial - purposes. So, while our results suggest that continuously and periodically scraping metadata from the onset of data collection is desirable, many research contexts won’t even allow for such a protocol to begin with.<br />Second, our results suggest that a fully automated app scraper is bound to be error-prone. App categories need to be harmonized manually and fuzzy or base-matching requires human judgement as well. While the absolute numbers of apps impacted by the fuzzy-and basematching procedure might appear to be low, apps can have a disproportional impact on coding and – ultimately – research results precisely because a handful of apps tend to dominate a user’s app repertoire (Jung, Kim & Chan-Olmsted, 2014). For example, the legacy version of Facebook was picked up by our fuzzy-matcher.<br />Third, app repositories other than the Play store tend to alter their website’s appearance and functions regularly. This does not only put an expiration date on the scraper itself, since these changes to the website might ‘break’ the script; but the information-richness of these app libraries might even change as well. This happened between the development and data collection phase of our own app scraper. More specifically, while the apkmonk and APK Support repositories offered very similar information categories during the development phase of our scraper, APK Support has expanded the available metadata for a substantial amount of applications a few weeks after the developing phase. However, since we’ve randomly picked apkmonk as the repository that should be scraped <i>before <\/i>APK Support, our code became de facto subpar from one day to the next.<br />Finally, our check on face validity revealed some potential sources of biases. Especially problematic in this regard is the far-reaching influence of the Play store’s platform architecture. More specifically, the predefined app categorisations by Google are – for the most part – adopted by all other app marketplaces. While this eased the harmonisation of app categories among different repositories, conceptually this classification scheme is rife with ambiguity. Most visibly, the sports category contained both sports games and general sports apps. Moreover, the distinction between the sports and health & fitness category remains unclear. For example, while ‘Strava’ – a popular fitness tracker – is categorized in the health & fitness category, a similar app called ‘Start 2 Run’ has been categorised by the developers as a sports app. This brings us to the second point of concern: biases introduced by marketing. By definition, of course, both the constraints of the Google Play platform and the agency of developers define the confines in which user experience can take place. Such negotiated agencies between platform, investors and users is characteristic of practically all digital platforms today (e.g. see Courtois & Timmermans, 2018). However, biases by developers are introduced when they misrepresent the intended purpose of the app to, for example, avoid the negative social connotations related to the app category. These biases were especially prevalent among the different dating apps in our sample. Academic research should be wary of such practices when adopting commercially inspired categorizations.\n","Abstract Body: The computational turn in communication research has given impetus to a new way of studying media effects. One data scientific method that appears particularly promising for the study of such effects is machine learning. Machine learning algorithms and statistical models are data analytic tools that are mathematically similar but serve different purposes. In this article, we highlight the main differences between these two approaches, and discuss the issues and challenges associated with machine learning in media effects research. To illuminate our arguments, we discuss a research question that is currently the focus of several media effects studies, namely whether smartphone use impacts wellbeing.\n","Abstract Body: Sampling content on social media is often done through the programming interfaces (APIs) of the platforms, where researchers only have limited access to and knowledge of the mechanisms by which the platforms provide them with the data they analyze. One of the, as of yet, understudied problems with sampling on social media are the effects of deleted content. The present study gives a brief overview of the current technical situation of data access on Twitter and an illustration of possible distortions and biases due to the prevalence of deleted content. With two datasets consisting of N = 2,008,359 and N = 84,771 tweets, empirical evidence for these biases in the context of real-world analysis are shown. The study finds significant differences in the prevalence of deleted content regarding both the content- and agent-level. Deleted tweets seem to be equivalent to survey data that is <i>missing not at random<\/i> (MNAR). Thus, knowledge about this hidden sampling bias is a methodological necessity.\n","Abstract Body: While everyday visual expression has always been part of social media (Burgess 2006), we are in the midst of an emphatic visual turn (Highfield & Leaver, 2016). A key feature of visual social media is the convergence of everyday, mundane expression with professional creative practice and advertising: the distinctions between vernacular and commercial culture have become profoundly blurred (Burgess 2015, Banet-Weiser 2012, Abidin 2016). In platforms like Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, advertising content, social media influencers, and everyday consumer engagement with brands mix with family photos, art photography, and the documentation of everyday life. Platforms coordinate and mediate these everyday promotional cultures as part of their strategic effort to generate and sell attention and data (Anonymous, 2018).<br />Despite the clear interest for communication research, Instagram’s significantly large and engaged user base and distinctive everyday visual cultures have eluded intensive study due to the scarcity of methods for data collection and analysis. The programs of leading conferences and journals illustrate a bias towards verbal and written communication over visual culture, with many more studies published on Twitter than on Instagram and other visually-driven social platforms (Ruths & Pfeffer, 2014). Yet, with one billion active users who share 100 million photos and generate 4.2 billion ‘likes’ per day, Instagram has a significantly larger and more engaged user base, and higher brand engagement (a key indicator of platform durability) than Twitter. Instamancer addresses this critical methodological gap.<br />Instamancer is an Instagram data gathering tool developed for collecting and processing public Instagram posts and media files without requiring login to Instagram, nor access to a Server-side web API. In this demo we will assist participants in downloading and installing Instamancer, explore the functionality of the software, and also showcase analytical pipelines we have developed for assisting in the analysis of gathered data. We strongly advocate for ethics in social media research and will also discuss relevant considerations relating to user rights and privacies (Markham & Buchanan 2012)<br /><br />The APIocalypse<br />The gathering of media objects through computational means is a constantly evolving space for researchers. Over the past almost two decades we have seen the rise in use and prominence of 3<sup>rd<\/sup> party Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) which up until recently have allowed researchers, and indeed anyone with the right knowledge and technical support to gather vast quantities of social media data from platforms that provisioned such services. In the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and indeed even before this moment, the ability to locate and download social media trace data via these 3<sup>rd<\/sup> party APIs has been significantly restricted, and in some cases (e.g. Facebook) removed entirely. Note that we make a distinction here between the 3<sup>rd<\/sup> party API, and API in the general software design sense. This is an important distinction as many scholars refer to 3<sup>rd<\/sup> party APIs as ‘API’ or ‘The API’, as in ‘the Facebook API was just shut down’. This can be confusing in the context of web scraping as most web scrapers make use of APIs, but not 3<sup>rd<\/sup> party APIs. In this paper API refers to the general form of the Application Programming Interface which is a commonly used web design, for example Browser APIs are built into modern web browsers to allow the rendering of images, or playing of audio from web sites. Like most modern websites, Instagram employs an API as part of its web architecture, but does not expose a 3<sup>rd<\/sup> party Server-side web API like Twitter does.<br />In this current moment there is a call for a rebirth of methods that were once standard fare for Internet research, such as web scrapers (Freelon, 2018). Web scrapers, while often more technically complicated, provide researchers with the means to systematically collect social media data that can inform critically important communication research. In post-API research (Freelon, 2018) these techniques are seen by some as nefarious (Puschmann, 2019). Where the API provided a form of (perceived or real) legitimacy in obtaining large swathes of social media content, we now see objections that position scrapers as somehow less legitimate, despite both allowing for practically identical data collection, and in the case of web scrapers often of lower volume, and restricted to public data only. We argue that as critical communication researchers our primary concern should always center most directly on users, not platforms. Like Bruns (2019), we contend that unless highly opaque multi-national media organisations provide researchers the means to conduct open research on their functions, practices and social impacts, which as much research has revealed are often highly immoral, and in some cases illegal, then we have little choice left, and perhaps even a duty, to conduct research through alternative means.<br /><br />Instamancer<br />Instamancer is a data scraping tool that we have developed for supporting Instagram research projects. While there are many Instagram scrapers available, most use a browser to access a web-page and read the Document Object Model (DOM), or manually re-implement the requests that browsers make to an API endpoint. This is less than ideal because reading the DOM ignores some information that is only stored in memory, and re-implementing requests requires the deciphering and reproduction of pagination and authentication mechanisms. Both these methods don’t easily tolerate changes to the web front and back ends meaning that any changes that Instagram make to their web services can break the scraping approach, or information can become lost or corrupted in the process of scraping.<br />Instamancer is unique because it doesn’t read data from the DOM or reimplement API requests. Using the Puppeteer library it controls an instance of the Chrome web browser which interacts directly with web pages on instagram.com using simulated keyboard and mouse input. Using a feature unique to Puppeteer, requests made to the API by the page's JavaScript are intercepted and data from the responses is collected. This makes it much better at withstanding regular changes to the web interface and API, as it is simulating the way a regular user interacts with the website but is still collecting raw data from the API in full.<br />Instamancer also implements an innovative software method we call ‘grafting’ to assist with scraping large volumes of data. A perennial problem with scraping is consumption of large amounts of memory in large scraping jobs by browser-bound methods. In grafting, the scraper intercepts and saves the URL and headers of each request, and then after a certain number of interactions with the page it will restart the browser and navigate back to the same page. Once the page initiates the first request to the API, its URL and headers are swapped (grafted) on-the-fly with the most recently saved ones. Scraping continues without incident because the response from the API is in the correct form despite being for the incorrect data.<br />Another specific feature to scraping Instagram is how it sends limited information through its feed API. To get extra metadata such as the tagged users, and comments, Instamancer can open new tabs for each post that it scrapes, and then read the metadata from memory. In modern web applications like Instagram, there is an invisible state held in memory that is not necessarily being reflected in the rendered text at any given moment. By accessing this memory Instamancer can reveal processes and data that are building that internal state by fetching data from the API. Older scraping techniques do not do this, potentially missing important platform data.<br />From a practical perspective, Instamancer allows users to scrape Instagram images and metadata using hashtag, and user queries (until recently also geolocation, however this endpoint has now been removed by Instagram). The outputs are formatted as JSON and CSV, with images, albums, and videos downloaded in jpg and mp4 formats. The library can allow for batch scraping over several different queries.<br />Metadata that Instamancer is able to gather from posts includes:<br />Text<br />Timestamps<br />Tagged users<br />Accessibility captions<br />Like counts<br />Comment counts<br />Images (Thumbnails, Dimensions, URLs)<br />Videos (URL, View count, Duration)<br />Comments (Timestamp, Text, Like count, User)<br />User (Username, Full name, Profile picture, Profile privacy)<br />Location (Name, Street, Zip code, City, Region, Country)<br />Instamancer is an open-source tool, and is available for download via GitHub at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/2887c356-638d-46b3-bed6-eae5b1499d4a/<br /><br />References<br />Abidin, C.

This Rank Degree Influencer Core Sampler (RADICES) is based on the rank-degree method. This method has been shown to effectively retrieve highly influential spreaders for a wide range of network types with node-local information only, i.e., information that is available on Online Social Networks or subscription-based platforms at the account-level, namely, the number of followers or subscriptions. This enabled us to successfully test the developed tool in a study of the German-speaking Twittersphere. We will present the most important results of this study alongside a live-demonstration of the software, sampling follow networks around Twitter accounts that tweet about the ICA conference.\n","Abstract Body: This study provides a better understanding of whether YouTube functions as a deliberative forum for climate change issues. For this purpose, this study collected 19 most-viewed YouTube videos about the climate activist Greta Thunberg and analyzed users’ responses to them through a qualitative content analysis and topic modeling of the comments under the videos. We found that the majority of users relied on four types of attack discourse in their comments – (1) attacks on immaturity, (2) attacks on appearance and speech manners, (3) attacks on a personal matter (illness), and (4) manipulation. The attack discourse was full of uncivil language, suggesting that YouTube communication about Thunberg was far from deliberative discussion, and focused on invalidating Thunberg’s agenda and her credibility.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Recent research has suggested that using messages focused on the proximal impacts of climate change could encourage the public to take steps to address this important issue. One theory examining the importance of the proximity of issues such as climate change is Construal Level Theory (CLT). Within this area of research, the majority of studies have focused on the concept of psychological distance. However, few studies have examined other types of construals within the larger theory focused on this topic. Similarly, few studies have connected the extensive work on emotions with CLT. The purpose of this study is to map emotions onto Construal Level Theory and examine the relationships between psychological distance, emotions, and climate engagement. In addition, this study looks at different emotions serving as mediators in the process of encouraging the public to take action on climate change.\n","Abstract Body: Communication plays an important role in shaping people’s attitude and behaviors concerning climate change. Based on an experiment (N=225), this study examined the effect of information source, balance, and exposure frequency on people’s willingness to take actions against climate change. It was found that constant exposure can directly increase people’s willingness for climate mitigation actions. Information source, balance, and exposure can mutually influence people’s risk perception of climate change, which further influence their willingness to take actions against climate change. Implications and suggestions were discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study tests how different efficacy constructs – self efficacy, personal outcome expectancy, collective efficacy, and collective outcome expectancy – independently influence willingness to engage in personal energy conservation behavior, and support for policies to address climate change. Data from a cross-nationally representative European survey, European Social Survey Round 8, was analyzed to test the relationship. Overall, the results demonstrated that self efficacy, personal outcome expectancy, and collective outcome expectancy are all positively associated with both behavioral intention and policy support respectively. Results regarding collective efficacy were rather unstable. The results suggest the importance of clearly distinguishing different constructs of efficacy beliefs, and further offers insight into perceptions that should be particularly considered for efficacious climate change communication efforts.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Animal agriculture is a major producer of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to between 14.5 and 18 per cent of global emissions, which is more than the transportation sector  Global meat consumption is projected to grow, which will increase animal agriculture’s negative impact on the environment. Public awareness of the link between animal food consumption and climate change is low; this may be one of many obstacles to more effective interventions to reduce meat consumption in Western diets, which has been proposed by many research institutions. This study analyzes how much attention the UK and US elite media paid to animal agriculture’s role in climate change from 2006 to 2018. The results show that during that period, volume of coverage remained low, and that when the issue was covered, consumer responsibility was mentioned more than that of governments or large-scale livestock farms. In similar fashion, a range of options around personal dietary change was far more prominent in the media discussion of solutions than government policies, reforming agricultural practices or holding major animal food companies accountable for their emissions.\n","Abstract Body: Climate justice movements often discuss the Arctic in the contexts of climate change, environmental protection and indigenous rights. However, this study shows how certain socio-economic conditions produce a reverse hegemonic discourse whose logics limit the relevance of climate justice claims. Using the conceptual framework of poststructuralist discourse theory and critical media politics approach, this study highlights the attempt of Greenpeace Russia to use the 2016 anthrax outbreak on the Yamal peninsula in northwestern Siberia to dislocate and challenge the dominant media discourse. The paper reflects on how neo-authoritarian media does not see contradictions between environmental protection and economic development and fails to account for climate change problem in Russia’s fossil fuel economy. The climate justice discourse promoted by Greenpeace Russia did not only fail to introduce a valid unifying platform explaining the climate-related cause of the decease outbreak, but compromised its own campaign with inconsistent and controversial media statements.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Based on the theory of media system dependency, this study investigates how reliance on specific genres of news media (i.e., the environment vs. politics) influences the way people feel about an environmental risk, and how this in turn impacts policy preferences (i.e., punitive vs. preventive). Analysis of survey data conducted on the issue of air dust indicates that attending to scientific/environmental news is associated with greater anxiety and anger about the issue, whereas attending to political news is associated with fear and sadness/depression (as well as anxiety and anger). Feeling anxiety led to support for both punitive and preventive policies, while anger led to support only for punitive policy. Sadness did not independently predict any policy support intentions<i>.<\/i> Further, mediation test reveals that use of scientific/environmental news indirectly influences support for preventive policy through feelings of anxiety, whereas use of political news indirectly influences punitive and preventive policy support through anger and anxiety, respectively. The implications of the findings are discussed as cases of emotional effects of media dependency on public responses to environmental risks.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Dialogue-oriented debates between experts aim to introduce scientific facts into societal discourse, encourage expert-layperson communication, and help laypeople form opinions. Audience expectations are one factor in whether the format achieves these goals. Following the Theory of Subjective Quality Assessment (Wolling, 2004, 2009), we used real-time response (RTR) measurement and a pre-post survey (n=65) to investigate the following questions during an expert debate: a) what did the recipients expect of the experts? b) how did recipients evaluate the comprehensibility and competence of the experts? c) what linguistic and content-based factors influenced this evaluation? Our results suggest that recipients expected the experts to be comprehensible, professional, and credible. The more these expectations were fulfilled, the more the debate was positively evaluated by the recipients. The RTR measurement showed similar results: the recipients had largely positive evaluations of the experts’ comprehensibility and competence. These positive evaluations were associated with the experts’ use of short sentences, structured content, and drawing of connections to the everyday world of the recipients, as well as the avoidance of scientific jargon. The prior knowledge of individual recipients did not measurably influence their perceptions of the experts’ comprehensibility.\n","Abstract Body: Support for the Green New Deal dropped significantly and unexpectedly after the official swearing-in of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in early 2019. Why did this drop occur? My paper seeks to understand this question through a qualitative content analysis of news coverage. Through an in-depth analysis of discursive strategies, my study finds a surprising convergence in coverage across news source, irrespective of political leaning. Both the NYT and WSJ frame the Green New Deal as a dangerous policy proposed by a radicalized cohort of Millennial “others”. Instead of a detailed and accurate discussion of the proposed policy, both the NYT and WSJ feature stories that report how: (1) The Democratic party is being radicalized by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, (2) Millennials are too ill-informed, inexperienced, and indecent—moderation is desperately needed, (3) The climate tax is the only way forward. A discursive strategy of enemy formation is therefore ubiquitously and consistently employed by United States print journalists to cast Millennials as a dangerous \"\"other\"\"—effectively discrediting the viability of the Green New Deal.\n","Abstract Body: Despite scientific consensus that genetically modified (GM) food is safe to eat, the American public remains skeptical, with some segments asserting strong opposition to GM food. Interestingly, this skepticism does not fall along partisan or religious lines, as with other controversial science issues. This study investigates the proposed role of disgust in driving opposition to GM food, which is debated in the extant literature. By using physiological measures of disgust sensitivity, alongside self-report measures, this study provides greater understanding to the role that disgust plays in shaping public attitudes toward a range of food and health technologies. Our results suggest that disgust does play some role in driving skepticism toward GM food, but not other food and health technologies. However, the results also suggest that other, related, factors may be influential to GM attitudes, and discuss the possible roles of risk sensitivity, expressiveness, and perceptions of unnaturalness. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Public understanding of large-scale infrastructure projects is essential since those projects incorporate high-level social risk and may lead to social unease once dealt with improperly. It is of great necessity to figure out how people adopt certain information and form their attitude on those project. Social Q&A sites provide new space for the public to freely share their ideas and also for the researchers to explore public opinion. Our research is aimed to find out the information adoption mechanism of infrastructure projects. Taking Three Gorges Project as the case, our study explores factors influencing answer adoption under the topic on <i>Zhihu.com<\/i>, a leading social Q&A platform in China. Based on the theory of the Elaboration Likelihood Model, we propose a comprehensive framework to model the effects of multiple factors on information adoption. Regression results revealed that (1) answer adoption is significantly influenced by information richness, (2) content features including professionalism, personal experience, entertainment, and anti-stigmatization are significantly and positively related to information adoption and (3) source credibility and source attractiveness have a positive impact on information adoption.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: This qualitative discourse analysis is a framing study of mainstream news coverage of two environmental stories, the Keystone XL pipeline expansion and <i>Deepwater Horizon<\/i> sinking and underwater oil leak. Texts revealed six frames divided into two groups, according to frame promoters: supporters and critics of the status quo economy of natural resource extraction. Frames are placed on Corbett’s (2006) Spectrum of Environmental Ideologies; suggestions for refining the spectrum are made.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study explores the evolution of Chinese official media discourses on climate change. Climate reports from China’s flagship party paper <i>People’s Daily<\/i>, from the first global climate conference in 1995 onwards, are analyzed in terms of the underlying development ideas and framings of climate change. It is found that climate change received increasing attention, with the years 2007 and 2015 representing two historical hallmarks of reporting. In tandem, the official discourses underwent noticeable shifts, treating climate action no longer as a hindrance to economic growth, but an opportunity for sustainable economic development and further public engagement. What remained unchanged was the persistent emphasis on economic growth, the resort to technology as an ultimate solution, and the attribution of most responsibilities to the developed countries. The findings suggest that China’s approach to addressing climate change fits in with the development trajectory of an authoritarian emerging economy.\n","Abstract Body: Analyzing Facebook content produced by 289 global nonprofits from 18 countries, this study investigates how these NGOs frame climate change in their strategic messages. It found that the most popular protest frame was <i>diagnostic. <\/i>Of the three aspects of this environmental phenomenon, including <i>impact, action, <\/i>and <i>efficacy,<\/i> climate <i>action <\/i>was used most frequently, while <i>efficacy <\/i>was the least favorite. With regards to <i>temporality <\/i>of climate change impacts, messages refer to effects at the present time. In terms of <i>spatiality <\/i>of climate change impacts, the content focuses on all three levels <i>global<\/i>, <i>national, <\/i>and <i>local<\/i> levels. Responsibilities for taking actions are mostly attributed to individuals and governments instead of businesses. NGOs from developed countries are more likely than those from developing nations to discuss climate actions. They are also more likely to call on individuals to participate in political activities. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The complexity and multilateral impacts of climate change are difficult to comprehend, and to connect to one’s personal daily life. Solutions-oriented journalism could help to make climate change related issues more accessible and provide information on how to react to mitigate the consequences. This study tests the effects of solution frames in climate change news on environmental attitudes. Special focus is put on the questions if it matters <i>how<\/i> solutions are framed and if such solution frames have <i>more<\/i> impact for people who feel solidarity with an environmentally conscious trusted other. Based on an experiment (N = 374), moderated mediation analyses showed that a social progress solutions frame significantly increased efficacy perceptions, for respondents with higher interpersonal solidarity to an environmentally conscious trusted other. This consequently led to significantly more positive environmental attitudes. The results of the current study highlight the impact of environmentally conscious trusted others with a high level of concern about climate change, affecting individual perceptions and emotional responses to solutions-oriented news frames in the context of climate change coverage.\n","Abstract Body: The aim of this study was to examine how fear appeals (moderate vs. high) and temporal frames (proximal vs. distal) interactively influenced consumers' attitude and purchase intention in the framework of sustainable fashion advertising in China. For that purpose, empirical analyses were performed by collecting data from heterogeneous sample of 640 participants across Mainland China. Our research results unveiled several important correlations where the consumers who perceived sustainable fashion as an issue highly relevant to themselves expressed more favorable attitude toward the advertising that employed moderate-level fear appeals than that employed high-level fear appeals. Although the same correlation was absent among the consumers with low level of perceived personal relevance, they showed the most favorable attitude toward the brand when being exposed to moderate-level fear appeals with a distal frame, and the least favorable attitude toward the brand when being exposed to high-level fear appeals with a distal frame. We further explored the impact of perception of fear on consumers’willingness to pay more for sustainable fashion apparel. These research results carry several significant theoretical and practical implications that can be effectively used by scholars as well as sustainable fashion marketing professionals.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The debate about sustainability has recently gained momentum. However, the general public remains fairly uninformed to what extent the financial sector plays a paramount role in fighting climate change by moving capital to sustainable and green sectors. Hence, to bring about a broader economic change, the discussion about “sustainable finance” has to move from the elite circles to discussions and engagement among civic society. To do so, this paper synthesizes literature and empirical studies on environmental engagement and communication about climate change and provides ten propositions on how to strategically communicate sustainable finance to the broader public. In so doing, the recommendations are drawn from various disciplines (e.g., psychology, marketing, sociology, economics, communication) and cover aspects such as the communication of norms, identities, social status, incentives and feedback, role models, emotions, loss/gain frames, time frames, as well as the use of metaphors, storytelling, narratives and use of language. The ten propositions are not only embedded in evolutionary theories and approaches from psychology, they are also accompanied by hands-on examples for various stakeholders and advocates of sustainable finance.<br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> sustainable finance, strategic communication, public engagement, message framing, evolutionary theory, psychology, literature review\n","Abstract Body: While more and more people try to minimize their negative impact on the environment, many of these individuals perceive air travelling as desirable despite of its contribution to their carbon footprints. The tension between moral principles and actual behavior of flyers results in a so-called ‘flyer’s dilemma’. Advertising is believed to amplify this dilemma by triggering wishes for environmentally detrimental ways of life. While a large body of literature documents the impact of science communication on intentions to act more sustainably, the impact of advertising in general and flight advertising in specific is still underexplored. This between-subjects-design experimental study with a quota-based sample (<i>N<\/i> = 199) explored whether and how individuals morally disengage from the harmfulness of their flying-behavior due to exposure to advertising and counter-campaigns. Results indicate that flight advertising increases the moral disengagement strategy of neglecting the harm of flying for individuals low in climate change concern. In addition, both the ad group and a group exposed to the same flight ads and a counter-campaign engage in displacing responsibility to other actors. Moreover, we find that moral disengagement affects perceptions of the harmfulness of flying, flying intentions, and support for aviation policies.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: moral disengagement, flyers’ dilemma, experiment, climate change concern, advertising\n","Abstract Body: How to effectively communicate commitment to sustainability has been a great challenge for businesses. In this study, we distinguish between three dimensions of perceived sustainability and present a framework to recast sustainability communication metrics. The results demonstrate that the strength, magnitude, and mobilizability of perceived sustainability play important roles in sustainability communication. They effectively reduced over-consumption intentions directly. They also increase brand resonance and purchase intentions indirectly through perceived value. Theoretically, this study contributes to sustainability research, theorizing perceived sustainability and offering a framework that clarifies the mechanisms by which PS directly and indirect affects brands and intentions via perceived value.\n","Abstract Body: To respond to consumers’ rising concerns about environmental topics, the airline industry has increasingly implemented green advertising strategies. However, due to the immense environmental impacts of flying, most green advertising campaigns by airlines can be considered as “greenwashing” practices. This study investigated the effects of two types of greenwashed advertisements for airlines: ‘lesser of two evils’ and ‘compensation’. Following the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) we also looked at the moderating role of environmental knowledge. In an experimental study with a quota-based sample (<i>N<\/i> = 329), we randomly assigned participants either to one of the two greenwashing claims or a control group without green claims. Results indicated that lesser of two evils claims did not enhance greenwashing perceptions. However, compensation claims did, which consequently harmed brand outcomes and flying attitudes as well as intentions. Environmental knowledge did not moderate these effects. Implications for research on greenwashing strategies and conclusions for practitioners are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The effectiveness of an online political campaign is largely contingent on its ability to infuse the issue into public debate and discussion. Environmental protection organizations have taken to social media to raise awareness of environmental threats and promote threat-reducing behavior. The current study employs a social cognitive approach to examine discussion of social and political issues. An experimental design, incorporating Perception Analyzer feeling dials and cognitive mapping, was employed to test the indirect influence of an environmental advocacy video on an individual’s communicative behavior, both offline and online. Structural equation modeling was utilized to test a hypothesized model of cognitive processing. The results reveal that message elaboration, perceived persuasiveness, attention to the message, and schematic complexity play a vital role in promoting real-world political discussion and social media engagement.\n","Abstract Body: Politicization of science becomes more and more prevalent in the era of post-truth. Accordingly, this study examines the interaction between politicization and institutional trust in influencing publics’ risk perception and risk acceptance. Specifically, it investigates risk assessment of imported food from Fukushima among publics in three Chinese societies with various political context, namely Hong Kong, Mainland China and Taiwan. Result of surveys reveals that the causal chain model (risk perception mediates relationship between institutional trust and risk acceptance) is applicable in all places. Politicization moderates relationship between institutional trust and risk perception in Hong Kong; it also moderates relationship between institutional trust and risk acceptance in Hong Kong and Taiwan. The proposed moderated mediation model is supported in Hong Kong only.<br />In respect to the analysis results, further exploration of politicization in terms of its promoting and impeding effects is included. This study extrapolates that the promoting and impeding effect may not be binary mechanisms but influences different paths of the causal chain model independently. In particular, the path between institutional trust and risk perception is likely to be affected by its promoting effect while that between institutional trust and risk acceptance is subject to influence of its impeding effect. Future research continuing in this direction would shed new light on exposition of the role of politicization in publics’ risk assessment.\n","Abstract Body: Empowering ordinary citizens the capacity to deliberate is a core issue in science communication. Despite growing deliberative practices in developed nations, it is much less understood whether successful public deliberation can happen among populations who are impoverished and lack formal education in developing countries. This paper examines the quality of reasoning in a structured deliberation setting, Deliberative Poll, in Tamale, Ghana with a representative sample of citizens. Drawing upon discourse quality index and applying large-scale human coding and computational methods, this paper analyzed thousands of speech acts from deliberation transcripts. We found that when exposed to well- designed deliberative environments, marginalized populations engaged in thoughtful discussions with their peers on complex policy issues related to sustainable environment and food security. This paper contributes to our understanding about how to effectively foster public deliberation in the developing context and how to systematically measure and analyze the nuances of public reasoning on science.\n","Abstract Body: Maintaining clean air is essential for public health and environmental protection. Achieving clean air requires both comprehensive federal laws and individuals to modify behavior to reduce personal health risks from air pollution. This research examines whether perceptions of acute and chronic health concerns motivate individuals to take steps to reduce ambient air pollution. Specifically, this study tests the predictive power of selected components related to the Health Belief Model (perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, and cues to action) for air pollution mitigation behavior. Using stratified sampling, we surveyed 325 individuals from Northern Nevada where poor air quality poses a risk for vulnerable populations. Results of ordinal logistic analyses showed that experiencing mucous membrane symptoms (eye itching, nose irritation, and dry throat/ cough) positively and significantly predicted perceived severity. Additionally, those who reported higher levels of self-efficacy and education levels were more likely to engage with pollution-reduction behavior. In the discussion section, we suggest how this information can be leveraged to promote social responsibility and eco-friendly behavior.\n","Abstract Body: As nuclear power remains an ongoing controversy in contemporary society, it is crucial to understand how laypeople make sense of nuclear power by considering influences at both the cognitive and the social level. Using the lens of social representation theory, this study employed automatic content analysis to reveal the content, formation, and dynamic shifts of laypeople’s social representations concerning nuclear power as they were expressed in tweets and comments posted on Chinese social media platform Weibo from 2011 to 2018. This study found that laypeople in China regarded nuclear power predominantly as an energy source, and they focused on general knowledge regarding national development of nuclear power and related energy policies, which remained unchanged over the eight years. Additionally, they perceived risks of nuclear power to occur at an individual level while benefits occurring at a social level, and they showed a reluctant acceptance of nuclear power. Alternatively, laypeople also made sense of nuclear power by addressing its controversial nature, such as plant siting and nuclear accident causation, but these ideas varied according to the specific social contexts. To form these representations, laypeople anchored nuclear power within social/historical events, a preexisting knowledge system, and personal experience, objectifying nuclear power through familiar objects and verbal metaphors. Moreover, they created and shared these representations by transforming abstract scientific knowledge about nuclear power into common-sense information and by adopting consensual discourse like heterogeneous arguments, affective expression, and stories about nuclear power. These findings provide implications for understanding laypeople’s everyday knowledge of nuclear power and for designing effective communication strategies in line with laypeople’s actual understanding for popularizing science and communicating risk in terms of nuclear power.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: social representation; nuclear power; topic modeling; Chinese social media\n",null,"Abstract Body: We turned to PRT to examine how individuals respond to message (forceful language) and source features (trustworthiness, expertise, domineeringness) in energy and water conservation messages. Additionally, we examined how two individual variables – reactance proneness and issue involvement – moderate message processing. The data were partially consistent with the hypotheses across contexts. Only source domineeringness was positively related to freedom threat in the context of energy conservation. Moreover, three significant interactions prompt attention for future research: (a) an interaction between forceful language and expertise for water conservation, (b) an interaction between domineeringness and reactance proneness for energy conservation, and (c) an interaction between domineeringness and issue involvement for water conservation. We present theoretical implications for continuing research and practical message design advice on source selection and audience segmentation.\n","Abstract Body: Research has shown that conservatives are often more skeptical of science and technology than liberals. Yet, while the politicization of issues like climate change has been extensively studied, it is unknown whether this politicization pattern also extends to other emerging technologies that might also profoundly transform our society, such as self-driving cars, job automation, and facial recognition technology. Besides, political ideology is often studied as a single liberal-versus-conservative spectrum, but how distinct components of political ideology shape public perceptions of scientific issues is less understood. With a survey of 891 crowdsourced workers, we demonstrated how economic and social dimensions of ideology, such as social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and free-market belief, distinctly shape individuals’ reactions to a wide range of scientific issues that include both conventional scientific topics and emerging technologies. This study provides both a theoretical understanding of the politicization of science and practical guidance for communicating new technologies such as artificial intelligence in a polarized environment.\n","Abstract Body: As climate change threats are increasing across the world, climate-induced migration is receiving more attention, particularly in and around the global south. However, despite extensive media coverage of natural disasters attributed to climate change in places such as the United States, little work has examined public perceptions of the likelihood of climate-related migration among members of wealthy industrialized countries. This study utilizes a nationally representative sample of the US public (N = 1000) to explore these perceptions. Respondents were asked about the likelihood that they would have to migrate to avoid the harms of climate change, which we analyzed alongside relevant demographic and geographic variables that we expected to correlate with migration-likelihood estimates. Results reveal that more than half of the sample say that climate change is likely to influence their decision to move, a sentiment that is more common among Democrats than Republicans, consistent with previous survey research on partisan differences in climate-related risk perceptions.\n","Abstract Body: Science and storytelling mean different things when they speak of truth. This difference leads many to blame storytelling for presenting a distorted view of science and contributing to misinformation. Yet others celebrate storytelling as a way to engage audiences and share accurate scientific information. This review disentangles the complexities of how storytelling intersects with scientific misinformation. Even with their different conceptions of truth, the underlying purpose of both science and storytelling seek to make sense of the world and find our place within it. While storytelling can indeed lead to scientific misinformation, storytelling can also help science counter misinformation by providing meaning to reality that incorporates accurate science knowledge into human experience.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates evidencing practices in the media coverage of genomic research in German newspapers. <i>Evidencing practices<\/i> are textual strategies to support a scientific finding as <i>true<\/i>. In a content analysis, we explored three evidencing practices: (1) presenting data and methods, (2) citing experts and authorities and (3) stories about researchers, affected people or the study itself. We found experts and authorities to be the most prevalent evidencing practice, followed by narratives and finally data and methods. References to authorities – in general as well as a solo evidencing practice – are mostly used to substantiate findings of green genetic engineering that are risky, uncertain as well as controversial. Both data and methods and narratives, however, are rarely used as solo strategies, but are most often found in combination with other evidencing practices. These combinations help to communicate new and beneficial scientific findings from fields of basic research and red genetic engineering.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Instagram is often blamed for disrupting the tourism industry and causing visitation booms to destinations that were once considered “off the beaten path.” But to what extent does Instagram influence travel decisions? This study examines the relationship between Instagram posts and Millennial and Generation X users’ intent to travel to Yellowstone National Park, and tests a model based on the theory of planned behavior with the addition of anticipated social return (positive feedback through social media). Participants (N = 357) were randomly assigned to view an Instagram post with a photo (photo: landscape or wildlife) and a narrative (historical, tourist, or wildlife) in this between-subjects experiment.  Results indicate that photo condition and attitude toward traveling was mediated by political ideology, and attitude was negatively correlated with intent to travel, while greater social return, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were all positive predictors of intent to travel.\n","Abstract Body: International wildlife crime is a growing concern, contributing to the critical ongoing extinction<br />of biodiversity. While conservation organizations have been working to combat the wicked<br />problem of wildlife crime for years, communication research on this issue is limited. Little is<br />currently known about how conservation organizations communicate about wildlife crime. This<br />exploratory content analysis is a first step in developing a conceptual framework to analyze<br />manifest content in image-based wildlife crime prevention advertisements. Drawing from extant<br />interdisciplinary research in visual environmental communication, natural resource management<br />and marketing, we examine species characteristics, human roles, calls to action, and other<br />attributes in image-based wildlife crime prevention advertisements. Findings indicate that a<br />handful of conservation organizations are responsible for the majority of wildlife crime<br />prevention advertisements; flagship species predominate; humans are portrayed in multiple roles<br />such as guardians and criminals; advertisements mostly featured adult and live animals; and<br />information-seeking is the most common type of call to action for engaging viewers further.<br />Challenges and limitations of interdisciplinary conservation communication research are<br />discussed. We also note how this study can inform conservation communication campaigns and<br />benefit conservation practitioners, underscoring the importance of developing collaborative<br />relationships between scholars and practitioners.\n","Abstract Body: Successfully inciting people to share, like and comment on videos is key to producing successful advocacy campaigns because people are more likely to view, trust and share content engaged by their peers. This experimental study investigates the factors influencing young peoples’ willingness to engage online environmental advocacy videos. This study investigates the role that credibility; self-efficacy; issue salience; negative affect; emotion activation; perceived benefits to the self, others, or the environment; and social norms play in reported intention to share, like or comment (i.e., engage) on a video on social media. The final model explained 58.2% of the variance in viewers’ willingness to engage. Findings suggest advocates, agencies, and organizations seeking online environmental video engagement should target women, design video content to activate emotions (including alarm, interest, disgust, and moved), and design videos to convince viewers that engaging their content will benefit them, others, and the environment.\n","Abstract Body: Wildfire activity in the western U.S. has significantly increased in recent years and is expected to continue to increase into the future due to climate change. Photographs shared on social media are central to communicating wildfire risk with broad audiences. To understand the intersections of efficacy between visual communication of wildfire risk and climate change, we use Q-methodology interviews to investigate the extent to which photographs shared on Twitter during California’s Camp Fire create a concern for climate change. Findings from 38 Q sorts and interviews revealed people broadly agreed on which images were least concerning, such as scenes of aid and support and images of officials’ rescue meetings. Regarding which images were most effective, there were three different perspectives: catastrophic, urgent depictions (i.e., fire burning scenes); depictions of environmental impacts (i.e., smoky landscapes); and depictions of social impacts (i.e., individual human or animal suffering). Our findings contribute to the current literature on effective climate change visual communication by incorporating a perspective of disaster-related visual framing effect, while also offering practical advice for climate change advocates regarding how to use photographs of wildfire disasters to influence society’s concern for climate change.\n","Abstract Body: Using two samples of U.S. adults (Study 1: <i>N<\/i> = 368; Study 2: <i>N<\/i> = 440), this study features a messaging experiment utilizing a between-subjects design, with a no-message control group, to explore the effects of video-based narrative persuasion, in comparison to persuasive messages delivered in text-based or video-based infographic formats, on support for aquaculture. Results indicate that although the narrative video did not outperform the other two conditions in directly increasing support, transportation influenced support for aquaculture indirectly through risk and benefit perception, as well as through emotional responses to the information. For an emerging issue like aquaculture with environmental and human health implications, strategic messaging, especially when accompanied by vivid images, may allow audiences to better engage with a complex, and even contentious topic.<br />\n","Abstracts: Drawing on comparison of the circulation of racist hate in the contexts of India, Singapore, and New Zealand, I will explore the role of power in digital networks. The hatred toward indigenous communities, minorities and precarious migrants is constituted amid capitalist logics of neoliberal extraction. Putting forth the argument that the capitalist economics of hate is deeply intertwined with the political power of neoliberal capital, I will offer an analysis of the communicative inequalities that form the infrastructures of hate. In this backdrop, drawing on my work with developing anti-racist interventions, I will foreground the role of voices from the margins as anchors to challenging and dismantling hate.\n","Abstracts: This study analyzes US national and regional newspaper coverage of the August 2019 shooting incident at El Paso, Texas, perpetrated by a white terrorist who saw his mass shooting as “a response to the Hispanic invasion of Texas.” There are clear parallels between white terrorists’ justification for their attacks, and the racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric of mainstream politicians such as Donald Trump who have repeatedly referred to immigrants and refugees presence in the US as an “invasion.” Yet, media coverage frequently find ways to avoid drawing these parallels in their coverage of such outrageous and tragic events. However, media assiduously cover racist and hateful rhetoric by influential politicians in the name of keeping the public informed. What then are the  strategies of media coverage of hate crimes that are incited by racist and hateful political rhetoric? What ideologies inform these strategies? The analysis points to the need to examine the logic of media’s unwillingness to challenge the hateful rhetoric and hate crimes in relation to race and ethnicity in their coverage of such incidents.<br />\n","Abstracts: Communication research privileges the written word over the sensory experience of sound and sight. Thus, by acknowledging the often-invisible power of sounds and images to engage their bodies and minds in ways that words cannot, the co-authors interrogate their performative inventions of queerness in temporal and spatial paradoxes that remain uncaptured by the written word. They methodologically approach to such temporal and spatial paradoxes as <i>(im)possibilities of queerness<\/i> through which the White, Western, and Cisheteronormative ways of knowing about communication can be decolonized. They therefore argue that focusing on aural-based forms of embodied knowledge(s) adds to the discipline of communication by highlighting the distinct ways that sound can help decolonize their negotiations of queerness in/across the power lines of differences such as race, ethnicity, gender, class, nation, and the body. In so doing, they offer an intellectual space to reconsider open communication not just as a critical and reflexive practice, as a critical and reflexive practice, but also to ensure inclusivity, transparency, and dialogue.\n","Abstract Body: In order to increase awareness and understanding in cancer clinical trials (fewer than 5% of patients in the United Stated currently participate in a cancer clinical trial), this study aims to explore if the race and gender of a doctor can influence audiences’ responses to messages about clinical trials. Participants were exposed to two educational videos about clinical trials presented by a black or white, male or female doctor. Doctors in the videos use an emotional or technical frame to talk about clinical trials, as frames can influence message response. Participants completed a self-reported questionnaire after each video, while their real-time responses to the videos was measured via eye-tracking and facial expression. Results reveal that a doctor’s gender and, to a lesser extent, race could influence participants’ perceptions of the doctor and of clinical trials. Effects of frames were not as pronounced. Overall, participants’ real-time responses support their self-reported responses.\n","Abstract Body: The current study investigated the relationship between media use and self-esteem, with skin tone self-discrepancy as a mediator and gender as a moderator. Eighty undergraduate students from a U.S. university completed measures of media use, skin- tone self-discrepancy, gender, and self-esteem. Three main hypotheses were tested: 1) media use would be negatively correlated with self-esteem; 2) skin tone self-discrepancy would mediate the relationship between media use and self-esteem, and 3) skin tone self-discrepancy from media usage would be larger for women than men. Findings suggest greater skin tone self-discrepancy as a predictor of lower self-esteem. However, this was the only statistically significant result regarding the proposed hypotheses. Upon further examination, gender moderated the relationship between self-discrepancy and self-esteem, such that men were more likely to have lower self-esteem from skin tone self-discrepancy. Future research should examine this relationship closely and may consider race as a variable.\n","Abstract Body: Through decolonial and intersectional feminist frameworks, this work explores how iconography in United States cinema schools’ built environments may sustain the colonial matrix of power. Inspired by student protests of the John Wayne exhibit at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts (SCA), the present study interrogates how the film posters and exhibits in SCA uphold imperialist ideologies. Through textual analyses, I reveal that this iconography reproduces colonial categories of race, gender, and heterosexualism, and canonizes white, Western, heteromasculine subjects. Women of color are rendered nearly invisible—appearing in 2.5% of posters—and subjected to colonial representations. Men of color are marginally more visible and similarly represented through imperialist imagery. White women appear in over half of posters and are primarily depicted as objects of white, heteromasculine desire. Subsequently, through in-depth interviews with the student protestors, I explore the decolonial, anti-racist, and feminist possibilities within cinema education spaces.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Alt-right discourse, oriented around concepts such as ‘white genocide’ and disseminated via a calculatedly transgressive memetic communication style, is increasingly influential in Australia. This paper considers the impact of such discourse via an analysis of far-right forums xyz.net.au and #DingoTwitter. Using a combination of thematic analysis and critical discourse analysis, it analsyes materials drawn from both sites over a six-month period. From this analysis the paper argues that the emergence of the alt-right in Australia evidences a more general ‘platformisation of extremism’ and new ‘intersectional’ developments in extremist discourse that blur together race, religion, gender and science issues. To describe this new extremist imaginary the paper deploys the term ‘anti publics’ (Wark 1997; Cammaerts 2007) to account for the ways in which the very bases of the liberal democratic public sphere, long open to critique, are now under sustained and strategic attack from the far right.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores issues of identity and intergroup boundaries in an Aotearoa/New Zealand context by analysing Pacific audiences’ talk about their media practices. It reveals Pacific peoples, particularly youth, connect with indigenous Māori through a hybrid identity of ‘Brownness’ – and in ways that problematise both the role of identity in determining media practices and our assumptions about ethnic categories and audiences. This study’s findings about Pacific audiences’ use of Māori media raise questions about the way we imagine and categorize media and media practices as scholars, and suggests a need to re-examine the architectures of ethnic categorization (which can silo research) to not only better account for people’s multidimensional collective identities but also foster more open and inclusive research agendas.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined how Nigerian immigrants and sojourners in the U.S. negotiated their identity in light of stereotypes ascribed to them by their interaction partners. Qualitative research was used to understand how Nigerian immigrants and sojourners perceived being stereotyped, how they believed these stereotypes were perpetuated, and the strategies they employed in combating these stereotypes. Twenty Nigerian immigrants and sojourners from across the U.S. participated in an in-depth interview. Focused coding produced three distinctive categories. First, stereotypes were either communicated verbally or nonverbally. Second, past experiences with other Nigerians and media portrayals influenced how interaction partners stereotyped Nigerian immigrants and sojourners. Third, the strategies through which Nigerian immigrants and sojourners sought to curb these stereotypes included self-awareness, nationalism, and hard work. The paper discusses these results and their theoretical implications.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: Stereotypes; Ascribed Identity; Identity Negotiation\n",null,null,null,"Abstract Body: This study explores how publics who are racialized and otherized by other state's border securitization policies reconstruct their own identities and claims to sovereignty. By conducting a textual analysis of the mediated discourse generated in social media and Mexican newspapers about Donald Trump’s call for a border wall in the southern border of the U.S., we examine the resistance of the Mexican state, Mexican citizens and other transnational actors to American imperialist advances. As the case of Israel’s border wall became entangled in this discussion, mediated discourse in print and online engaged in a revaluation of alliances and solidarities between Mexico, the Jewish-Mexican community, Israel and Palestine. This analysis of contraflow and oppositional media output allows us to delve into rarely explored complexities of transnational and inter-state solidarities produced by non-Western agents. Therefore, this paper contributes to critical scholarship that investigates the nuances of transnational identity-formation and activism.<br />\n","Abstract Body: In this study, I provide a way of understanding the role Black podcasting plays in digital counterpublics. Drawing together frameworks like Jacobs and Townsley’s (2011) space of opinion and Harris-Perry’s (2004) theory of everyday Black political talk, I offer a new analytical model to understand how Black podcasting as a space of opinion features mediated everyday talk. The case I analyze centers around the Jay-Z and the NFL which sparked widespread discussion on ideas of Black capitalism and other political thoughts, on Black social networks and other digital counterpublics. I argue these discussions are accessed through a mediated everyday talk, demonstrating how new media technologies help to shape political thought and discourse. I conclude that viewing the concept of everyday talk through the lens of media captures the way Black media technologies contribute to the ways in which African Americans foster and develop ideas of Blackness, solidarity, and collectivity.\n","Abstract Body: This project examines how Nicaraguan print media discursively construct indigeneity in the midst of land encroachment and new Indigenous movements for self-determination in order to explore the nuanced modes through which neoliberal multiculturalist governance operates. Based on a multi-modal critical discourse analysis of 121 news articles reporting on the four main ethnic Indigenous groups of RAAN (the Northernmost Atlantic Autonomous Region of Nicaragua), this study found that discourse continuously highlighted communities’ cultural rights without mention of their material conditions, constructed Indigenous ‘helplessness’ in the face of land encroachers, and radicalized communities’ practice of self-determination through armed policing. These findings open up discussion around the ways in which media subtly reproduce the ideology of new neoliberal multiculturalist governments in Latin America, as this has not been previously addressed.\n","Abstract Body: This paper adopts a hospitality framework to analyze discourses of integration in the city of Antwerp. Anti-immigration and cultural racism have found a shared home in populist and nationalist movements in Europe, like the Flemish city that has become one significant site of tension between ideologically opposed groups on the subject of immigration. As such, hospitality coacts with discourses of race to mandate the adoption of dominant cultural norms by (im)migrant groups. In this paper, I unpack four discourses: (1) Not Belgium Anymore, (2) Belgian Complicity, (3) Intolerance of Intolerance, and (4) Interpersonal Knowledge, which emerged out of a critical ethnography comprised of participant observation and semi-structured interviews. This study on integration discourse complements extant research that has illuminated demonizing representations of immigrants as lazy, invading criminals, which is consequential as constructions of integration normalize and/or problematize restrictionist immigration policy. While each of these four discourses is complex, contested, and nuanced, they collectively presuppose a standard of assimilation for (im)migrants, whilst seeking to mitigate accusations of racism.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores the societal impact of cultural appropriation online as a form of self-categorization, specifically focusing on the role of whiteness in co-opting cultural norms from marginalized groups in the United States. Theoretically structured around social identity theory, intersectionality and technologies (Crenshaw, 1989) (Noble & Tynes, 2016), self-categorization (Korn, 2014) and self-presentation (Goffman, 1959), it becomes possible to better assess the ways in which establishing sociocultural identities within an electronic environment in the appropriative sense, whether conscious or not, works to undermine systems of oppression that in many cases have created the very appropriated forms of culture those in the majority now co-opt. The analysis is structured around three case studies highlighting the role of whiteness, as it pertains to social identity and personal branding, displayed in online spaces through the co-option of cultural norms from marginalized groups. These case studies emphasize the neoliberal capitalist nature of self-categorization, when ignored histories, dismissed power structures, and the appropriation of marginalized communities by dominant cultures exist.\n","Abstract Body: This paper consists of a textual analysis of Season 1 of <i>Grownish<\/i>, a popular television comedy that airs on the US cable TV network 'Freeform'. The television series follows Zoey Johnson, a young African-American female, and her experiences in a college away from home. I claim that <i>Grownish<\/i> foregrounds a non-white narrative through the ordinary everyday experiences of a clique of college students. In so doing, the text represents a counterforce to dominant hegemonic representations of African-Americans. <i>Grownish<\/i> is compared to the more explicitly resistant television series <i>Dear White People<\/i> and its representation of young African Americans.\n","Abstract Body: In contradistinction to print distribution of the traditional black press, digital media increases the accessibility of black press outlets. New media has created additional ways to reach African-American consumers but it also allows those outside of the black community to more easily view black press content. This research finds that the nonblack audience for black press outlets is nearly three times larger than the black audience online. As more black press websites produce entertainment content and the number of nonblack-owned black press outlets increases, a majority-white audience composition requires further investigation. This paper analyzes how the white gaze on black press entertainment content can result in unbalanced perspectives for nonblack readers and explores how the prevalence of entertainment on nonblack-owned sites calls monetary priorities into question. I conclude that black press outlets’ shifts in audience and content may ultimately affect the intentions and perceptions of an important African-American institution.\n","Abstract Body: This article analyzes the representations of non-white identities in an HBO’s fantasy show “Game of Thrones” (GOT). By specifically focusing on hegemonic relations between white characters and characters of color, the research scrutinizes the rhetorical strategies through which non-whiteness is enacted in relation to white “natives” of the “Westeros.” Authors show that the GOT employs orientalist discourse in constructing the world of Westeros and contrasts it with the exotic lands of Essos. Westeros is rich, white and located in the western hemisphere, while Essos is a scorched and mysterious land located in the East. By associating the show’s major characters with Westeros and the casting of white actors, viewers are encouraged to identify with their complex struggles and to embrace their intricate characterizations. On the other hand, Essos’ characters of color typically include marginalized characters such as slaves, servants, and pirates. Their story arcs are glazed over and their characterization serves not to enhance the narrative but to emphasize the uniqueness of a superior cultural entity, i.e. Westeros. In the process, identities of color are objectified and used as a referential point which underlines the hegemonic dominance of the West and situates the dominant white characters as hegemons. In other words, ‘othered’ identities of color perpetuate colonial ideas and disseminate the Orientalist view of East/West dichotomy in popular culture. A central argument of this essay is that an understanding of the politics through which non-white groups are culturally marginalized simultaneously requires an examination of the politics through which whites are centered and legitimized in cultural practices. The essay discusses the implications in which GOT perpetuates long-established relations in a re-imagined system of power, which its writers and audiences have identified as female progressive and noted for its narrative complexity.<br /><br />Keywords: whiteness, popular culture, game of thrones, Orientalism, hegemony<br /><br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Giddajohtin was a nine-day live, minute-by-minute production broadcast by NRK, the Norwegian Public Service Broadcaster between 24 April and 3 May 2017. We explore how the Indigenous Sámi community participated in and influenced key decision-making processes in this production. Our study is based on a purposive sample of qualitative interviews with individuals involved in the commissioning, development and production of the programme. We also reviewed the live broadcast, the archived programme and related documentation. The Sámi community had a decisive influence on this production, drawing in particular on knowledge and competence relating to reindeer herding and land use, and contributing to an innovative approach to storytelling. Our analysis shows that in order to equalize power relations, we need to move beyond essentialist understandings of Indigenous communities, and to explore how different actors, and actor positions, can be included and empowered at all levels of decision-making in media production.\n","Abstract Body: We report in this essay some of the findings of the Waitangi Tribunal on New Zealand’s racist public health care system and the concomitant health inequalities exacted upon Māori, the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand. A culture-centered intervention anchored in theorizing Māori health and wellbeing and culturally-grounded in the diverse realities of iwi, [tribes] centers Māori as the health communicative experts of their own realities. Our co-constructive dialogues sought to build infrastructures of listening and communication among iwi members of Ngāti Kauwhata, located in the Manawatu, Aotearoa New Zealand. These types of dialogue emerge from ongoing conversations with Kaupapa Māori, a Māori research methodology “for Māori, by Māori,” foregrounding the role of voice democracy in creating anchors to health and wellbeing among Māori. The articulations of Māori health are offered as interventions into the large-scale health inequalities experienced by Māori in Aotearoa, New Zealand.<br /><br />Keywords: Māori health, land, culture-centered approach\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines how news media contributes to a racialized discourse of failure and deficit in Indigenous education. A time sensitive critical news text analysis of reporting about Indigenous education in Australia from 2008-2018 revealed that three news stories dominated coverage of Indigenous education: school attendance and the ‘truancy crisis’, educational performance as measured through national testing, and the benefits of boarding school education. The paper considers how the three topics of attendance, performance and boarding emerged and were told as independent stories that rose and fell in prominence over time, and how the interweaving of the three topics worked together to perpetuate and privilege colonial and neoliberal discourses. We conclude that news media coverage was integral to constructing Indigenous education as problematic and that intense media coverage of selected ‘solutions’ to fix Indigenous education further entrenched a discourse of deficit around Indigenous identity.\n","Abstract Body: While existing scholarship provides detailed analyses of media representations of Gypsy, Traveller and Roma (GTR) people in the United Kingdom zooming in on prominent debates, we lack an overview of the evolution of media representations of Roma people over time. 33,564 news articles focusing on Roma people were collected from high-circulation quality and tabloid British newspapers for over thirty years (1985-2018). The data was analyzed with an innovative topic modeling technique – Latent Dirichlet Allocation that resulted in a relational overview of the topics covered in the newspapers. Systematic (e.g. education) and event-focused topics (e.g. crime) were identified, but the results diverge from existing research in two ways: (1) event-focused topics are not isolated instances of reporting but recurring events to be analyzed in connection to each other; (2) media discourse concerning Roma people shifted from Roma as a national concern to Roma as an international issue concerning a homogenized group.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The goals of this project are embodied in three pertinent questions: How does indentured labor (among marginal hill communities) known as <i>Coolies<\/i> during colonial times, and labor (migrant and Muslim) in an age of Free Trade and Neoliberalism, differ qualitatively? How has the practice changed and endured over the years despite active civil society institutions’ advocacy for human rights and equitable labor laws in the country? Does unorganized labor in free trade economies become invisible? The study will be informed by excavating extant archives, media artifacts, and by conducting ethnographic interviews to understand current labor relations between the <i>employers<\/i> of commercial businesses and services and the <i>employed<\/i> (load bearers). Since the study works with different methodological traditions, it allows the researcher triangulated insight. The interplay of different sets of texts will help us understand the ways in which media representation and archival records on one hand, and the oral narratives of load bearers on the other, socially construct the <i>coolie<\/i> as an acceptable, yet anachronistic, figure in modern day India and South Asia.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This article examines social media use among Roma in the Czech Republic, paying close attention to use of platforms like Facebook among activist groups. Through ethnographic research that is part of a larger project, this article examines the potential of online spaces in transforming into places of collaboration, activism, and how social media may embody both emotional and “material” places manifesting as additional/alternative homes. Online spaces are not the only sites in which people may experience belonging, but as Czech society continues to exclude Roma, this article examines how Roma may locate online places to work through feelings of spatial alienation. At the same time, this article explores tensions and contradictions of these digital spaces that may involve issues like the lack of resources and the fragmentation of community – and of communal space – by such variables as age, language and technological access and literacy. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper describes the ways that digital activism is shaping ethnocultural identity movements using the case of Latin American feminist groups situated in the United Kingdom. Building broad coalitions outside of panethnic boundaries of Latinidad has been a crucial tactic for activists who are critically interrogating colonialism, especially as its ramifications are being reified in post-Brexit Britain. The use of hashtags such as #MeToo, #BlackLivesMatter, and #Cuéntalo (which means “tell it” in Spanish) is both a rhetorical strategy and an important aspect of coalition-building for Latin American feminists seeking more inclusive activism that includes indigenous, black, and LGBT+ women. This paper describes the ways that activists have used hashtags as a means to describe structural and domestic violence, claim a space within the broader movements, align with particular politics, and successfully mobilized more inclusive coalitions than previous Latin American activism in Britain. I discuss the ways that recent activism is informed by intersectional feminism and concerned with decoloniality that both interrogates Latinidad as a problematic postcolonial panethnic identity, but embraces and celebrates aspects of Latin American culture as a means to connect, discuss, and mobilize. In addition, I argue how a stronger alignment with #BlackLivesMatter rather than #Cuéntalo represents an important aspect of recent changes to contemporary Latin American Feminist activism in the U.K.<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: This research aims to address the gap in research surrounding the social media phenomena of “blackfishing.” Exploring the use of signifiers of an Afrocentric identity such as language use and physical representation by non-Black individuals leads to a better understanding of how these signifiers can be abused for fame. Focusing on two women who were outed via Twitter as altering their physical presentations in order to appear Mixed, forms a case study examining racism, reality, and social media influencers. By confirming Emma Hallberg’s (@eemmahallberg) and Mika Bryony’s (@mikabryony) purposeful alteration of their skin color, hair, and facial features, we can then explore their efforts to recant and reestablish their own racial identity, or lack thereof. Approaching this researching through Baudrillard’s concept of simulacra and simulation creates a case study of reality and the hyper-real on social media.<br /><br />Keywords: blackfishing; Instagram; semiotics.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores how international volunteers from the so-called ‘developed countries’ use social media to craft their self-representations of the work of 'voluntourism'. It seeks to go beyond extant works that can tend towards easy generalisations that overly celebrate or overly critique not only the work of voluntourism, but voluntourists themselves. To do this, we draw on life story interviews with ten international volunteers—from France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and Belgium—each of whom completed their voluntary work at the Slukat Learning Center in Bali, Indonesia. We underscore how the ways that voluntourists view their diverse experiences clearly shape the ways that they harness the polymedia environment offered to them by contemporary digital media. Crucially, we show that this becomes especially clear in the process in which voluntourists deliberate the challenges and implications of their online self-representations, especially those that involve the local communities with whom they have worked.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores the history, scope, and collective mobilization efforts of the South Asian Journalists Association (SAJA), a unique ethnoracial professional organization located in the multiracial context of the United States. We contend here that the SAJA’s dual organizational roles in juggling ethnoracial and professional identity formations are woven into the larger story of the Indian diaspora’s recent growth in the workforce of U.S. news and public affairs media. Our analysis draws on and examines the organization’s website, e-mail communication, social media content, and news reports. The paper first explores the embeddedness of the SAJA within the larger ecosystems of Indian American associations and migration patterns to argue that this organization forges valued “occupational citizenship” for its members. We then study the founding of the SAJA, its evolution, and its communicative practices to consider the implications for nuancing the model minority myth and producing a progressive ethnoracial ethos.\n","Abstract Body: Using a public set of academic sexual misconduct cases occurring between 1975 and 2018, we conducted a systematic textual analysis of news media coverage and court documents about academic sexual misconduct in the United States. This study is a work in progress: We have coded 247 cases to discern patterns related to gender, disciplines, results of investigations, and referencing and context of #metoo. We found that in 27 cases #metoo was mentioned in at least one news article about a case; 21 of these occurred in 2017 and 2018. Informed by feminist scholarship, our results show the kind and extent of the impact of the me too movement, particularly on victims/survivors (hereafter called ‘victims’) of academic sexual misconduct. The me too movement inspired victims to come forward to seek justice, and compelled institutions to review policies and procedures relating to academic sexual misconduct.\n","Abstract Body: Women endure the most severe and sustained forms of harassment on the Internet (Lenhart et al., 2016; Duggan et al., 2015). Whether it is cyberstalking by a former intimate partner or anonymous rape and death threats, online harassment jeopardizes women’s safety, privacy and freedom of expression (Chemaly, 2019). This paper examines how feminist activists challenge online harassment at the legislative and policy making level. At a time when social networks are seeking solutions to online abuse, this ongoing research is exploring how feminist messages get through to key decision makers. The subject of this study is the movement to end non-consensual pornography in the United States. Defined as the non-consensual disclosure of intimate sexual content (Citron & Franks 2014), non-consensual pornography is a common online abuse that disproportionately impacts marginalized women (Bates, 2017; Eaton et al., 2017). Over the last ten years, small networks of non-profit organizations have mobilized against non-consensual pornography, and their strategic interventions are having a significant impact on legislators and technology companies. The first part of this paper explores how feminist ideas and approaches shape activists’ advocacy strategies. The second part of this paper charts the course of their interventions with state and federal legislators, social networks, and ‘Big Tech’ lobbying groups.\n","Abstract Body: Drawing on literature from legal studies, feminist scholarship, and research on communication and technology, this paper examines how social media content is used against female victims in sexual assault trials to advance rape myth narratives. Specifically, we focus on how social media evidence from Facebook, in the form of pre-and post-assault conversations between the complainant and the defendant, as well as the complainant’s own personal social media content, are used to discredit assault claims and make moralizing arguments about victim behavior. We also consider how judges evaluate social media evidence in the larger context of the case. Preliminary findings from a content analysis of sexual assault judgments (N=287) show that social media evidence is unfairly weaponized against complainants in ways that perpetuate stereotypes about pre- and post-assault victim behavior and risk furthering rape myths. We also find that while the presence of social media evidence leads women who come forward to experience further vulnerability at trial, there is a growing realization among judges that legal defense arguments built around rape myth narratives are problematic, and that a complainant’s behavior and social media communications should not be a reason to discredit her credibility.<br /><i>Keywords: Rape myth, social media, sexual violence, digital evidence, content analysis<\/i><br />\n","Abstract Body: Sugar dating can be understood in a variety of contexts, ranging from the salacious interactions of fictional characters to the questions sugar daters pose in digital forums. The prototypical sugar relationship consists of two partners: a person of pronounced financial means, and a person who, in exchange for providing some degree of companionship, receives payments and/or lavish gifts. This companionship practice carries an inherent peculiarity, as sugar dating relationships are overtly transactional. In spite of the moral ambiguity these pairs inspire, companies have reconciled - and commodified - their peculiarity by creating websites that facilitate the formation of sugar relationships. In this work in progress, I begin to develop a framework for exploring communicated roles via a textual analysis of five sugar dating websites. This analysis marks the start of a multistudy exploration of sugar daters and the entities responsible for mediated depictions of sugar dating. I argue that the latter serve as key starting points for this project because they define the (gendered) parameters of the prototypical sugar relationship and mainstream a practice that is - in many respects - of questionable legality. Understanding how sugar dating websites manufacture and market relationship roles prepares us for research on how sugar daters embody or resist these characterizations.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Like LGBTQ people and people of color, sex workers engage in caring practices to support one another in the absence of state and often familial care, and although these practices are not discrete from each other, they can be broadly divided into physical and emotional care. Physical care may take the form of care in the case of illness or injury, assisting others with the physical demands of the job, or tending to their dependents. Emotional care may include helping others cope with the emotional and psychological demands of the job as well as their personal problems. Through interviews conducted with twenty current or former sex workers in 2018 and drawing on queer and feminist theories of labor and family, this paper charts both the physical and emotional caring practices among sex workers and suggests how caring labor may be distributed more equally and performed beyond the confines of the hetero-nuclear family. While emotional care was more common than physical care overall, physical care can be crucial under exceptional circumstances compounded by structural vulnerabilities. Moreover, these networks of care can scale up and expand outward, providing a model for broader social change.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper is part of a longitunadal multi-method study examining the promotion, education, and management of Title IX related information on a large Southeastern university. This work in progress looks at data from focus groups of undergraduate students to understand the impact of an 18 month campaign on their knowledge and efficacy to navigate Title IX violations and their expereinces on campus. Early findings are that the campaign has not gone far enough to equip students effectively or to promote a humane and equitable college experience for women and trans*, genderqueer, and non-binary students.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This paper explores the ongoing projects of researchers into both the power and dangers of digital public protest movements. This work currently focuses on hashtag protests that have used social media to highlight issues of caste, class, gender and race. The protest movements used in this paper are global in scale, originating in both the continent of India and with the global digital diaspora of India. Hashtag protests studied include LeanInIndia and various movements within the fiber craft and DIY social media world, such as the hashtag of #diverseknitty, amongst others. In looking at these hashtags, this paper demonstrate how open communication is not always open for everyone. While the open field of social media allows for more voices to be heard the research presented here shows how that supposedly ‘open’ field continues to privilege specific voices and downplay or ignore subaltern voices, such as the privileging of upper caste Indian women over the concerns of Dalit women. The research within this paper contains both the good and bad that continuously coexists within open hashtag public protests movements. While these movements allow for the interaction and visibility of many protests, they continue to sideline or dismiss many voices who are considered Other. Thus, while social media movement are useful in research it becomes important for scholars and activists to ask questions of whose voices are being heard in these spaces and how we can listen to and amplify the ones who are not.\n",null,null,null,"Abstract Body: Egg freezing is the most recent of the series of assisted reproductive technologies that are coming into fore during the past few decades. In this article, I will focus on the ways dedicated egg freezing clinics are using social media platforms to advertise their services. I trace key characteristics of such advertisements that deviate from typical health care promotions, by showing that egg freezing is being offered as a universal, affordable and commodified service. Through getting access to intimate details of women’s lives through social media platforms, these curiously personalized advertisements are targeting women’s vulnerabilities and subconscious insecurities regarding reproduction by featuring ageing as a disabling process. I argue that by leaving men out of the picture, egg freezing service providers (who rarely identify as clinics) are simultaneously making women aware of and responsible for their future capacity (or incapacity) to become biological mothers, and reproducing the normative ideal of a fertile female body that thrives in a heterosexual family bonded by genetics.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The quest for a Viagra-equivalent for women has managed both to reignite concerns over female oppression <i>and<\/i> rekindle hope for gender equality. Communication about waned desire in women came under intense scrutiny, especially the ways in which it might legitimize one view or the other. This article presents results of a systematic review of studies on the frames used in public communication about drugs/devices designed to increase female libido. We synthesize findings, assess the strength of evidence, thus substantiating discussions on a hot-button issue.\n","Abstract Body: Politics in the US has historically been a male and white dominated field. However, the Democratic contenders for the 2020 presidential bid has been deemed the most diverse group of Americans ever to run for president. Informed by a feminist and critical theoretical framework that acknowledges intersectionality, this study—currently a work in progress—examines how US news outlets addressed diversity and constructed these candidates. Preliminary findings show that only very few articles directly addressed the diversity of the candidates and that most of the focus was on matters of race, which was often an issue the debates themselves. These results inform a reflection about contemporary journalism and its portrayal of intersectional identities in politics.\n","Abstract Body: Recommendations on online professional networks like LinkedIn are meant to open opportunities for job candidates—but do they also have the power to perpetuate problematic gender stereotypes? Keeping in mind the importance of job references as well as disproportionate hurdles women often face in the tech industry, this study focuses on the convergence of these two topics. Specifically, through the feminist lenses of social role theory, role congruity theory, and the lack of fit model, this study analyzes whether gender stereotypes or counterstereotypes in online recommendations for software engineers have an impact on perceptions of employee quality. Results from an experiment (<i>N<\/i>=431) showed that stereotypically masculine or feminine descriptors in LinkedIn recommendations significantly increased the likelihood that participants would perceive the job candidates such a light—even though the candidates did not use these stereotypical self-descriptors. Additionally, more communal (i.e., stereotypically feminine) descriptors in recommendations significantly led to higher ratings of likability—a finding which may be more groundbreaking for men, but unsurprising for women, who are socialized from early childhood to be warm, caring, and nurturing. Participants who were men significantly rated all software engineers more negatively—which may call for more women on hiring panels, as first impressions of candidates appear to differ by gender. Lastly, no significant interaction occurred in which gender stereotypical or counter-stereotypical recommendations led to differing evaluations—perhaps a reason to hope that gender stereotypes may be losing salience in evaluations of candidates.<br /><br />Keywords: Gender stereotypes, bias, employee recommendations, women in tech, role congruity theory, LinkedIn, internet/online communication.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores gender, and more specifically, women’s roles within the Italian social movement/party, <i>CasaPound Italia<\/i> (CPI) a self-defined fascist organization founded in Rome in 2003. Specifically, in this paper I plan to address the interactions among the following dimensions: women’s experience in the movement, media representation of women, and gender-related policies. The main questions leading the research are: what is the role and the experience of women within this organization? What are CPI’s official positions with regard to gender, women’s roles in society and about feminism, in general? For this research, I implement a multi-layered approach consisting of ethnography (a limited number of interviews and observations of public events) and an analysis of the organization’s public documents, social media postings, and other self-produced publications that are related to gender and women in particular.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This work in progress analyzes how the U.S. news media frame the issue of domestic violence against female immigrant spouses of American citizens and permanent residents. A qualitative content analysis is used to review 59 printed news articles for the time period 2009-2019. The research lies at the intersection of feminist theory, immigrant studies, and domestic violence studies and is aimed at understanding and improving the conditions of battered immigrant women.\n","Abstract Body: In the year 2000, United Nations released a report stating that every year around 5000 women become victims of honor killing. Contrary to the popular convention, in India, in 2018, a Christian man from a marginalized caste was killed because he married an upper caste Hindu woman. I conducted a qualitative content analysis of negative comments on YouTube video in which the wife of the deceased gives an interview. Five categories of negative comments have emerged. They are altruistic patriarch, victim blaming, murderous rage, derogatory remarks and murder apologists. All these categories demonstrate the pervasiveness of 'Brahmanical Patriarchy', an ideology which ritually has oppressed women and lower castes. Based on these findings, the study illustrates that honor killing is not just a social crime in India but is an institutional crime, for which appropriate legal sanction should be provided  to curb it or else web2.0  will serve as online modern regressive tool where agency of a woman in controlled, subjugated and mocked at by propagating hate speech.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Using data from the 2010 and 2015 Chinese General Social Surveys, we examined the factors affecting men’s and women’s gender role attitudes. We found that individuals’ attitudes towards gender became more egalitarian from 2010 to 2015, but this was largely attributed to urban women, and not for men. Rural women still held the most traditional gender attitudes. As media becoming an important source for people to access to egalitarian ideas, the old factors that used to predict gender role attitudes, such as education, work experience, and family structure, became less significant. From 2010 to 2015, the Internet has replaced traditional media in promoting people’s egalitarian attitudes, especially for women. The implications of these findings are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: In this paper, we content analysed from the framing theory the way female refugees are visually depicted in 500 journalistic photographs published between 2013 and 2017 on ten of the news digital media with the greatest public impact from five of the Western European countries most affected by the wave of migration during the refugee crisis (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and United Kingdom). The most representative media of western culture and with an international projection were selected. We tested from the visual framing theory if women were underrepresented in these main European media, if they were associated to religious symbols more frequently than male refugees, and if they were depicted connotatively in a different way than male refugees. We found that, indeed, there was an underrepresentation of female refugees in the photographs of the analysed European media, and female refugees were more frequently associated with religious symbols than male. Moreover, female refugees were more frequently depicted as <i>victims<\/i> compared to male, while male refugees were more frequently depicted in <i>burden<\/i> or <i>threat<\/i> frames compared to female, so that in a more negative but also more active way. This means that, both through the under-representation and through the way in which they are represented in the European media photographs, female refugees are being associated with a passive and secondary role. European media are contributing to reinforce the so-called “symbolic annihilation” of women by condescendingly showing female refugee as a inoffensive, vulnerable, and submissive subject.\n","Abstract Body: From its inception in the early 1990s, Nollywood, the cinema of Nigeria, has complicated the representations of women in popular media, expanding, in the process, Nigeria’s discourse landscape for filmmakers, media practitioners, and the public to engage gender and feminism questions. This paper interrogates how contemporary indigenous African feminisms – particularly, Akachi Ezeigbo’s “snail-sense” feminism” – can be engaged in the reading of Nollywood melodrama. Using a critical discourse analysis of two films, <i>Glamour Girls<\/i> (1994) and <i>Fifty<\/i> (2015), the paper examines not only the performances of gender in Nollywood films, but also how these performances bear out the multiple and varied iterations of the indigenous feminisms by Nigerian feminist scholars who continue to question the dominant patriarchal normative order. It contends that rather than being an aberration, subversion of gender relationships by women has been Nollywood’s intended objective all along.\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines at how mobile telephony is influenced by and is shaping gender roles in Myanmar, where mobile phones have only recently become commonplace.  We draw data from nationally wide survey of over 8000 adults, qualitative interviews and ethnographic observations over a period of one and half years before and after the commercialization of mobile phones in Myanmar. Commercialization of mobile connections (SIM cards) in mid-2014 reduced costs while creating easy access to mobile phones, enabling large numbers of the public to buy and use them. Our findings showed equivalence in terms of mobile phone ownership amongst men and women but detected differences in usage patterns and the evolving forms of deployment.  We draw implications with respect to changing gender roles in the country and the potential impact on women’s status in Myanmar society.<br />Keywords: Smart phone use, Myanmar, Gender roles, ICTD<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores how gendered labour and the coordination of writers’ labour in the<br />Korean television industry are optimized to transform the production process of cultural<br />commodities, such as through shorter and faster cycles of production, and the popularity of<br />unscripted TV programs. In particular, this paper focuses on entertainment writers in the South<br />Korean television industry, who produce entertainment TV shows such as reality TV shows and<br />music shows. They usually work for broadcasting or entertainment companies without any<br />contract. To explore this topic, I conducted in-depth interviews with eighteen writers and five<br />PDs (producer & director). This research shows that writing scripts is only a part of these writers’<br />work. The writer group is supposed to engage in a variety of invisible physical and mental labour,<br />and their work is defined by what is necessary depending on the nature of the TV show.<br />Moreover, this paper discloses that most of the writers collaborate on making TV shows together<br />with a project team that has a flexible, hierarchical structure that is coordinated and controlled by<br />head writers. The work organization of these writers has some of the features of a patriarchal<br />family.\n","Abstract Body: Using Goffman’s (1956) conceptualization of self-presentation in the context of the online world as theoretical scaffolding, in this article I explore the political potential of women’s self-representation/identity dynamics through Instagram in post-Arab Spring countries by drawing on the accounts of 10 young women Instagrammers from Egypt and Tunisia. Political potential is understood as ““everyday politics” in which seemingly mundane issues, like Instagram self-representation, have the potential to…reclaim [women’s] agency…functioning as a form of “everyday activism”” (Caldeira, Bauwel, & De Ridder, 2018, p. 1). With this as basis, I analyze the images posted by the 10 Instagrammers, alongside the text and hashtags that accompanied them. The analysis brought forth three key themes; the Egyptian and Tunisian female Instagrammers’ online self-presentation: 1) manifesting civic-republican citizenship; 2) as rooted cosmopolitanism; and 3) exhibiting a naïve dialecticism between their collectivist and individualist self-concepts. This work is critical in assessing the role of Instagram in creating new platforms, identities, and political realities for young women in contemporary Egypt and Tunisia, two countries that have taken very different trajectories post-Arab Spring.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores the alternative media representations of post-Soviet rural women in Estonia. It asks what kind of (counter)hegemonic versions of post-socialist rurality and rural femininities emerge in connection with the portrayals of these women in a nation-wide rural grassroots movement, “Live on Earth.” It draws on variety of theories and concepts from post-colonial feminism, cultural studies, cultural geography, and utilizes textual analysis to answer these questions. The results demonstrate that the alternative representations of Estonian rural women are mainly challenging the dominant ideas of post-socialist rurality and rural femininities. These post-Soviet rural women have developed alternative, empowered identities that help them to renegotiate their place in society.\n","Abstract Body: #MeToo movement in China gained momentum in 2018 after a former PhD student from Beihang University posted a well written accusation of sexual harassment against her renowned supervisor on social media. Both the university and the government responded quickly and actively to her case. Encouraged by the success of the first allegation, more women and men broke their silences and shared their stories online. In this paper, I argued that the influential personal narratives created and posted by victims of sexual harassment or assaults is an emerging form of resistance in Chinese feminist movement. Through a preliminary framing analysis of 31 personal narratives related to 9 events collected from a comprehensive open-access #MeToo archive and relevant social media platforms, the paper examined how the participants of #MeToo contested the dominate discourse of female victims and reproduced the victim-subject through performative acts.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study proposed a two-dimensional model for perceived realism in video games consisting of game narrative and game HCI. Using this two-dimensional measure, the impacts of perceived realism of game narrative and game HCI on identification and immersion are explored and compared. Results indicate the two-dimensional model has a relatively good fit with the data, and perceived realism of game HCI has a stronger impact on identification and immersion compared to game narrative.\n","Abstract Body: RESEARCH PAPER - Gameplay livestreaming is a rapidly growing field for both streamers and researchers. One area presently underrepresented by researchers is the influence of livestreaming on the gameplay. Twitch built its synchronous chat system over Internet-Relay Chat (IRC) and allows users to tag other users, such as streamers, in their messages. This study logged thousands of chats over a month and then pulled chat messages which targeted partnered steamers in the partnered streamer’s chat. Machine learning identified common trigrams and then grounded theory methods produced general gameplay and gamespace engagement themes. The two primary engagement themes involved either streamers or viewers adopting gamespace roles traditionally limited to a non-player character (NPC). Viewers can change the roles of streamers through posing game-related questions and they can change their roles through providing tutorial-like recommendations. As viewers and streamers continue to alter what is included within gamespace, it requires additional insights into what that should mean for future game development and research.\n","Abstract Body: Who is a gamer? What kind of people are perceived to be gamers? And finally – who perceives themselves as a gamer? In this article the authors attempt to answer these three questions from a multinational perspective. To begin with, the stereotypical image of a gamer is analyzed. Secondly, according to the existing literature, the authors search for a definition of a gamer that is accepted in the scientific field. Finally analysis of quantitative research results aim to answer the third question—who perceives themselves as a gamer? The goal of this research is to compare the results of a study conducted in two different countries, the United States of America and Poland, in an open collaboration to better understand the characteristics of players that self-identified as gamers.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The demand framework is commonly used by game scholars to develop new and innovative ways to improve the gaming experience. However, the present paper aims to expand this framework and apply it to problematic gaming, also known as trolling. Although still a relatively new field, research into trolling has exploded within the past ten years. However, the vast majority of these studies are descriptive in nature. The present article marries theory and trolling research by closely examining interdisciplinary empirical evidence from a single platform – video games – and applying the various forms of demands to propose a testable, dual-route model of trolling behaviour. Within the video game context, I argue the presence of two primary causal mechanisms that can lead to trolling: 1) demand imbalance between players and the game, and 2) demand imbalance between players. The paper discusses how these two types of imbalance can lead to trolling, which kinds of demands can be imbalanced, and how future researchers can use the demand framework to expand our understanding of trolling.\n","Abstract Body: <br />This flashlight paper opens up communication between game studies and feminist studies through an analysis of Hasbro Games’ Ms. Monopoly. Three brief analytical lenses—(1) a cultural/historical analysis of the Monopoly franchise, (2) a visual/textual analysis of the messages and values that the Ms. Monopoly game seemingly emits, and (3) a media analysis of news outlets and social media users’ reaction and general sentiment toward the Ms. Monopoly game—all lead to the conclusion that the Ms. Monopoly board game fails to meet its aim to “celebrate women” in a meaningful way.\n","Abstract Body: Familiarity is a mistreated construct in game studies, measured heuristically, by proxy, or as a control. It must be examined with more precision, fidelity, and focus. To these ends, familiarity is best understood as a knowledge structure comprising information, affect, and expertise. Knowledge structures (schemata, mental models, etc.) exist in a continuum of abstractness that forms the infrastructure for familiarity with games. Drawing from known knowledge-structure theory and methods to examine familiarity will inform our understandings of gaming experiences and effects.\n","Abstract Body: RESEARCH PAPER Sexism towards women in eSports video game environments has become a pervasive issue. Through an online survey (<i>N<\/i> = 321), this study investigated the relationships between eSports game exposure, in-game positions, player’s social dominance orientation personality, and their hostile and benevolent sexism beliefs. The results showed that core-position players reported higher scores on both hostile and benevolent sexism than support players, and a higher social dominance orientation also predicted higher hostile sexism beliefs, while there is no significant relationship found between general game exposure and sexism beliefs. This study examined cultivation theory in the context of online competitive games and highlighted the social consequences of hierarchical settings such as positions and roles in eSports games.\n","Abstract Body: RESEARCH PAPER: The connection between player and avatar is central to digital gaming, with identification assumed to be core to this connection. Often, scholarship engages single dimensions of identification, yet emerging perspectives reveal that identification is polythetic (PID)—comprised fo at least six sufficient (but not necessary) mechanisms. The current study investigates the intersections of polythetic identification mechanisms and two different approaches to player-avatar sociality (as a marker of differentiation): general types of player-avatar relationships (PARs) and discrete dimensions of player-avatar interaction (PAX). Secondary analysis of an existing dataset of gamers (<i>N<\/i> = 838 retained for the current analysis) revealed that players reported overall diminished identification when they engaged in non-social relations with their avatar and increased identification when they perceived higher mental and physical similarities with their avatar. Increased liking and perspective-taking were most likely with human-like social relations, which require differentiation from rather than identification as the avatar. Results suggests that different paths to identification are important, depending on discrete qualities of the player-avatar relationship.\n","Abstract Body: Hegemonic language ideologies have long gone unquestioned in videogames. Language ideology refers to widespread beliefs about language and language users that are utilized to judge and discriminate against individuals based on their language use. Language ideologies are embedded with cultural, moral, and political values and extend to beliefs regarding individuals’ identities and worth based on their use of language; they are also deeply intertwined with issues of race (Woolard & Schieffelin, 1994). Hegemonic language ideologies may be communicated in videogames through the under-representation, misrepresentation, and othering of marginalized people by using their language to characterize them (Ensslin, 2010; Ensslin, 2011; Goorimoorthee, Csipo, Carlton, & Ensslin, 2019; Hammar, 2012). To further understand this phenomenon in videogames and bring attention to the ways that language ideology is perpetuated through games, this paper investigates the ways in which language ideology is reproduced through implicit and explicit language use in Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rockstar Games 2018). Though a plethora of languages and varieties of English are displayed throughout Red Dead Redemption 2, it often relies on standard language ideologies to evaluate language use and assign varieties to characterize non-player characters based on stereotypes and inaccurate understandings of language. By neglecting to challenge these oppressive ideologies, they are communicated as normative and therefore acceptable. Understanding the capacity of videogames to communicate ideologies, language must be recognized as a powerful communicator of stereotypes as well as a means for inclusion which must be viewed critically.\n","Abstract Body: The current study uses detailed and extensive smartphone trace data to explore the longitudinal effects of in-game purchase behavior on continual mobile game use. In total, we analyzed 26513 mobile games among 3476 mobile gamers. A Cox regression with time-dependent covariates was performed to analyze whether or not performing in-game purchases in a mobile game affects the risk of players removing the gaming app from their repertoire. Results show that making an in-game purchase in a mobile game decreases this risk initially, prolonging the survival time of the mobile gaming app during the first few weeks. However, this effect significantly changes over time. After the first few weeks of playing the game, a reversal effect is found where previous in-game purchase behavior negatively affects the further survival of the game instead. On the other hand, mobile games without previous monetary investment are more prone to long-term continual game use if they survive the first initial weeks. Methodological and theoretical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Communities and their members, online and off, face a variety of challenges. We studied the online component of three gaming communities for games in a series when a new game in that series was released to see if community members transitioned to the new community for the newly released game, meaning they would leave their old community for the then-old game. This could mean people would need to form new ties in the new community, and that the old community may collapse. Our main findings were that most people did not move to the new community for the new game, but stuck with their established community, and that nostalgia played an important part for some of these gamers, who we frame as fans. Data came from Reddit boards for <i>The Elder Scrolls<\/i>, <i>Fallout<\/i>, and the <i>Civilization<\/i> series, comprising metadata on over 10 million posts from five different year-long time periods, each centered on the release of a new game in each of those series.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Pokémon Go not only enjoys tremendous popular appeal, the game has also captivated the scientific community. The aim of this study was to examine the characteristics and motivations of hardcore Pokémon Go players by analyzing self-reported data from 1630 trainers of level 25 and higher. Males played more and showed more progress in the game than female players. Male players were also more motivated by relatedness and competence, whereas female players were more motivated by experiencing a sense of autonomy. Although the topic of gaming disorder gets a lot of attention in popular press and academia, gaming disorder seems to plays a very limited role in the motivations of hardcore Pokémon Go players. Only 3% of these hardcore gamers reported experiencing the core criteria of gaming disorder: obsessive, compulsive and problematic use of Pokémon Go.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Originated from Japan, games for woman is a type of digital game in which the player socialises with a number of male characters to experience dating and love. As Role-Play-Games, games for woman is a long-term simulation of love with salient group characteristics and strong stimulation. It has been proved to be a breakthrough point for cultural studies of Japanese society, while its function and significance in China remain unclarified.<br />Lover and Producer is an extremely popular game for woman in China, whose download rate hit ten million at the beginning of 2018. This study attempts to answer the female enthusiasm of female players in this game through a nearly one-year virtual ethnography and in-depth interviews with 13 players. Two conclusions have been drawn:<br />First, the design of game characters is accomplished not only by the game developers, but also players and fan art producers. A huge volume of fan art caricatures, novels and videos articulate the diverse opinions and demands of female players, and strengthen their identification of independency. Second, apart from entertainment purpose, the virtual characters are also adored or even worshipped. Some players defend the perfect image of their virtual idols by verbally attacking other characters. Identity contradiction occurs not only between fans of different idols, but also between fans and players with independent female identities.\n",null,"Abstract Body: One of the key tensions in modern video gaming circulates around its openness, or lack thereof. On the one hand, the rise of easily accessible games has led many to argue that the game industry’s traditional focus on young, male audiences is over. Simultaneously, however, gaming culture has seen many exclusionary movements, such as 2014’s #GamerGate harassment campaign. Although GamerGate has been covered extensively, still understudied are the movement’s meaning and impacts for everyday marginalized players. This paper draws on in-depth interviews with female gamers, conducted at two times, to answer these questions. Surprisingly, interviewees revealed that GamerGate was largely insignificant to their day-to-day play; many dismissed it as another instance of the sexism they already faced, while others simply avoided GamerGate conversations. How they discuss the movement, however, is interesting, as they describe GamerGate as a Gramscian crisis of authority and as a potential breaking point for greater change.\n","Abstract Body: RESEARCH PAPER<br />The number of female players grows rapidly in recent years and female-oriented games embrace a large market in China. This study focused on effects of playing female-oriented dating sims on romantic beliefs and gender attitudes toward sexual relationships. Additionally, it investigated mediating effects of parasocial relationships between game exposure and attitudes outcomes. A survey in China with a sample size of 284 participants was utilized to test the hypotheses. This study found that game exposure positively related to parasocial relationships and romantic beliefs. And parasocial relationships had positive associations with both romantic beliefs and gender attitudes. In addition, there were strong mediation effects of parasocial relationships between game exposure and romantic beliefs.<br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> dating sims, parasocial relationship, romantic beliefs, gender attitudes\n","Abstract Body: POSTER PROPOSAL: Based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), the current laboratory experiment investigates how the use of Virtual Reality (VR) technology shapes the gaming experience. We hypothesize that playing the VR version offers a more naturally mapped playing experience than playing the non-VR version of the same game. Further, we assume that natural mapping is positively related to autonomy and competence need satisfaction, which in turn will predict higher levels of game enjoyment. 133 participants were randomly assigned to either play the non-VR or the VR version of the game “Skyrim: The Elder Scrolls V”. We found that playing the VR version induced higher levels of game enjoyment than playing the non-VR version. Path analysis affirmed our assumption that VR technology can increase game enjoyment via natural mapping and the resulting satisfaction of competence and autonomy needs.\n","Abstract Body: The input/output problem of video games (Grodal, 2000) suggest that the output-dominant nature of video game might result in participants playing exact same video game experiencing entirely different content. In order to solve this problem, this paper suggested and validated <i>exo-game<\/i> manipulation – which provides additional background narratives that seems <i>likely to exist <\/i>outside the actual video game – throughout 2 studies. Ultimately, this paper provides evidence that using this technique can improve video game research.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br /><br />POSTER PROPOSAL: The eudaimonic experience of elevation consists of heartwarming and uplifting feelings when witnessing acts of kindness, altruism, sacrifice, or other human virtues. While entertainment research primarily focuses on traditional media such as movies and general eudaimonic experiences, limited research has been conducted regarding digital games and elevation. Previous studies on eudaimonic game experiences have mainly relied on players’ recollections across several games, gathered via in-depth interviews or surveys. The current study takes a different approach: by playing three specific games and taking systematic notes on game experiences shortly after playing, we explore how elevation is generated during gameplay and what game aspects contribute to this. The three studied games were <i>God of War<\/i>, <i>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey<\/i>, and <i>Detroit: Become Human<\/i>. Preliminary results indicate that being involved with the game’s story and characters (i.e., narrative engagement), enhanced by user interface mechanics unique to digital games (e.g., Kratos’ son Atreus calling out in distress when the player’s health is low) are the most important aspects to elicit elevation experiences.\n","Abstract Body: <br />POSTER PROPOSAL. The present study explores the relationship between common virtual reality (VR) movement methods and their subsequent impact on the formation of feelings of spatial presence. This study contributes to the literature by examining the concept of natural mapping from two distinct perspectives/dimensions (i.e., naturalness and intuitiveness). The results are based on a larger dissertation experiment that used a 2 (high interactivity vs low interactivity) X 3 (arm-swinging, teleportation, directional mapping) factorial design. The sample for this study consisted of 183 undergraduate college students. Results indicate that arm-swinging was the most natural movement method, however, teleportation was considered the most intuitive. Furthermore, perceived locomotion intuitiveness was a statistically significant predictor of participants’ feelings of spatial presence while perceived locomotion naturalness was not. This study makes both theoretical and practical contributions to the literature. Theoretically, natural mapping may be a multi-dimensional construct that has implications for the formation of spatial presence. Practically, VR designers should focus on making locomotion methods in VR more intuitive rather than more natural.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Toxicity is pervasive in MMOs. To better understand the consequences of toxic behavior, a mixed effect logistic regression model is applied to a large-scale gaming behavior data. Results show that toxicity will reduce the player's commitment and retention for the game.\n","Abstract Body: POSTER PROPOSAL<br /><br />This study investigates the relationship between immersive virtual environments and users' experience of presence in those environments, through the lens of <i>congruity<\/i>, with implications for both cognitive processing and environmental design. An experimental manipulation of three dimensions of congruity—sensory, environmental, and thematic—is conducted with participants using a virtual reality system: each participant experiences either a control (congruous) or breach condition of a stimulus related to each dimension of congruity.\n","Abstract Body: The common ingroup identity model was examined in the context of gender and gaming. As seen in Figure 1, post-hoc analysis showed a serial mediation of the effect of exposure to a female gamer exemplar on stereotypical beliefs toward the female gamer group. Through making the gamer identity (i.e., common ingroup identity) salient, there was a decrease in stereotypical beliefs toward the example female gamer, and in turn a decrease in stereotypical beliefs toward the female gamer group.\n","Abstract Body: THEORY PAPER- Situating gaming as a cultural practice aimed at constructing issues of power through cultural discussions necessitates a theory of discourse of gaming to explain how meanings around gaming practice develop. Through discourse of gaming, actors both inside and outside of the gaming community iterate, challenge and clarify boundaries of appropriate gaming practice, and present a hierarchy for privileged practices of gaming. Built on the premise that gaming offers a multimodal method for discursive interaction, this manuscript develops a theory of discourse of gaming that connects processes of boundary work, definition making, and legitimization to components of gaming, the gamer, and the effects of gaming (gaming topics). This theory is tested through a survey in Reddit gaming fan communities where gamers discursively responded to issues of violent gaming and finds that violent events serve as a useful method with which the gaming community can solidify the gamer identity.\n","Abstract Body: Female gamers’ self-stereotyping offers important information about their behavior and well-being in the gamer community. However, such an important topic has rarely been studied. In the present RESEARCH PAPER, we tested two theories (i.e., individual mobility, identity bifurcation) that are applicable to self-stereotyping in the female gamer category. Consistent with individual mobility, the influence of female gamers’ stereotype attribution to the group (i.e., ingroup-stereotyping) on their stereotypical beliefs toward themselves as a female gamer (i.e., self-stereotyping) was dependent on the strength of their identification with the female gamer group (i.e., ingroup identification). Consistent with the theory of identity bifurcation, female gamers applied group stereotypes to themselves when they were highly committed to the female gamer identity or when the stereotype was positive. We then applied an integration of the two theories to the data. The results showed that the strength of female gamers’ ingroup identification only significantly moderated the effect of their ingroup-stereotyping on self-stereotyping with negative female gamer stereotypes but not positive female gamer stereotypes. The current research looks beyond the boundaries between two theories and brings in novel perspectives on human communication in the digital environment. Theoretical and practical implications of the results were discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: POSTER PROPOSAL. Based on a sample of 1502 German players of digital games, the current study investigates how gamer identity (GI) and sense of community online (SCO) are related to psychosocial well-being. We hypothesize that experiencing a high sense of community online and strongly identifying with games and other gamers may not only be associated with positive psychosocial outcomes (as indicated in previous research), but could also lead to increases in usage intensity, and, in extreme cases, disordered usage patterns. Based on structural equation modeling, we found a positive connection between GI and higher self-esteem. On the downside, GI and SCO also showed positive associations with higher levels of depression/anxiety and higher gaming disorder scores. We conclude that GI and SCO should not per-se be viewed as positive factors that promote well-being, but as multi-faceted and complex.\n","Abstract Body: Video games are a significant platform for brand messaging. It is predicted to be a multi-billion dollar business by 2020. Brand messaging can be difficult in a complex video game because of each person’s limited level of cognitive capacity. The question is whether there is enough human processing power to play a game well and recall or recognize a brand that has been advertised in the game. This study considers this question with 43 female respondents who played one driving game for an average of 20 hours and drove over 1000 miles in the game. Previous studies with shorter exposure times showed that landmarks were better recognized than integrative messages and integrative messages were better recognized than interruptive messages after play. That finding holds true in this study. Here we also examine changes in brand evaluations from before play and after play. Four brands were evaluated more positively at a statistically significant level by respondents after their time playing: Pizza Hut, Hollywood, Mitsubishi and American Apparel. However there is no evidence of a single, or limited, explanation for memory or evaluation changes from variables in this study. The possibility of the operation of a Mere Exposure effect is currently being explored.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Twitch is the most popular streaming service for videos games worldwide. Though online gaming is known for its toxic masculinity and sexual harassment, research into such behaviors against female streamers and their reactions to it is still sparse. As previous work captured only a fractional amount of the extent of sexual harassment female streamers experience, we propose an automated content analysis approach that can meet rich naturalistic datasets yielded by recorded chatlogs. More specifically, this study proposal focuses on how the number of concurrent viewers and displayed sexualization of the streamer relate to the amount of sexual harassment in the chat. Furthermore, we will quantify the success of different coping strategies (ignoring, accepting, confronting) against sexual harassment.\n","Abstract Body: FULL PAPER: Although women make up approximately 45% of video game players most video games target a male audience. We report an online experiment with 169 college students that varied video game cover artwork in a 2X2 design depicting male and female characters in hyper-sexualized or counter-stereotypic ways. Results indicated that masculine female depiction elicited the most positive responses. These findings have important implications for encouraging more diverse depictions of women in video game advertising.\n","Abstract Body: RESEARCH PAPER. This experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 189) custom-designed a first-person shooter game to examine how violence justification affects player’s feelings of guilt. The study also relied on the Differential Susceptibility to Media Effects Model (DSMM) to examine how post-game perception of the power of guns and player personality influenced guilt. Participants assigned to play as police officers shooting at gang members (i.e., justified violence) felt less guilt than those assigned to play as gang members shooting at police officers (i.e., unjustified violence). Perception of the power of guns did not mediate the relationship between violence justification and guilt. However, overall, through perception of the power, participants high in agreeableness and openness to experience showed more guilt in the unjustified violence game condition. Our findings advanced research on the affective mechanisms triggered by (un)justified game violence and provide evidence for the DSMM in a controlled lab setting. Our experiment's primary contribution is connecting moral disengagement with video game roles, which provide justification for violence, and documenting the influence of player personality, especially agreeableness and openness.<br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>differential susceptibility to media effects model, moral disengagement, personality traits, video games\n","Abstract Body: FULL RESEARCH PAPER: Moral dilemmas have become increasingly popular in video games, although it is still widely unknown why players might find them pleasurable, how they process dilemmas, and which factors affect the processing. Therefore, three different focus groups sessions with expert gamers (<i>N <\/i>= 16) were conducted. Gamers’ expressions of their experience with meaningful and morally relevant game situations were grouped for relevant topics. Topics are supported by direct quotations from participants of discussion groups, referring to up-to-date video game titles and presented together with respective theoretical assumptions. Results show that besides the game-defining theme of interactivity, statements can be grouped broadly into factors that describe why players engage or disengage in the first place (motivation) and factors that shape the moral interaction itself (influencing factors). In summary, our findings support the notion that moral-decision making in video games is a dynamic interplay between several game and user-dependent variables. Findings provide insights into players’ processing of moral dilemmas in video games, which also offers promising suggestions for future research using experimental setups.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: morality, decision-making, video games, qualitative data, focus group\n","Abstract Body: FULL RESEARCH PAPER<br />This study examines how playing a video game featuring a player-character with mental illness can positively impact mental illness stigma. A two-factor, yoked experiment was designed where players either watched or played <i>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice<\/i>, a game praised for its positive portrayal of psychosis. Transportation into the story world, identification with senua, and two aspects of stigma—stereotyping and social distance—were measured. Consistent with hypotheses, a structural equation model found an indirect path from gameplay to reduced social distance through first transportation and then identification. Players reported higher transportation than non-players, and that heightened transportation led to greater identification and then a lowered desire for social distance from the mentally ill. The indirect path to stereotyping was not significant. These results and implications are discussed in detail.\n","Abstract Body: RESEARCH PAPER: Elevation is an eudaimonic experience that consists of heartwarming and uplifting feelings when witnessing kindness, altruism, sacrifice, or other virtues. While eudaimonic media entertainment research primarily focuses on traditional media such as movies, a limited number of recent studies look at eudaimonic game experiences, especially among adolescents. Elevation can be beneficial for adolescents’ development as it potentially increases prosocial and moral attitudes/behaviors. The present study intends to be the first one to gain more insight into players’ elevating game experiences, by questioning how frequently players experience elevation and which personal and game-related characteristics relate to these experiences. In a survey among 207 adolescent players, we found that elevation during gameplay is experienced on some occasions, but not very frequently. Younger adolescents, frequent players, and strongly engaged players experienced elevation more frequently, while the moral principle of loyalty and feeling responsibility for game characters led to more elevation-related prosocial tendencies. Limitations and future research suggestions are further discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Hearing the sound of someone’s heartbeat can be an intimate experience that produces emotional responses in the observer. Non-playable characters (NPCs) are included in video games to provide a social element for players and are often used to communicate with players through a narrative. The presence of the heartbeat may allow an NPC’s message to be more impactful, and subsequently increase player engagement and affection with the NPC. Based on previous work which indicated the potential for heart rates as nonverbal cues, this study explores whether it is critical for a variable heart rate to be in synch with the expressed emotions to bring about more positive evaluations in the observer. Based on social information processing theory, we propose that a varied heart rate which lags the expressed emotions by a few seconds, will result in similar outcomes in observers as a varied heart rate that is in synch, due to expectations of latency in virtual settings. 173 participants watched a recording of a virtual human telling an emotional story with an accompanying heart rate, with the speed and synchronicity of the heart rate manipulated across five conditions. Results showed that varied heart rate conditions which conformed to observers’ expectations of heart rate and emotional content can lead to higher perceived other-arousal, empathy and social presence among individuals.\n","Abstracts: Our work supplements prior research into collegiate esports as a gateway to professionalization by addressing gaming culture’s controversies around race, gender and class. While universities in the US set the economic, institutional and even legal agenda for young athletes, attention to equality and access varies: for instance, athletic departments are often unaware of the haphazard levels of female participation in gaming clubs. Further, industry currently exerts outsized influence: professionalization occurs via platforms like Twitch, while publishers lead regulatory efforts (e.g. Riot Scholastic Association of America). This complicates not only players’ professional paths, but also issues of power, labor, access and representation. Thus, this presentation draws on semi-structured interviews with amateur and varsity student esport players that probe their daily training, development and mastery of skills, along with their relationship (or lack thereof) to endemic issues in gaming culture.<br /><br />Panelist Qualifications:<br />Maxwell Foxman is an assistant professor at the University of Oregon where, along with assistant professors Amanda Cote and Henry Wear, he started an initiative to study collegiate esports through players, institutions and affiliated professions including broadcasting and games coverage. Presenting on this group’s behalf, Foxman’s research focuses on the intersection of games and non-game industries. Within this context, he has examined gamification; the adoption of immersive media and game engines by journalists, educators and filmmakers; and mainstream games journalism. He is currently working on two monographs related to the latter subjects.\n","Abstracts: In this paper we consider the ambivalences surrounding the alleged ‘democratisation’ of game development. Today, commercial game engines such as Unity claim to have ‘democratised’ game development, while various ‘grassroots’ game engines such as Twine, Pico-8, and Bitsy provide community-driven resources that enable fringe developer communities to flourish at the margins of the formal industry. At the same time, developers increasingly find themselves preoccupied with issues of discoverability, as popular distribution platforms become increasingly oversaturated. In this paper, we consider ‘democratisation’ as a site of tension in the game industry—between the ways that formal and informal production cultures each claim to be making game development more inclusive. Drawing on empirical research, we analyse how developers themselves articulate and negotiate the politics of democratisation; how they simultaneously imbue democratisation with promises of openness and equality and anxieties of increased competition and homogeneity.\n","Abstracts: This paper analyzes how indie game development studios use various kinds of dev blogs to interface with audiences. It presents case studies of indie development studios to parse how these forms of communication serve not only as vehicles for information about games but also as a way of pulling back the curtain on the harried, stressful, and often mentally difficult process that is game development. By focusing on the production of not only the game but how the developers understand the process of development itself through these communications, this paper argues that dev blogs serve the additional purposes of managing expectations for players and doing important care work and community building. In sorting through the various ways studios design and communicate their experiences in their blogs, this paper further argues that curating dev blogs helps developers exert control over what often seems like an uncontrollable, harried process.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Male preference and biological sex selection of fetuses is an intersectional feminist issue, as reproductive choices (and, importantly, non-choices) are tied to women’s power. Reproductive choices can be considered a patriarchal bargain, a strategic choice for enhancing one’s own position in a patriarchal system. Preliminary results from a research study of young women in Azerbaijan, where a strong social norm of and public opinion toward male preference dominates reproductive decisions and is one of the few ways of increasing women’s power, finds that women-only social media groups’ discussion of male preference and sex-selective behaviors provide women with incidental exposure to other women adhering to male preference norms, normalizing it, women who have come to terms with male preference, as well as those that deviate from male preference norms. We posit that both normalization and greater acceptance of deviating from norms can be empowering. Many women opt to maintain male preference norms in order to increase their own power; but for those that have come to terms with having a daughter, celebrate daughters, or question male preference, the online support for their choices is beneficial. Moreover, social media exposure to more diverse attitudes about male preference may have larger effects on social norms.<br />\n","Abstracts: There have been widespread calls for the ‘De-Westernizing’ of communication studies, and, more recently, an insistence on the ‘decolonization’ of the field. While the global political economy remains tilted in favour of the Global North and these calls are still urgent, the terms and conditions upon which the South is included in global scholarly discourses are still being contested. In this paper, I focus on attempts to include African scholarship in global communication discourses to argue for an approach that avoids exoticizing in the interest of ‘diversity’ and ‘inclusion’. The demand for a more equitable distribution of global knowledge production is not in the first instance an academic justice argument, nor an appeal to scholarly benevolence or charity. In an era of retreats to populist nationalism in the face of global challenges that demand greater rather than lesser interrelation and interdependence, a decolonized scholarship is, simply, better scholarship. This paper will draw on the notion of ‘Southern Theory’ to argue for such an approach to communication studies in a ‘post-American’ world.<br />\n","Abstracts: Inspired by the ‘China question’ raised by Dallas Smythe in his ‘China Papers’, challenging the ‘capitalist realism’ of media technology and ‘administrative approach’ of US-centered communication studies, this paper aims to reflect on the potential contribution of Chinese communication studies to global discourses. While advocates of Western universalism or Chinese exceptionalism may dismiss the ‘China question’ as an aberrant case against the prevailing Western mode of rationalism and modernity, the paper argues that, instead, it should be turned into a ‘Chinese paradigm’, as a methodological and paradigmatic shift, and a way forward to deal with the ideological crisis in the ‘post-American’ world. Integrating the classical Chinese notion of ‘tianxia’ (under the heaven) with the Kantian precept of ‘cosmopolitanism,’ and taking the construction of digital silk roads as a case study, the paper analyses China’s modes of communicating alternative modernity as part of its ambitious trillion-dollar ‘Belt and Road Initiative’.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: This study investigates the relationships between social connectedness and communicative patterns across the globe. Different from most existing studies that remain their focus on single medium use, it considers people select and combine <i>a set of<\/i> media and communicative patterns for social connectedness. With the survey data from the U.S., UK, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Hungary, and the Chinese mainland, this study explores the complexity of multimodal connectedness, i.e. the diversity and the frequency of multiple media or communicative modalities through which people maintain their connections with different social relations. The latent class analysis identifies six clusters in the diversity and the frequency, respectively, to illustrate similarities and differences of communicative patterns across the seven territories. The theoretical and practical implications of this comparative study are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores one of the most notorious and controversial initiatives by tech corporations to increase connectivity across the Global South: Facebook’s Free Basics project. Public attention focused on its ban in India following nation-wide protests about net neutrality. In Africa, however, Free Basics expanded without much public scrutiny to some 32 countries. This paper traces this quiet expansion by using an innovative VPN-based method and by calling for an analytical focus on the landscape of the digital civil society in Africa. Specifically, I outline two key, interrelated phenomena: 1) Facebook’s evolving strategy, including a greater engagement with civil society organizations; 2) the focus of digital rights activists in Africa on issues like internet shutdowns, government surveillance and the lack of data privacy frameworks. In the process, I illuminate broader trends in the digital industry including tech corporations’ growing investments in mobile social media, network infrastructures, and in civil society; the use of disadvantaged populations and unregulated territories for digital experiments and data extraction; and the mounting recognition of Facebook’s political role, both within and outside the corporation.<br />\n","Abstract Body: About half of the world’s population are not connected to the Internet, and in Africa, data show that only 35% of the 1.2 billion Africans are Internet users. For technology corporations, such as Google, the unconnected represents an untapped potential market that needs to be reached. Google has launched the ‘Next Billion Users’ project to connect the unconnected billions and established ‘Google Station’, a service provided in conjunction with telecom partners to provide free WiFi service in public spaces in India, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand, and recently in Nigeria. Through a critical theoretical articulation of <i>digital coloniality <\/i>this paper examines the political economic rationale of Google’s ‘Google Station’ in Nigeria. It exposes the market logic behind Google’s interest in Nigeria, examines the reactions of Nigerians to this ‘free’ access to the Internet and interrogates what this reveals about the culture of innovation and development in Africa. The paper calls for a decolonial thinking that highlights indigenous technological development. Failure to do this suggests that Africa will continue to rely on foreign capitalist actors for its development whose intent is to mine the market potential of Africa, but often veiled in benevolent guise.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This article examines an internet connectivity effort in a southern state of India. The Andhra Pradesh State Fiber Net Ltd (APSFL or APFiber) is a state corporated established in 2015 that has built a state-wide network of aerial fiber that delivers internet, cable and voice services to roughly 650,000 rural subscribers. The state government’s effort is one of many others to address internet connectivity in rural India, where internet penetration lags drastically behind urban areas. Based on interviews conducted in early 2019, this paper focuses on how the staff at APSFL, some of whom designed the network and others who oversee its operations, understood this connectivity effort. Drawing on critical infrastructure studies, Jasanoff's concept of sociotechnical imaginaries and Hecht's notion of technopolitics, I find that staff made three interrelated cases for connectivity: for growth, for glory and for governance. I argue, however, that the technopolitics of the project do not neatly comply with this imaginary. Rather, APFiber enables the further penetration of the state and capital into the lives of Andhra Pradesh’s citizens and works to re-engineer citizen-state relations and reinscribe state power.\n","Abstract Body: In 2018, China briefly became the world’s largest box office, beating Hollywood’s global take in the first quarter of the year. The country also witnessed a major expansion in the number of movie screens available for domestic exhibition as developers built multiplex theaters in new shopping malls catering to the rapidly rising Chinese middle class. Parallel with these developments, however, has been the reported growth in popularity of Bollywood films in the middle kingdom. After ratifying a co-production treaty with India in 2014, Chinese audiences reportedly began to flock to the newly available Bollywood blockbusters at their local multiplexes, cultivating large fan bases for Indian stars like Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar, and others. In this paper, we analyze publicly available box office data focusing on the expanding market of Indian films in China then review the explanations often given for the rise of Chinese interest in Indian cinema. Given that China reportedly has relatively few Indian residents compared to diasporic locations like North America, Europe, southeast Asian, and the like, we suggest that the high Chinese box office returns reported in the media potentially challenges previous findings linking diasporic enclaves and potential overseas profits. We conclude by reflecting upon how these trends may impact the development of a “Chindian” film market.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores sourcing practices in three international broadcasters in Spanish: China’s CGTN Español, Iran’s TV and Russia’s RT. Often presented as counter-hegemonic, in that their worldview is not in alignment with dominant Anglo-American media, these three State-sponsored TV channels have grown their presence globally in recent years, but remain largely understudied. Drawing on literature about non-elite sourcing, journalistic roles and public diplomacy, we examine the degree to which citizen sources are featured in these three channels, and, when that happens, how are these sources used to advance the foreign policy objectives that inform the broadcasters’ <i>raison d'être<\/i> (i.e. promoting the interest of their home country while challenging the international status quo). To do so, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of news stories broadcast in 2014 and 2017 (<i>N<\/i> = 1,265). Our results show the use of non-elite sources is not ubiquitous but strategic, and is often linked to critical reporting of third countries that are non-political allies. We also present evidence that the practice is not equally common across broadcasters.\n","Abstract Body: In the summer of 2017, <i>Wolf Warrior 2<\/i>, a Chinese action movie broke into the top 100 worldwide grosses of all time at 54<sup>th<\/sup> - the first and only non-English language film listed so far (Box Office Mojo, 2017).  Since its July 27th debut in China, <i>Wolf Warrior 2<\/i> took the market by storm and surpassed 5.5 billion RMB (US$830 million) after just five weeks, which has made it the top-grossing film in China of all time and the second-highest-earning film in a single territory in history, just behind <i>Star Wars: The Force Awakens<\/i><i> (2015)<\/i> in North America (Frater, 2017). Given its phenomenal commercial success, <i>Wolf Warrior 2<\/i> serves as one of the “main melody films” in China, a particular genre in Chinese cinema initiated by the state, which is to wrap up the dominant ideology of a socialist China with pleasurable entertainment and it is among the most important parts of the state ideological apparatus in promoting nationalism (Liu, 2005; Ma, 2013; Su, 2011 & 2014). <i>Wolf Warrior 2<\/i> features “a muscular, adrenaline-fueled story” (Frater, 2017) whose unstoppable hero is a former member of a fictitious Chinese special troops unit called the Wolf Warriors going to a fictional African state in the middle of a civil war to rescue Chinese workers and their African comrades. As a main melody film, <i>Wolf Warrior 2<\/i>, however, embeds the structure of the “hero myth” in its story, a theme that features individualism and American supremacy—a commonly recurring trope in Hollywood blockbusters (Chen, 1998; Lawrence & Jewett, 2002; Ting, 2009). Focusing on its unprecedented commercial accomplishment as a main melody film that features Hollywood narrative and theme, this paper looks into the reasons behind the success of <i>Wolf Warrior <\/i>2 in Chinese market. Through the theoretical lens of critical transculturalism proposed by Marwan Kraidy (2004 & 2005), this paper highlights the triangular interplay among the commercialized Chinese cinema, the state’s virtually split attitude towards Hollywood films, and the business strategies adopted by the producers and investors behind <i>Wolf Warrior 2<\/i>. By deconstructing the film into three parts: financialization of the film, discursive construction of state’s ideology through hero myth, and marketing strategies for distribution, this paper further showcases how the production of main melody film has been challenged and complicated by the market dynamics imposed by China’s tighter integration into the global capitalist system since 1990s.\n","Abstract Body: “Sensing authenticity, seeing aura: Turkish audiences’ reception of Danish dramas”, analyses how Turkish viewers came to regard Danish drama series as authentic and original works of art with a particular <i>aura<\/i>. This was believed to be a truly unique aura that the audiences did not see in drama series originating elsewhere, and certainly not in the US or Turkey itself. The aura was also seen to be entirely irreplaceable and impossible to reproduce in Danish series’ various international remakes, of which the Turkish remake of <i>Forbrydelsen<\/i>, <i>Cinayet<\/i> (Kanal D, 2014) naturally was an important point of reference. The author thus shows the continued significance of artistic aura and authenticity, even in the age of digital reproduction.\n","Abstract Body: This paper aims to deconstruct and critique the way the former, disgracefully ousted Park Geun-hye administration in South Korea deployed the notion of creativity. From the very beginning, Park tried to elevate the creative industries as a new growth engine for the Korean economy. In many ways, the Korean Wave under Park was a revival of her father’s <i>Saemaul Undong<\/i> in the new context of the creative economy in that the both were top-down, centrifugal, unbridled, and, after all, the source of national amour-propre. Using the Foucauldian conception of dispositive, this paper seeks to reveal how the dominant discourse of creativity derived its legitimacy via the Korean Wave and other creative industries. In so doing, it unravels how creativity was used as a buffer against critical public scrutiny. It also elucidates how creativity was used to legitimize the Park administration’s neoliberal-authoritarian politico-economic agenda. The paper then concludes by discussing the implications that Park’s appropriation of the Korean Wave draws for cultural diversity and democracy.\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines media coverage of the murder of Mollie Tibbetts, a white college student, by an undocumented Mexican farmworker in the digital alt-right publication <i>Breitbart <\/i>as a case study to historicize racialized rhetoric of immigration in the American press. This paper situates <i>Breitbart’s <\/i>reporting rhetoric in the context of a hybridized, fragmented media ecosystem. Employing the method of critical discourse analysis, this paper analyzes all articles published within the 24-hour period of the discovery of Tibbetts’ body. This paper argues that the rhetoric and language in <i>Breitbart <\/i>articles demonstrates the re-emergence of racialized tropes and themes that are rhetorically deployed to protect white spaces, the rural national imaginary, and white-dominated structures, the labor market. In a global digital age that heralds the despatialization of culture and the disembedding of populations, <i>Breitbart’s <\/i>reportage demonstrates the salience of place and race for American alt-right audiences and the coactive relationship between digital media outlets and sensationalist, racialized themes that define alt-right political communication.\n","Abstract Body: The largest democratic country in the world is going through a period in its history when the political Hindu/Hindu nationalistic forces have come to exercise power as the ruling dispensation. Indian politics is charting a new course, as never before in its history had the Hindu right-wing enjoyed so much state power, both at the level of the various provincial governments and also at that of the central government (Anderson & Longkumer, 2018; Harriss, 2015; Palshikar, 2015). The latest national general elections in 2019 reinforced the Hindu nationalist stake on state power with a massive verdict in its favour. More than just being in power, the complex of organisations that propel such a narrative of Hindu nationalism is trying to alter the very structure of the nationalist imaginary that resulted out of the anti-colonial movement against the British (Hansen 1999; Jaffrelot, 1995). The Sangh Parivar’s nationalist imaginary is in many ways an ethnically informed form of nationalism which is different from the universalist one that is informed by the progressive modernist ethos and which, for years, has been championed by the Indian National Congress among others (Jaffrelot, 1995). However, this phenomenon is still one that is unfolding and our attempt here will be to examine the various aspects of this discourse that is being propagated by the Hindu nationalist forces in a country that has secularism and universal socio-economic development as one of the cornerstones of its constitution. Palshikar points out that the party political wing of Sangh Parivar – BJP – while trying to project a centrist face, has persistently tried to inject its Hindutva ideology into the mainstream politics of ideas in the country (Palshikar, 2015). This should also be seen in the light of the larger phenomenon around the world where right-wing populist forces are coming to power. This endeavour attempts to throw some insights into the elements of the discourse that these groups propagate and instil in the popular ethos of the respective countries and its people.<br />Further, this is happening in the digital age where Internet and the latest communication technologies have come to play a major role in how people communicate with each other. Papacharissi argues that digital technology, especially Internet, has opened up public spaces for political deliberations, although its transformation to a functioning public sphere is not entirely dependent on the technology itself (Papacharissi, 2002). Of particular relevance is the cognitive dimensions of the Hindutva project, anchoring it in reason and in the re-working of the pedagogy of the nation state (Anderson & Longkumer, 2018). To appeal to the digitally enabled, upwardly aspiring Indian middle classes, which form a large segment of the voter base of the Hindutva parties, the ideology of Hindutva has been re-worked cognitively, working on reason and offering a cognitive infrastructure for the nationalist imaginary. A wide array of digital platforms including blogs and online magazines have emerged that target this “thinking citizen,” positioning Hindutva as the re-worked pedagogy for this citizen, set against the ideology of Western liberalism and secularism.<br />The digital magazine, <i>Swarajya<\/i>, is one such site of pedagogy work of the Hindutva project, working through its digital spaces to re-work the reading of the nation. By drawing on existing literature and conducting a close reading of the right-leaning online portal <i>Swarajya<\/i>, we also examine the effect of Internet technology on the articulation and circulation of political discourse in India. This will further be juxtaposed with the existing power structure and the role of the middle class as active interventionists in these spaces. All these, we hope, will shed light on the nature of right-wing populist discourses and the way they pan out in the Digital Age in India and around the globe. In order to study this, we will first examine the location and influence of middle class in the entirety to Hindutva ideology and movement. We then situate this middle class imaginary of the digital nation as re-worked Hindutva, which we label as Hindutva 2.0. Of particular relevance for our analysis here is the digital cognitive machinery of Hindutva 2.0, particularly attending to the re-working of Indian history as the re-reading of the nation. The digital emerges as a site, we argue here, for re-working the nation, for crafting it as a nationalist, hyper-masculine nation, set against the invaders.\n","Abstract Body: This paper describes a qualitative analysis of social media communication on one Facebook page to illustrate how participation in a homogenous enclave, or echo chamber, reveals the phenomena of affective polarization and dehumanization. We contribute to the research on social identity and dehumanization by using Northrup’s theory of identity in intractable conflict (1989) to show how users’ demonstrate their desire for psychological and physical separation from the other and use dehumanizing language that normalizes potentially dangerous levels of hate during their participation on a Facebook page. We conclude that affective polarization and dehumanization pose a threat to civil discourse and dialogue, as this communication normalizes hatred and reduces the willingness and ability of political opponents to engage in the productive discourse needed for a healthy democracy.\n",null,null,null,null,null,"Abstract Body: Using the culture-centered approach this study examines the lived health experiences of resettled Burmese refugees in a large mid-western city in the United States. Through their narratives in 15 semi-structured in-depth interviews, the participants articulate the cultural and linguistic barriers which prevent them from care-seeking in already low-resource settings. Within such strutural constraints they identify forms of agency and exercie them through strong communical networks, self-medical and traditional healing strategies.\n","Abstract Body: Arsenic, a known carcinogen, naturally occurs in the groundwater in large parts of West Bengal, a state in eastern India. Communities that depend on groundwater face twice the lifetime mortality risk for cancers, cardiovascular diseases and developmental disorders. Arsenic remediation interventions, largely centralized and bureaucratic, involving a host of international, regional and local stakeholders (public health departments, government engineers, community health workers, consultants, hydrologists, etc.) view rural community participation as key to successful arsenic remediation. But what does participation mean for marginalized rural communities that have little choice in their water supply in the backdrop of a geogenic hazard?<br />This paper, based on fieldwork conducted in rural West Bengal, seeks to conceptualize what community participation means to the several stakeholders involved in arsenic mitigation through an initial exploration of “arsenic discourse”. Our exploratory study represents the initial sensemaking step in an ongoing culture-centered ethnography of arsenic poisoning in the region.\n","Abstract Body: The only-child policy was implemented in China from 1979 to 2015, which yields a unique generation of Chinese. They are, or expected to, care for elderly parents without the support from siblings. This study examined the need of social support among the Chinese only children whose parents suffered from cancer. We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 only children whose parents have been diagnosed with cancer within the last five years and analyzed the data with conventional qualitative content analysis. The findings revealed that whether serving as a caregiver decides the types of needed social support among the only children. In detail, the caregivers requested for guanxi, human resources, and economic support, whereas the non-caregivers requested for well-informed and emotional support. However, both the caregiver and non-caregiver groups reported their relatives as the major, if not the only, source of social support.\n","Abstract Body: This study aims to examine how the context of cancer awareness month changes the nature of how people tweet about cancer and to identify who the key cancer information conduits (influencers, engagers, brokers) on Twitter are. We analyzed 36,968 breast, lung, and prostate cancer tweets from February (National Cancer Prevention Month [NCPM]) to March 2018 using topic modelling, and identified cancer influencers, engagers, and information brokers using centrality measures. Results showed that the context of cancer campaigns influenced lung cancer tweets most. While lung cancer tweets focused on positive topics such as prevention, information seeking about e-cigarettes, and new treatments during NCPM, more pessimistic topics were prevalent in the absence of cancer campaigns. As for cancer information conduits, the media were only partially influential in breast and prostate cancer tweets dissemination during NCPM. Other organizations and individuals were more prominent in engaging online communities and brokering cancer information.\n","Abstract Body: Ultraviolet (UV) photography and photoaging visuals make hidden sun damage visible to the naked eye, granting the potential to create messages that vary in temporal dimensionality. The current study examines the moderating effects of loss/gain frames and temporal focus variables on the relationship between temporal framing and sun safe behavioral expectations. U.S. adults (<i>N<\/i> = 897) were assigned to a 2 (visual imagery using a near/distant temporal frame) × 2 (written messages using gain/loss framing) randomized controlled trial. The study demonstrated conditional direct and indirect effects, through fear, of the study factors and temporal focus variables on three behavioral expectations (using sunscreen, seeking shade, and using protective clothing). Results suggest that those who saw the distant temporal frame visual image (i.e., an image of an old man) had increased expectations to seek shade if either their current or past temporal focus was low. There was a negative, conditional direct effect for participants with greater future-oriented consideration for future consequences (CFC) who got distant-framed images within loss-framed written messages on sunscreen behavior expectations. Conversely, there was a positive, conditional direct effect for participants with low future-oriented CFC who received distant-framed images with gain-framed written messages for sunscreen behavior expectation.<br /><br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: temporal frame; loss frame; gain frame; consideration of future consequences; sun safe behavior\n","Abstract Body: Appearing to be a promising antecedent for health behavior and outcomes, health information seeking has gained substantial scholarly attention. However, mixed findings were prevalent in the literature regarding whether and the extent to which health information seeking influences health behavior, and even less research has been conducted to identify factors that explain the health information seeking-health behavior relationship. This research focused on breast, cervical, and prostate cancer screening and utilized the most recently collected Health Information National Trends Survey to examine whether, among population at risk of cancer, cancer information seeking influenced cancer screening via risk perception, efficacy perception, uncertainty and worry. The results indicated that cancer information seeking was associated with prostate cancer screening, but not breast or cervical cancer screening. Across three cancer screening behaviors, uncertainty was a relatively consistent predictor. The relationship between risk and efficacy perception and cancer information seeking was mixed, depending on cancer type. Risk and efficacy perceptions had limited impact on cancer screening behaviors. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Enhancing the public’s knowledge about the risks associated with antibiotics is key to reducing injudicious antibiotic use and slowing the development of antibiotic resistance. Informed by the Risk Information Seeking and Processing (RISP) model, the current study identified predictors of individuals’ seeking and avoidance of information about antibiotic risks and tested the effectiveness of exposure to a RISP-informed video intervention against exposure to a CDC-produced video and a control group. Data (N = 1000) collected from a national sample showed that risk judgement predicted greater negative affect toward risks of antibiotics and lower positive affect toward antibiotic usefulness. In turn, positive and negative affect predicted perceived information insufficiency. Results also showed that information insufficiency interacted with perceived information gathering capacity to predict risk information seeking and avoidance. In addition, information subjective norms and affective responses directly shaped individuals’ information behavior. Comparing the three conditions, results showed that relative to the control group, participants viewing the RISP-informed video had higher levels of risk judgement, perceived current knowledge about antibiotic risks, perceived information gathering capacity, and information subjective norms, as well as lower levels of positive affect toward antibiotics. Implications of the findings for the design of antibiotic stewardship messages are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Previous studies used various risk estimates (i.e., inaction-conditional, action-conditional, and unconditional risk estimates) for perceived susceptibility. We examined how various estimates are differently associate with protection intention and behaviors. In a two-wave panel experiment (Time 1 <i>N<\/i> = 450; Time 2 <i>N<\/i> = 276), using a news article on dental health we manipulated the risk level (high vs low) of gum disease conditional on inaction and action of flossing. We measured inaction conditional risk estimates and behavioral intention at Time 1 and unconditional risk estimate and protection behavior at Time 2. The results showed that information about high (vs. low) inaction conditional risk indirectly led to greater flossing intention, whereas information about high (vs. low) action conditional risk indirectly decreased flossing intention, via changing respective risk estimates. Greater flossing intention and inaction risk estimates at Time 1 significantly increased actual flossing behavior at Time 2. These findings supported both behavioral motivation hypothesis (i.e., positive effect of inaction conditional risk estimate on protection intention and behavior) and risk reappraisal hypothesis (i.e., negative effect of protection intention and behavior on unconditional risk estimate).\n","Abstract Body: Risk perception is a critical determinant for individuals’ health behavior change, especially for behaviors with distal future consequences. This study investigates if and how messages using concrete (vs. abstract) language to describe the negative consequences of opioid misuse and use of images affect people’s risk perception toward opioid misuse. Through the lens of construal level theory and the dual-process model to risk perception, this study examines relationships among perceived concreteness, perceived temporal distance, construal level, negative affect and risk perception. Using a factorial online experiment among Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (<i>N<\/i> = 220), this study found that messages using concrete language increased people’s perceived concreteness of the negative consequences of opioid misuse; perceived concreteness, in turn, increased risk perception both directly and through an increase in negative affect. Use of images decreased perceived temporal distance, which in turn, changed risk perception through an increase in negative affect.\n","Abstract Body: Drawing upon extended parallel process model (EPPM), the present research --- as a formative study of health campaign --- examines how Chinese parents evaluated the threat of tuberculosis (TB) and their efficacy of TB management, and how their appraisals predicted their intention to consult doctors about TB. Results of an online survey (<i>N<\/i> = 1129) demonstrate that Chinese parents were more likely to consult doctors if they had high levels of TB knowledge, believed TB was a severe threat to themselves, and reported high levels of response efficacy and self-efficacy in TB management. Furthermore, threat appraisal and efficacy appraisal interacted to predict the intention of doctor consultation. Post-hoc analysis shows that efficacy appraisal exhibited a curvilinear relationship with doctor consultation, suggesting the boomerang effect of response efficacy and self-efficacy on seeking professional help. These findings provide empirical evidence about EPPM in China, and offer practical implications for TB campaigns.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study presents data from a content analysis of original research articles published in Health Communication and Journal of Health Communication from 2010 to 2019. The authors coded 1,026 articles using categories that identified health topics, theory, population characteristics, and methods used in each study. Distinctions between the published research in Health Communication and Journal of Health Communication are highlighted. Results showed that articles in both journals sometimes lacked racial diversity, covered a wide range of health behaviors, and were primarily conducted in the United States. Results have implications for the state of health communication as a field and indicate directions for how researchers could improve the methodological rigor, sampling procedures, and the utilization of theory within their future studies.\n","Abstract Body: With the continued growth of cancer genetic and genomic (CGT) technologies, understanding how the resulting information is communicated is paramount to transforming and managing cancer prevention and care. In this study, we characterized the use of theory in current research on communication of CGT. Of 513 papers originally identified that focused on communication of CGT, we found that only 119 (23%) used any theory. Behavior Change or Psychology/Health Psychology theories were the most commonly used with little use of Communication theories. Theories were primarily used to guide hypotheses or research question development, and for selecting measures or codes. Half of the papers assessed did not relate their study findings to the theory. Even fewer studies discussed the implications of the findings for the theory. This analysis identified gaps and opportunities for future researchers examining communication processes in the context of CGT.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Gender norms are increasingly recognized as important modifiers of health behavior change interventions. Despite growing awareness of how gender norms shape behavioral expectations within a specific social context, current gender norms scales measure<i> individual<\/i> attitudes instead of beliefs about the <i>social context<\/i>. We used a mixed-methods approach to develop and validate a novel gender norms scale. Based on qualitative data, we generated a pool of 28 items, which we administered in a survey among 3,110 women in Odisha, India. We evaluated psychometric properties using exploratory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. The analysis resulted in two sub scales, “descriptive gender norms” and “injunctive gender norms.” Both subscales represent high internal validity with polychoric alpha values of .84 and .85 respectively. The GNS, gender norms scale, improves on existing measures by incorporating relevant concepts within social norms theory and moving beyond individual attitudes by assessing women’s perceptions of community-level gender norms.\n","Abstract Body: This study builds upon from the cognitive mediation model and examines the relationships between news use, risk perceptions, and knowledge in a specific context of carcinogen-related food risks. In particular, we investigated whether the paths from news attention to knowledge, mediated through elaboration and cognitive risk perception, will be moderated by emotional risk perception. Data were collected through a nationwide survey in South Korea (<i>N<\/i> = 1,000). Results supported (1) the direct path from news attention to knowledge, and (2) the indirect path from attention - elaboration - cognitive risk perception - knowledge, only among those with high levels of affective risk perception. The indirect path from attention - elaboration - knowledge was not supported. The implications and limitations of the findings are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: While the effect size of social media behavioral intervention research varies mostly from none to moderate, researchers indicate that a valuable lesson from the current intervention research is that a lack of theory use may have reduced the success rate of interventions (An, Ji, & Zhang, 2017; Glanz, Rimer, & Viswanath, 2008; Laranjo et al., 2014; Valimaki, Athanasopoulou, Lahti, & Adams, 2016; Webb, Joseph, Yardley, & Michie, 2010; Williams, Hamm, Shulhan, Vandermeer, & Hartling, 2014). However, no research has explored the impact of theories on the effectiveness of social media behavioral interventions. As such, the objective of this study is to conduct an evidence assessment of the previous social media intervention research on health-related behaviors to examine the role of theoretical frameworks in the studies. A total of 11 research articles were collected and categorized into four types, “theory-driven and effective,” “no theory but effective,” “theory-driven but ineffective,” and “no theory and ineffective.” The result shows that theory-driven but ineffective research may have flaws because of sample related ceiling effect, the unclear linkage between theoretical components and the intervention, and adherence problems due to long intervention durations. Confounding effects, the selection of control conditions, and representative and effective sampling are three profound challenges facing the development of social media interventions. Theoretical and empirical implications for social media-based health interventions are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: PrEP is an effective daily prevention medicine used to reduce risks of HIV infections in high-risk populations. Previous research has pointed out the intention-behavior gap on PrEP uptake among gay men. The current study built on research examining how the integrative model of behavioral prediction (IMBP) factors influence PrEP uptake among gay men to explore how actual control variables, namely skills and environmental constraints, moderated the intention-behavior relationship. We used results from formative interviews to construct a survey and collected data from 420 gay men. Results showed that label interpretation skills, lack of access to an LGBTQ-friendly healthcare provider(s), and English fluency had significant main effects on PrEP uptake behavior, while HIV knowledge, lack of access to a healthcare provider, and lack of healthcare system knowledge were significant moderators of the intention-behavior relationship. This study advances our understanding of the IMBP and offers practical implications for PrEP promotion. Limitations and suggestions for future studies are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Objective. Understanding how older cancer patients’ information needs vary is essential for patient-centered health communication. This study aims to develop profiles of older cancer patients based on differences in their information needs.<br />Methods. Two-hundred and twenty-three cancer patients and survivors aged 70 years or older completed an online survey. Information needs (i.e., monitoring coping style and QUality Of care Through the patients’ Eyes) and their contributing factors (i.e., cancer-related psychological distress, ability, motivation, participation in decision making, and demographics) were assessed. Profiles were identified using k-means cluster analysis.<br />Results. Analysis revealed three profiles of patients exhibiting differences in monitoring coping style and type of information needs: the so-called “information seeker” (38.8%), the “listener” (47.2%), and the “information avoider” (14.0%).<br />Conclusion. Our findings revealed a more nuanced perspective to older cancer patients’ information needs by combining two commonly used ways to assess information needs with factors contributing to these information needs.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Many healthcare clinics encourage the use of online patient portals so that patients can have easier access to their health information, yet some patients are hesitant to interact with these portals. We used social cognitive theory to develop and test a theoretically grounded model that incorporates several (1) technological factors, (2) individual factors, and (3) social factors that influence individuals’ post-adoption, active use of patient portals. Based on cross-sectional survey data from a sample of healthcare clinic patients (N = 431), we found that individuals’ severity of illness predicted active use of patient portals and that trust in doctors predicted attitudes toward patient portals. Additionally, attitudes toward patient portals mediated the relationship between technology factors (i.e., perceived ease of use, interactivity, and customization) and active use of patient portals. The paper concludes with a discussion of key findings and implications.\n","Abstract Body: Women have faced persistent problems accessing fertility healthcare. New reproductive health technologies, specifically online fertility specialist consultations and reproductive hormone self-collection tests, present unique opportunities to overcome these issues. This paper extends the Technology Acceptance Model to examine factors that influence women’s intentions to use these new reproductive health technologies. Participants included 327 U.S. women recruited through a national e-newsletter in 2019. A survey assessed perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, risk, trust, subjective norms, responsibility, and intentions to use both technologies. Results indicated that intentions to use online fertility consultations were significantly predicted by usefulness, subjective norms, and responsibility; intentions to use reproductive hormone self-collection tests were significantly predicted by usefulness, ease of use, subjective norms, and responsibility. Widespread uptake of these new reproductive health technologies could promote positive advances in women’s reproductive health outcomes; the results of this study have important implications for theory and health campaign design.\n","Abstract Body: Background: Sweden is rapidly becoming an increasingly multicultural and digitalized society. Encounters between pediatric nurses and migrant mothers, who are often primary caregivers, are impeded by language problems and cultural differences. To support mothers, doulas, who are women having the same linguistic and cultural backgrounds, serve as cultural bridges in interactions with health care professionals. In addition, information and communication technology (ICT) can potentially be used to manage interactions owing to its accessibility.<br /><br />Objective: The objective of this study was to investigate the role of ICT in managing communicative challenges related to language problems and cultural differences in encounters with migrant mothers from the perspectives of Swedish pediatric nurses and doulas<br /><br />Methods: Deep semistructured interviews with five pediatric nurses and four doulas from a migrant-dense urban area in western Sweden were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic content analysis.<br /><br />Results: The results showed that ICT contributes to mitigating communicative challenges in interactions by providing opportunities for nurses and migrant mothers to receive distance interpreting via telephones and to themselves interpret using language translation apps. Using images and films from the internet is especially beneficial while discussing complex and culturally sensitive issues to complement or substitute verbal messages. These findings suggest that ICT helps enable migrant mothers to play a more active role in interactions with health care professionals. This has important implications for their involvement in other areas, such as child care, language learning, and integration in Sweden.<br /><br />Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that ICT can be a bridging tool between health care professionals and migrants. The advantages and disadvantages of translation tools should be discussed to ensure that quality communication occurs in health care interactions and that health information is accessible. This study also suggests the development of targeted multimodal digital support, including pictorial and video resources, for pediatric care services.<br /><br />The paper is published in JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32181748\n","Abstract Body: Communicating with health providers through online patient portals brings many benefits. It remains uncertain why patients do not use them. Using the Technology Acceptance Model, this paper aims to test how editability, persistence, and communication efficacy influence patients’ understanding about the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norm, attitudes, and finally their intention to communicate on patient portals. An online survey was conducted. Results, theoretical, and practical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: As students begin interacting with patients and engaging in clinical activities and responsibilities in the third year, they may encounter uncertainty they did not expect, or their uncertainty may shift. Toward understanding this larger phenomenon, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of students’ intolerance of and reactions to uncertainty over the course of the third year, as these factors may shape how students approach patient encounters during these formative years. We surveyed 273 medical students at four time points during their third year. Repeated measures ANOVA results revealed that intolerance of uncertainty and most reactions to uncertainty did not significantly change over the course of the third year, though downward trends in concerns for bad outcomes and reluctance to disclose uncertainty to patients were marginally significant. Regression analysis showed that intolerance of uncertainty predicted reactions to uncertainty that included anxiety, concerns for bad outcomes, and reluctance to disclose uncertainty to preceptors. Overall, results suggest that medical school training needs to normalize the experience of medical uncertainty and equip students with the skills to manage their uncertainty, their reactions to it, and the effects uncertainty may have on their patient-provider and student-preceptor relationships.\n","Abstract Body: Experts have recently argued that guidelines to take a full course of antibiotics are due for revision, instead recommending that patients stop when they feel better. It is unknown how communicating revised guidelines from medical experts about how long to take a course of antibiotics will affect beliefs, behavior, and trust in guidelines more generally. In a pre-registered experiment, we use a national sample of 1,263 participants from UK to test the effects of a message that reverses the prior full-course guideline versus a status quo message of take the full course). We also test a secondary intervention that emphasizes that medical guidance and evidence may change over time. Early stoppage messages shifted personal beliefs and perceived expert consensus about early stoppage (a shift of 13.8% to 17.9%, p < .001) and behavioral intent (a shift of 15.3% to 21.8%, p < .001) in the intended direction. However, the new guideline also slightly decreased acceptance of uncertainty about future guidelines (a decrease of .2% to 3.1%, p = .022) and general intention to comply with other guidelines in the future (a decrease of 2.6% to 8.4%, p < .001), but did not affect perceptions of medical researchers’ or doctors’ credibility or respondents’ epistemic efficacy. Prior belief about early stoppage did not moderate receptivity to messages. Notably, though, we also find receptivity to early stoppage messages was contingent on deference to experts. We find no effect of a secondary intervention that emphasizes that medical guidance and evidence may change over time. Overall, our findings suggest that the (U.K.) public is likely to accept new guidelines that change long standing advice to take a full course of antibiotics. While respondents show wariness about further future revisions, these\n","Abstract Body: Continuing medical education is an important strategy for communicating emerging science to health care providers. This study reports findings from a summative evaluation of the effects of two online continuing medical education units that focused on research from the Breast Cancer and Environment Research Program. The goal of summative evaluation is to determine whether outcomes have changed between baseline and follow-up measures. Therefore, pediatric health care providers and nurse practitioners completed surveys before, immediately after completing the CME training, and again approximately three weeks later. The survey measured knowledge, attitude, intention, and self-reported adoption of recommendations from the online training. Results provide evidence that continuing medical education can be effective in influencing pediatric health care providers’ knowledge gain, attitudes, intent, and, ultimately the adoption of CME recommendations.\n","Abstract Body: Introduction:<br />Antibiotic-resistant infections, driven by unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, are a growing threat to public health (Smith et al., 2015; CDC, 2018). In the U.S., approximately 50% of antibiotic prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections (URIs; e.g., colds, bronchitis, sinusitis) is unnecessary (Fleming-Dutra et al., 2016).<br /><br />Over-prescribing is often attributed to patient expectations for antibiotics (Yates et al., 2018) resulting from patient knowledge deficiencies about the risks associated with antibiotic consumption. However, recent work (Foley et al., 2018) suggests that providers’ own ways of talking about antibiotics in medical encounters could inadvertently sustain inaccurate views about antibiotic treatment and thereby undercut motivation for antibiotic stewardship. Patients who are not made aware of the risks associated with taking antibiotics will likely retain the widely-held misconception that antibiotics are harmless, and can be taken with impunity. This, of course, is not accurate, as there are many short- and long-term risks of taking antibiotics ranging from stomach upset and nausea to <i>chlostridium difficil<\/i> (c. diff) and antibiotic resistance (CDC, 2018). In an effort to support the development of effective provider strategies for communicating about antibiotics with patients, the present study was designed to address the following research questions:<br /><br /><i>RQ1: What is the frequency and nature of provider discussions about antibiotic risks when discussing treatment options for URIs during primary care visits?<\/i><br /><br /><i>RQ2: Does provider discussion about the risks of antibiotic treatments impact outcomes relevant to antibiotic stewardship, such as trust in provider, patient satisfaction, confidence monitoring and managing URI symptoms, and evaluation of the treatment advice?<\/i><br /><br />Method<br />A quantitative behavioral analysis of provider-patient visit transcripts (patient N = 526; provider N = 18) was conducted to identify provider talk about the risks associated with antibiotic treatment. Transcripts were extracted from a larger study of medical visits for URI symptoms at a high-volume outpatient practice between September, 2017 and April, 2018. Coding scheme development occurred inductively from notes on 20% of transcripts (n = 105). Our analysis revealed four types of risk discussions (Table 1): (a) antibiotic resistance (b) allergic reactions (c) non-allergy side effects (e.g., diarrhea, upset stomach), and (d) other risks. Upon achieving intercoder reliability on all four categories (α = 0.78-0.9), a team of undergraduate research assistants coded the remaining randomly assigned 421 transcripts.<br /><br />One day following their visits, patient participants were emailed a survey examining evaluations of and actions following their visit. Survey measures included trust in provider, satisfaction with care, confidence in ability to monitor and manage URI symptoms, and evaluation of treatment advice. A regression analysis was employed to test the association between provider risk talk and survey outcomes.<br /><br />Results and Discussion<br />Results indicate that providers infrequently discuss antibiotics in the course of treatment discussions with patients. Only 13.7% (n = 72) transcripts included talk about antibiotic risks. While the vast majority of transcripts did not include any risk talk, a small fraction (2.5%; n = 13; Table 2) contained two to three risk talk categories.<br /><br />Provider discussion of antibiotic risks was not significantly associated with patient evaluations of provider trustworthiness, visit satisfaction, confidence managing and monitoring URI symptoms, or evaluation of treatment advice. These findings are likely the result of the low frequency of providers’ antibiotic risk talk.<br /><br />The lack of provider risk communication observed in this sample is problematic as it has it can sustain patient misconceptions about the harms of antibiotics and suggests that providers may be underestimating their potential to influence patient knowledge and behavior (Cabral et al., 2016; MacGeorge et al., 2017). Results highlight the need for theoretically-grounded strategies for conveying antibiotic risks during treatment discussions in primary care.\n","Abstract Body: Virtual patients are interactive digital simulations of clinical scenarios to health professions education. Although shared decision making (SDM) skills are increasingly important, these skills are often underdeveloped among clinicians. This study aimed to conduct a pilot-evaluation of an interactive, computer-simulated virtual patient-based eLearning to train SDM skills of clinicians. Twenty-six medical students participated in two interactive sessions with a virtual patient (VP), while being provided with feedback. Their interactions were videotaped and the participants' SDM skills during the sessions were assessed quantitatively by two coders. In addition, the eLearning was evaluated qualitatively by using open ended questions. The results showed that the ability to apply SDM during the consultation with the VP improved significantly after the first session. However, the qualitative evaluation revealed that further improvement is needed, particularly on the text corpus of VPs. Despite needs for improvement, participants also mentioned several positive points about the eLearning module and the VPs. It can thus be concluded that using a VP-based eLearning seems to have potential as a valuable learning opportunity for the training of SDM communication skills.\n","Abstract Body: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) affect millions of people annually, costing $16 billion in direct costs each year. Young adults often avoid communicating with their romantic partners about STIs for fear of stigma, thereby limiting their own and their partners’ ability to make informed and accurate health decisions. Using Communication Privacy Management theory as the theoretical framework, this study investigates how young adults in romantic relationships communicate about STIs with their partner. Findings show that participants report having conversations about STIs, but do not engage in regular STI testing, thereby limiting their ability to provide accurate information. They also discuss STIs in general rather than the communicating about their own history with STIs, being tested for STIs, or discussing STI test results with their partners. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Background<\/i><br />Previous research has investigated the impact of social support on diabetes self-management and health outcomes (Rosland et al., 2008; Strom & Egede, 2012). Studies show that both the support by healthcare professionals (Patel et al., 2018; van Dam et al., 2003) and by the private social patient network (e.g., relatives/friends) (Armour et al., 2005; Whitehead et al., 2018) influence diabetes self-management adherence and outcomes. Recent studies increasingly look at social support for diabetes self-management delivered through mobile online technology (<i>mHealth<\/i>, e.g. Burner et al., 2018), such as diabetes management apps. In this context, most mHealth studies either consider social support as an outcome of mHealth use, or mHealth as a means for delivering social support. To advance health communication research, we argue that social support fulfills a further role: As implicated by technology adoption models, social support can also <i>influence the mHealth use<\/i>. Therefore, we examine the influence of support by healthcare professionals (physicians) and support by the private social patient network (family/friends) on the use of diabetes self-management apps. We postulate differences between the impact of professional versus non-professional support on app use.<br /><br /><i>Method<\/i><br />We used a triangulation of methods that included explorative semi-structured face-to-face interviews (N=21, study 1) and an online survey (N=65, study 2) with adult type 1/2 diabetes patients to examine the influence of social support on diabetes app use. Thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) was applied to the interview transcripts, which delivered a detailed understanding of the relevance of social support for diabetes app use (study 1). Binary logistic regressions were applied to the survey data (study 2) to compare the support by healthcare professionals with the support by the private patient network as predictors of diabetes app use, complemented by other predictors from self-management and technology adoption theory.<br /><br /><i>Results<\/i><br />The interviews (study 1) showed that shared decision-making and supportive communication, including communication about diabetes technology, were reported to vary depending on the medical specialty of the supervising physicians, with patients perceiving support by diabetes specialists as more helpful than by general practitioners. Patients comprehensively supported by specialists in structured diabetes programs reported long-term diabetes app use, while patients who were supervised by general practitioners and were dissatisfied with the supervision used diabetes apps to a low extent. The private patient network was perceived as either facilitating or hindering the mHealth use for self-management, depending on supportive or unsupportive behaviors of the network..<br />Binary logistic regressions (study 2) confirmed the interview results, showing that the specialty of the physicians providing care predicted the use of diabetes apps, with supervision by diabetes specialists increasing the likelihood of the app use (as opposed to general practitioners). In addition, specialist care was positively related to higher shared decision-making and better physician-patient communication. The support by the private patient network also predicted the use of diabetes apps. The likelihood of diabetes app use increased with lower social support by family or friends and decreased with higher support.<br /><br /><i>Conclusion<\/i><br />Overall, the results deliver a first confirmation of the differences between the impact of professional and non-professional support on diabetes app use. We especially discuss why the use of diabetes apps may increase when there is less social support by family/friends (e.g., compensation for lack of support), or why the app use may decrease when support is higher (e.g., no perceived need to use technology). Implications for health policy and practice include the need to discuss an appropriate inclusion of the private patient network in diabetes care, as well as how to deal with differences in specialist versus general practitioner care.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores the non-sharing of health information by older adults in everyday social settings and interactions. The novelty and relevance of the study lie in the fact that it explores an uncultivated area of information behaviour, as very few studies have examined information non-sharing. Forty qualitative in-depth interviews were held in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking northern part of Belgium, with adults between the ages of 50 and 80. Thematic data analysis in conjunction with the grounded theory approach was used to identify non-sharing behaviour and compare findings with the scarce amount of literature. By employing the concepts of health orientation, avoiding, uncertainty management, and self-disclosure, we construct a contextual framework to understand health information non-sharing (HINS). Seven key themes emerge which explain HINS; 1) health as a non-topic, 2) avoid being labelled ill, 3) individual responsibility, 4) avoid burdening others, 5) lack of trust in others, 6) lack of trust in the internet, and 7) avoiding information overload. Typically, non-sharing appears the result of conscious choices, contrary to information sharing, which is often spontaneous and unplanned. Non-sharing is a new and valuable addition to the (health) information behaviour landscape.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Through the use of text mining and semantic network analysis, this paper identifies patterns of supportive communication during discussions of loss within online infertility support groups. Unlike previous studies that employ these methods, this paper makes explicit the rhetorical epistemology inherent in semantic network analysis. Through a semantic network and rhetorical analysis, this paper examines 60 of the top posts of all time from the r/Infertility subreddit, finding that supportive communication was enacted through de-personalizing the loss, validating anger, and accepting alternative routes to motherhood. Theoretically, this discourse suggests that a pervasive medicalization and chemical rhetoric is imbued into the narratives of women dealing with loss. Practically, identifying the forms of supportive communication that are most frequently used within an online community provides useful insights for friends, family members, and medical professionals who are struggling to offer helpful, empathetic support.\n","Abstract Body: Most Millennials and Generation Z young adults own smartphones and are texting at a rate of over 100 messages a day (Gibson & Cartwright, 2014). Considering how embedded communication technology is within these populations, scholars should further explore its influence on social support and mental health. Studies on computer-mediated social support among Millennials and Gen Zers have produced inconsistent results. This research utilizes Stress Buffering Model (Cohen & Willis, 1985) to analyze how computer-mediated social support affects Millennials’ and Gen Zers’ mental health outcomes (stress, depression, social isolation, and suicidal ideation). This study also investigates their perceptions of computer-mediated counseling services, and the likelihood that they will engage in online therapy. Survey results from 3,710 Millennial and Gen Z college students illustrate the moderating effects of computer-mediated social support on their mental health as well as their perception of the quality and likelihood of use of computer-mediated counseling services. These results highlight the effectiveness of computer-mediated social support and the positive perception Millennials and Gen Zers have when it comes to online counseling services. This paper deepens the understanding of how computer-mediated communication can be utilized in order to help prevent negative mental health outcomes and delivers insights into the ways in which new communication technologies will serve newer generations in ways never before thought possible.<br /><br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: computer-mediated social support, mental health, computer-mediated counseling, online therapy\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study aims to expand the Theory of Normative Social Behavior (TNSB) by testing the moderating role of contextual (i.e., interpersonal communication) and individual (i.e., involvement) level attributes in normative influence on health prevention behaviors with different behavioral attributes (i.e., behavioral privacy). Study 1 investigated the moderating effect of interpersonal communication in normative influence on private and non-private types of health prevention behaviors. Our findings support the idea that interpersonal communication moderates the effect of descriptive norms on HIV prevention behavior (private), but there interaction effect was not found in non-private health behavior. Study 2 tested the moderating effect of interpersonal communication in normative influence on HIV prevention behaviors among people with more involvement in HIV issues. This study also explored whether the relationship is different depending on one’s level of HIV involvement. We found that the moderation effect of interpersonal communication on relationship between descriptive norms on HIV prevention is different between people with higher involvement and those with lower involvement in HIV.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Despite the risk poor birth outcomes, roughly half of women who smoked prior to pregnancy do not quit. To support theory refinement and improve interventions, it is useful to unpack the ways in which interpersonal influencers may affect those trying to stop addictions, including approval norms, presence, triggering, modeling, and environmental facilitation. National survey data were collected on 576 pregnant women who smoked immediately prior to pregnancy. As expected, tobacco use was related to proximity to smoking, friends’ injunctive norms, partner reductions in smoking, and mother smoking during own pregnancy. In turn, proximity to smoking was predicted by smoking policies at home and work, descriptive norms for friends and housemates, and friends’ injunctive norms. Thus, proximity to people doing the addictive behavior, which can be targeted by interventions, is a powerful influence that inhibits cessation and helps explain the impact of descriptive norms. Partners should also model reduction behaviors.\n","Abstract Body: Prevalence of mental disorder diagnoses is steadily rising, creating a need for organizations to develop strategies to accommodate affected employees. Stigmatization of mental disorders creates a barrier to the development of effective accommodations. The presented study investigates communication strategies organizations may use to foster open dialogue with employees impacted by mental illness. The study investigates how persuasive messages communicating a social norm impact identification with and willingness to disclose mental difficulties to an organization, evaluations of and intentions toward said organization. A 2 (persuasive message: social norm v. non-social-norm) by 2 (message format: narrative v. non-narrative), vignette-based online experiment was conducted among employed American adults working a minimum 32 hours per week, with self-reported experience of anxiety (<i>N <\/i>= 251). While an effect of messaging on central variables was not detected, the study discovered that identification influences willingness to disclose anxiety and subsequent evaluations of and intentions toward the organization, spurred by severity of reported anxiety. A thematic analysis of open-ended responses to corporate messages revealed the potential for social norm messages to evoke a boomerang effect on organizational evaluations. Implications are discussed in terms of the complexity messaging strategies might enact on workplace communication about mental illness.\n","Abstract Body: Research testing the risk perception attitudes (RPA) framework has demonstrated that efficacy beliefs can heighten or attenuate the effect of risk perceptions on behavior. This ability of efficacy to moderate the influence of psychosocial factors on behaviors has also been seen at the social-level through tests of the theory of normative social behavior (TNSB). We tested the ability of efficacy to act as a bridge between normative factors at a social-level and risk perception factors at an individual-level. Data for this study come from the Reduction in Anemia through Normative Innovations (RANI) project’s baseline survey in Odisha, India. We used hierarchical linear equations to analyze interactions between individual and community level predictors and efficacy to predict behavioral intention. Descriptive, injunctive, and collective norms, and risk perception were all positively associated with intention. However, efficacy beliefs also moderated the effect of injunctive norms (β = 0.07, <i>p<\/i> < 0.01), collective norms (β = 0.06, <i>p<\/i> < 0.01), and risk perception (β = 0.04, <i>p<\/i> < 0.01) on intentions. This study demonstrates the ability for efficacy to act as a bridge between individual and community level factors, and we present preliminary evidence for a multilevel theoretical framework.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates how news media cover e-cigarette-related issues in the US, UK, and Korea. People have relied on news media risk information to protect themselves from health threats (Allen, 2002). However, risk news is a socially constructed product, affected by scientific evidence, but also by its social, political and economic context (Brüggemann, 2014).<br />The debate on e-cigarettes provides a good example to show how news define and assess health risks. The purposes of the study are to address (a) how similarly or differently the arguments regarding e-cigarettes are presented in the news media in the US, UK, and South Korea, (b) which arguments were under-represented, (c) to what extent scientific research shapes the arguments, and (d) how limitations of scientific studies are linked to argumentation. 603 news articles containing 2395 arguments were coded for the period between 2008 and August 30, 2019.\n","Abstract Body: This study seeks to characterize e-cigarette tweets shared by robot accounts on Twitter. Given that these types of messages may influence populations engaging in high use of social networking sites, it is vital to understand the nature of these tweets and the accounts from which they are shared in order to identify and counter these messages with impactful public health messaging. Tweets (N=636) from suspected Twitter robot accounts advocating the use of e-cigarettes to determine patterns and themes emerging from the data. We used a mixed methods approach to first perform a thematic analysis of qualitative data collected between October 2015 and February 2016 and identify thematic categories. We then quantified how many times each thematic category was observed in the data. Implications of this research are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Background: Unregulated e-cigarette advertising may be one of the reasons e-cigarettes have become so popular among young people. The current study examined how simulated regulated advertising environments impacted e-cigarette use.<br />Methods: Participants (<i>N <\/i>= 60) were 12-hours nicotine abstinent, young adults who were ever e-cigarette users. Upon consenting, participants were assigned to one of three ad viewing conditions: 1) modified ads – people omitted, 2) modified ads – descriptors omitted, or 3) unmodified ads – all features left intact. Participants then completed a vaping latency task during and were recorded for number of puffs and time to first puff.<br />Results: Results showed that while there were no differences in time to first puff between the modified ads, those who viewed the unmodified ads had significantly less time to first puff compared to those who viewed the modified ads (<i>p<\/i>s < .05). There were no significant differences in ad type predicting number of puffs.<br />Discussion: Modifying e-cigarette ads to omit appealing features, such as people or descriptions of the product, may be especially useful in decreasing e-cigarette use among young adults.\n","Abstract Body: Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of College Students and Vaping<br /><br />EXTENDED ABSTRACT<br /><br />Introduction<br /><br />As overall usage rates of e-cigarettes are increasing at exponential rates,<sup>1-2<\/sup> young adult college students are more likely to use e-cigarettes than members of the general population. The growing rates of e-cigarette use among a non-cigarette-using adolescent population represents a major public health risk.<sup>3-6<\/sup> The purpose of this study was to determine young adult, college students’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding electronic cigarettes.<sup>7-9<\/sup><br /><br />The theoretical framework of Diffusion of Innovation where scholars examine knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) in innovation adoption is well-established within health communication.<sup>10-12<\/sup> However, research on understanding the proliferation of electronic cigarette use among college youth through the KAP framework is nascent. Using a KAP approach, we draw from diffusion of innovations theory<sup>10-12<\/sup> to explore the ecological system of knowledge, attitudes, and practices of college students in regards to e-cigarettes. The resulting study will contribute to understanding the adoption and diffusion of e-cigarette use in young adult populations.<br /><br />Method<br />Using a KAP approach, a focus group study was conducted with young adults. Participants were undergraduate students at a Midwestern university, receiving extra credit through the school’s SONA system. Eight focus groups, with 26 participants (n=24 females; n=21 Caucasian), including e-cigarette (past 30-day) users (n=18) and non-users (n=7), were conducted in April/May 2019, and an additional four groups will be completed by December 2019. The focus groups are designed to inform an e-cigarette message intervention and evaluation in the campus community. After the initial round of focus groups, data were examined to identify the knowledge, attitudes and practices of young adult e-cigarette users and non-users.<br /><br />Results<br />Preliminary analysis shows three salient findings, which we describe briefly below (Table 1, for quotes). First, e-cigarette users reported a great deal of knowledge uncertainty, particularly in regard to the health risks associated with vaping. This lack of precise information was also reported by non-users, however they reported being more risk averse in regards to their perception of this uncertainty.<br />Second, while participants seemed to agree that e-cigarettes were more acceptable than traditional cigarettes, contextual variation on favorability was found. On the one hand, social use at bars or parties was considered to be acceptable, however, they had less tolerance for daily, habitual use in public. Nicotine addiction was a concern, but there was variation over the extent to which participants saw themselves as susceptible. An attitudinal distinction was made between owning a device (habitual) and using a friends (social).<br />Finally, the data reflect some unique practices around vaping, including linguistic patterns, acceptable social behaviors, and novel practices in response to barriers that both inhibited and supported use. Participants describe a language that has evolved around vaping and feeling quite comfortable approaching a stranger and asking, “Can I hit that?” at a bar. Cost concerns and regulatory (limiting of flavors) barriers led to practices that include refilling pods and purchasing from non-traditional venues.<br /><br />Conclusions<br />E-cigarette use among college students is characterized by knowledge uncertainty, contextual variation, and unique practices, potentially motivating use and social acceptance that may pose long-term risks. Screening and education regarding e-cigarettes should be included within campus settings. Future research identifying appropriate target messages for intervention and evaluation is necessary. The paper concludes with a discussion connecting the KAP approach to appropriate communication strategies in order to prevent use and misuse of e-cigarettes and to improve campus policy enforcement. This study could provide insights for designing similar interventions in other young adult populations.<br /><br />References<br /><br />1.

Active health information seeking may facilitate a better understanding of e-cigarettes. Using the risk perception attitude (RPA) framework and identity theory, this study examined how smokers’ perceived efficacy of switching completely to e-cigarettes, perceived risk of cigarette smoking, and smoking identity predict their intentions to seek information about e-cigarettes. Results revealed a significant three-way interaction. Among smokers with high smoking identity, the relationship between perceived risk and intentions to seek information about e-cigarettes was stronger at low vs. high levels of perceived efficacy. Among smokers with low smoking identity, perceived efficacy and risk did not interact; increasing either efficacy or risk beliefs would predict higher levels of information seeking intentions about e-cigarettes. This study extends the RPA framework and helps understand audience segments differing in motivations to search for information about e-cigarettes.\n","Abstract Body: <br />Cardiovascular disease specifically coronary heart disease is a health disparity plaguing many communities around the world. The disease is found to be more rampant among populations that face complex barriers toward achieving equitable health outcomes. In Asia, these factors include socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender, and cultural disenfranchisement.  Building on this evidence of disparities among different ethnic groups in various societies globally, we argue that it is necessary to study heart health through the lens of inequality, theorizing heart health as an expression of inequality. This research splices disparities further by specifically interrogating heart health meanings through the lens of low-income Malay Singaporeans that are socio-economically disenfranchised. The intersection of race and socioeconomic status is a starting point for understanding heart health challenges faced by the community. The study adopts a culture-centered intervention, building with the community meanings of heart health for the purposes of health communication solution configurations.\n","Abstract Body: This paper uses localocentricity as a culture-centered theoretical frame to document how research participants who have knowledge of or experience in sex work communicate about health and HIV and AIDS. Localocentricity as a theoretical lens interrogates the philosophy of universalized knowledge practices, and advances the need to centralize local narratives in order to understand local health needs of individuals and communities living at the margins of society. Localocentricity thus serves as an agent of ‘open science’ in how it makes transparent the local immediacies that frame knowledges of those at the margins and how paying attention to these local immediacies are critical to addressing unique health needs of marginalized communities such as those of transgender women in sex work. We conclude that our research participants clearly articulate their extreme marginalized status, point to mental health as critical to their negotiating health, and present a divided discourse on HIV and AIDS. <br /> <br />\n","Abstract Body: Globalization has fostered precarious economies, constituted amidst expulsion of people from their livelihoods and migration of labour especially from relatively poorer countries to developed countries. One such group of migrant labour are nurses, constituted in feminised reproductive labour of neoliberal care economies. Migrant nurses, who are one of the most significant lifelines of the health labour force are intertwined with New Zealand's health priorities amidst its neoliberal transformation. Despite the rising number of migrant nurses in the healthcare sector of New Zealand, the voices of migrant nursing communities are traditionally absent from conventional health policies and discourses. Utilising the Culture-Centered Approach (CCA), the study aims to understand the meanings of health held by the migrant Indian nurses as they negotiate living and working in New Zealand.\n","Abstract Body: This article concentrates on exploring relations between identity transformation and occupational disease experienced by migrant workers in Shenzhen, China. In combination of identity transformation theory and culture-centered approach (CCA), this research addressed the question that how migrant workers constructed the transformation of identity while suffering from occupational diseases. With the method of interviewing 20 poisoned migrant workers and observing their daily life in hospital, narratives of their struggles to acquire legitimate identity of patients contracted occupational diseases were recorded. The result showed the process of identity transformation was constituted by 4 stages. In the plot stage, the migrant workers with occupational diseases experienced constant conflicts that rendered their identity transformation incomplete. In the stage of result, the disruption of illness to life as well as culture dilemma made the construction of occupational disease identity a secret or a shame. In the stage of discursive space, the cultural members challenged the dominant discourses when interacting with the social system. In the stage of practice, migrant workers had the agency to make health practices to resist the marginalization process caused by the identity of occupational disease. Some practical suggestions for improving policy on prevention and treatment of occupational disease are provided in the end.<br />\n","Abstract Body: In response to the increasing rates of HIV/AIDS among Chinese college students, this study investigated the informational, motivational, behavioral, and cultural factors affecting Chinese female college students’ sexual behavior and safe sex practice. By applying a culture-centered approach to expand the information-motivation-behavioral skills (IMB) model of AIDS-preventive behavior, an online survey was conducted on a purposive sample of 1284 female Chinese college students. The study lent support to the IMB model in a non-US context. More importantly, this study revealed different patterns of the roles that various gender values play in the current sexual culture in China. Holding traditional sexual values would refrain young females from engaging in sexual intercourse at all, while feminine gender role value encourages young females to give up on their assertiveness in negotiation and to engage in more sexual intercourse but with less safety.\n","Abstract Body: We propose a culture-centered approach to health intervetion in the context of the epidemic of farmer suicides unfolding in Maharashtra, India among cotton farmers in the backdrop of neoliberal transformation of agriculture in the Global South that enabled multinational corporations to introduce new, constly ways of farming. We foreground the voices of the farmer-widows who must live for the children after their husbands' deaths and face the conditions of precarity and capital intensive farming amid the patriarchal gender relations in agriculture. The anchors for health intervention emerge in this study through co-construction of lived experiences of the farmer widows in dialogue with the researchers. The culture-centered approach adopted in this research contends that the strategic function served by communication scholarship that supports the psychosocial models of health intervention in the marginalized contexts reinforces and reproduces the global inequalities, discursively marginalizing local cultures, and structurally disenfranchising the poor populations. Our research explores the creative potential of the culture-centered approach to construct health interventions based on ethnographic engagement and construction of narratives in dialogue with cultural participants.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Background and Objectives: The purpose of this article was to examine the ways in which a “tuakana-teina” peer education intervention (1) developed the capacity of Māori kaumātua (elders) as tuakana/peer educators and (2) had positive impacts on their sense of purpose and health and wellbeing.<br />Research Design and Methods: Kaupapa Māori and community-based participatory research principles guided the peer intervention. It involved 26 tuakana peer educators for 121 other kaumātua (teina) facing various later life transitions. We used mixed methods comprising a pre- and post-test, clustered staggered design. Participants completed baseline and post-intervention assessments of health and wellbeing consistent with Māori worldviews. Five focus groups were held with 22 teina and one with five tuakana.<br />Results: Tuakana communication skills were rated as high by teina and independent assessment of conversations. Qualitative analysis supported the importance of Māori communication skills for the role. Further, three measures increased significantly from the baseline to the final period for tuakana account for about 15% of the variance in these variables; sense of purpose (p=.07), self-rated health (p=.05), and health-related quality of life (p=.04). Qualitative analysis supported the benefits of the role for tuakana including an enhanced sense of identity, wellbeing, and social connectedness.<br />Conclusions: Results demonstrated that kaumātua had a strong capacity to be peer educators and also the intervention had positive impacts on tuakana. The study contributes to research about culture-centered, strengths-based peer interventions with Indigenous elders that may help to reduce health inequities and poor aging experiences.<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Promoting childhood obesity control policies is a public health priority (Institute of Medicine, 2012). To gain policy support among the public, health communicators often compete with messages from commercial industries advocating against such policies (Scully et al., 2017). Past research found that inoculating people against claims within pro-industry messages can promote acceptance of pro-policy messages, specifically in the context of childhood obesity control (Niederdeppe et al., 2014; 2015), consistent with years of studies on inoculation and improving resistance to persuasion (Banas & Rains, 2010). The larger inoculation literature, however, has focused on inoculation toward any and all oppositional messages rather than strategies that identify the likely source of such opposition (termed “targeted inoculation”). Such targeted strategies may reveal alternative theoretical pathways through which inoculation effects may occur. In addition, few previous studies considered how including visual imagery might reinforce textual inoculation messages (see King et al., 2014). The present study tests whether visual imagery enhances the effectiveness of targeted inoculation strategies and explores mechanisms of targeted inoculation effects on key outcomes.\n","Abstract Body: Disordered eating (DE) is a problem in the female college-population, and while preventative interventions exist, there is a need to examine the effectiveness of writing prompts in modifying cognitions about body image and DE behaviors. In this study, participants were randomized to one of eight prompts, extracted from evidence-based prevention programs, and completed posttest measures to compare prompts on selected outcomes: Emotional response, clarity, ease, and interest. In the sample, 62.90% observed DE symptoms in their peers (e.g., frequent dieting, guilt related to food, and skipping meals regularly). Compared to prompts based on cognitive behavioral principles and cognitive dissonance, a prompt asking participants to imagine their life if they were not held back by current body image concerns was most effective in eliciting cognitive re-evaluation. Recommendations for future DE prevention programs include utilizing writing prompts as a means of eliciting emotions that lead to re-evaluation of potentially harmful beliefs.\n","Abstract Body: Mental illness has become increasingly prevalent among the college student population, and a substantial amount of research has been done to determine barriers to seeking professional care. Self-efficacy, response efficacy (i.e., perceived effectiveness of professional help), perceived severity of mental illness, and perceived susceptibility to mental illness have been discussed as potential barriers to help-seeking. Despite being discussed in the extended parallel process model (EPPM), these four components have not been examined together in research on help seeking for depression. This study explores how the interactivity of a website designed to address efficacy, severity, and susceptibility regarding depression influences college students attitudes towards seeking professional help for mental health concerns.\n","Abstract Body: Background. Cancer misinformation is a prominent topic in current academic and public discourse, yet the state of the research has not been synthesized. We examine how misinformation has been defined and studied across cancer-related issues, communication platforms, and sources, to identify gaps and opportunities for future research.<br />Methods. We conducted a scoping review of the 123 peer-reviewed manuscripts found across 5 databases from the first identified study in 1982 through December 31, 2018. Information about study design and sample, misinformation definition and operationalization, and cancer characteristics (e.g. cancer site, point along the cancer continuum) were extracted.<br />Results. While content analysis was the most common methodology(46.5%), studies with human subjects typically focused on the general population(71.6%) leaving vulnerable populations (e.g. high risk, racial/ethnic minorities) and stakeholders (e.g. patients, physicians) underrepresented. Only 31% of studies explicitly defined “misinformation,” and various combinations of person-(79%), context-(72%), and cultural-factors(12%) were used to operationalize “misinformation.” Cancer, generally, was the most common topic across studies(25.2%), followed by breast (21.3%) and cervical cancer(13.4%). Misinformation about cancer prevention was most common (72.4%), followed by treatment(44.1%), detection(39.4%), diagnosis(33.1%), survivorship (28.3%) and end-of-life/palliative care(7.1%).<br />Conclusions. Multiple gaps in the literature and unique aspects of misinformation in the context of cancer were identified. The lack of research around misinformation processing and long-term effects, and the variety of ways in which “misinformation” was defined and operationalized across cancer sites and points along the cancer control continuum indicate a strong need for strategic communication research to address this multifaceted and widespread issue.\n","Abstract Body: This study proposes a theory-driven framework with which we demonstrate that emotions mediate the relationship between presumed influences of attitude-incongruent vaccination-related information on others and individuals' intention to correct as well as regulate this information. This framework was built on the influence-of-presumed-influence model and cognitive appraisal theory. We tested the framework with web survey data of 660 adults in the United States which included both the supporters and opponents of vaccination. Results showed that supporters' perception that anti-vaccination misinformation had an influence on others (i.e., susceptibility) and their perception that such an influence had a serious consequence (i.e., severity) were both related to their subsequent emotional reactions, such as anger and anticipated guilt. These emotions, in turn, were associated with supporters' intentions to correct and regulate anti-vaccination misinformation. Similarly, opponents' perceptions that pro-vaccination information had an influence on others and their perceptions that this influence had a serious consequence were both associated with their subsequent anger and anticipated guilt, which further predicted opponents' intention to “correct” the pro-vaccination information (i.e., spreading anti-vaccination information) and to regulate this information on the internet and social media. The implication of the findings is discussed.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Background<\/i><br /><br />To combat the spread of vaccine misinformation on social media (Broniatowski et al., 2018), researchers have tested various correction strategies. Source credibility has been effective in correcting the influence of health misinformation on people’s beliefs, but few studies have tested its effect on attitudes (Walter & Murphy, 2018). Attitudes are a more influential factor than beliefs to predict health behaviors (Cappella, Maloney, Ophir, & Brennan, 2015); therefore, we integrate source credibility in fact-checking messages in correcting misinformation’s influence on attitude, and we argue that perceived source expertise plays an important role in determining the effectiveness of a fact-checking message (Vraga & Bode, 2017, 2018). In this study, we tackle the questions of which sources vaccine skeptics trust and why, and whether source credibility can lead to adjustments of vaccine attitude.<br /><br />McGuire (1978) has identified that both source credibility and message credibility change people’s attitude. Source credibility includes source expertise, the extent to which the source is capable of providing accurate information, and trustworthiness, the perception that the source is willing to provide information that is accurate (Pornpitakpan, 2004). Both source expertise and trustworthiness positively predict the message credibility of the fact-checking messages, which then positively influences attitudes (Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). Therefore, we hypothesize that (1) sources with higher expertise and higher trustworthiness will lead to greater message credibility, and (2) higher message credibility will predict more favorable attitudes toward vaccines.<br /><br /><i>Design<\/i><br /><br />We developed a large-scale online experiment using a nationally representative sample of 1,161 vaccine skeptics who believed that “the health risks of vaccines outweigh the benefits” to some extent. The study conducted a 5 (vaccine misinformation topic: <i>influenza, HPV, MMR, Tdap, or Zika<\/i>) by 13 (fact-checking message sources: algorithms, news media, medical institutions, universities, or fact-checking organizations) between-subjects factorial design, including five misinformation only control conditions. We examined changes in participants’ pre- to post-attitudes toward vaccine, as well as their perceived expertise and trustworthiness of the 13 sources and perceived credibility of the fact-checking messages.<br /><br /><i>Results<\/i><br /><br />Participants held more favorable post-attitudes toward vaccine in fact-checking conditions than control (<i>p<\/i><.01). However, post-attitudes became more negative in both fact-checking (<i>p<\/i><.05) and control (<i>p<\/i><.0001) compared to their prior-attitudes. Nevertheless, the attitude change in fact-checking was significantly smaller than control (<i>p<.05<\/i>) (Figure 1).<br /><br />For source credibility, perceived source expertise was significantly higher in fact-checking messages from universities and medical institutions than algorithms, news media, and fact-checking organizations (<i>F <\/i>[4, 625] = 14.98, <i>p <\/i>= .001). Perceived source trustworthiness did not differ among sources. Perceived message credibility was the highest in fact-checking messages from university sources (<i>F <\/i>[12, 1036] = 2.42, <i>p<\/i> =.004).<br /><br />To explain the mechanism of how source expertise and trustworthiness influenced attitudes via message credibility, we constructed a structural equation model. Since university sources were perceived as higher in expertise and message credibility, we compared universities to other sources separately in the model to explain its influence on attitude. As Figure 2 shows, sources from universities resulted in higher post-attitudes compared to sources from algorithm, media, and fact-checking organizations through higher source expertise and message credibility.<br /><br /><i>Discussion<\/i><br /><br />Our study is one of the first to systematically examine the credibility of various fact-checking sources on correcting vaccine misinformation. Our approach significantly reduced the negative effects of misinformation on attitudes when posts are labeled by credible sources. We find that across many types of sources, messages from universities are the most effective in reducing the negative impact of misinformation on attitudes toward vaccines through perceived source expertise and message credibility. Future research should investigate other credible sources and further explore the effects of corrections within the social media environment.\n","Abstract Body: Social media poses a threat to public health by facilitating the spread of misinformation, as exemplified by the anti-vaccine movement, naturopathic treatments, and rumors about the spread of infectious disease. At the same time, social media offers a promising avenue to correct misinformation—as evidenced by real-time corrections, crowdsourced fact-checking, and algorithmic tagging. Despite the prominence of misinformation on social media, there is still considerable ambiguity regarding its impact and the ability to counteract its influence.<br /><br />The current study synthesizes a decade (2009-2019) of empirical research to evaluate the relative impact of exposure to health misinformation on social media and its correction in regard to changes in knowledge, attitude, intention, and behavior (RQ1-RQ2). We performed random effects meta-analysis, subgroup analyses, and a meta-regression.<br /><br />The mean effect size of exposure to misinformation on social media was moderate (<i>d<\/i>=0.56, 95% CI [0.20, 0.92], <i>p<\/i>=.005), with significant heterogeneity across studies (<i>Q<\/i>(21)=204.63, <i>I<\/i><sup>2<\/sup>=86.05%, <i>p<\/i>=.0005). On the other hand, the relative effectiveness of correction attempts was much more modest (<i>d<\/i>=0.28, 95% CI [0.19, 0.36], <i>p<\/i>=.01). Based on these results, the study concludes that although a number of approaches to combat misinformation have been tested, current interventions have limited efficacy to debunk misinformation on social media.\n","Abstract Body: The use of online health information may play an especially important role in the care and treatment of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in places with fragmented service delivery models like China. However, the way credibility of that information is perceived, as it exists within diverse online environments, has not been sufficiently researched. This quantitative study investigates predictors of perceived information credibility of online ASD information. Analysis of a China-wide online survey (n=327) distributed to caregivers of people on the ASD spectrum suggests that argument quality, verification, contributor’s literacy competency and reference credibility are strong predicters of perceived information credibility, whereas crowd consensus is not. These findings contribute to research being done regarding perceived online health information credibility in diverse online environments, in the Chinese context, in places that do not have high levels of institutionalized information service provision, or is related to ASD.     <br />\n","Abstract Body: Analysis of youth self-reports from a field experiment (N=189 families) testing effects of a media literacy intervention confirmed main effects on Critical Thinking about Content, Talk about Nutrition Labels, and Vegetables Eaten Yesterday, with age-related effects on Child-Initiated Discussion, Critical Thinking about Sources and Fruit Eaten Yesterday. A multigroup structural model confirmed that child-initiated discussion mentored by the parent provided the catalyst for critical thinking and behavior change.\n","Abstract Body: This study explored how behavior decision beliefs factor (i.e., food sensation, eating restraint, and brand attachment) and emotional factor (i.e., emotional ambivalence) influence attitude and behavior relationship in the context of a health-related topic evaluation about fast food eating. These behavior decision belief factors were predicted to drive the cognitive and affective responses in the decision-making process that resulted in fast food eating. A longitudinal study with two waves of online surveys was conducted (N=458) to examine a proposed path model on the basis of the theory of plan behavior. Analysis through structural equation modeling indicated that these behavior decision beliefs factors predicted behavior (i.e., fast food eating in past 30 days) through cognitive factors indicated by TPB (i.e., attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intention) and via emotional response factor (i.e., emotional ambivalence). The emotional factors (i.e., emotional ambivalence) were found to have both directed and indirect influences on fast food eating intention. Brand attachment, eating restraint, and past eating habit had an indirect influence on fast food eating behavior through fast food eating intention. This study added knowledge of the influence of the behavioral decision beliefs factor to the extended TPB framework in the context of exposing to a health-related topic. The findings of the study put forward implications in health communication research and social marketing practices fighting against obesity.\n","Abstract Body: This study assesses the extent of child-oriented promotional features on cereals with varying levels of sugar. To evaluate the effectiveness of the US industry self-regulatory program, analyses compare cereals manufactured by companies that do and do not participate in the Children’s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative (CFBAI). A sample of 159 ready-to-eat cereals was collected from two stores and coded for sugar content and the presence of eight child-oriented features. Among cereals with low sugar per serving, 28% were classified as moderate-sugar per ounce, and 55% of moderate-sugar per serving cereals had high sugar per ounce. Games/activities and trade-characters were especially common, particularly on high-sugar per ounce cereals. Child-oriented features were rare on low-sugar cereals, and highest on cereals with higher sugar content per ounce and produced by CFBAI companies. Variable suggested serving sizes may contribute to parents’ misunderstanding and children’s higher sugar consumption. CFBAI-participating manufacturers apply advertising guidelines to packaging, yet heavily market high sugar cereals to children via packaging.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Objective: <\/i>This study assessed the effectiveness of an intervention designed using Potter’s (2004) Cognitive Model of Media Literacy – originally conceptualized for mass media messages – to increase the “food package” literacy (knowledge, skills related to judging the health qualities of food products) of participants.<br /><i>Methods:<\/i> A mixed-method quasi-experimental design was used to assess the effectiveness of the program.

A comparison of the intervention group post-test score (18.6) to the control group’s score (15.18) was also statistically significant (p<.0001). A comparison of the open-ended package analysis assessment showed differences from pre- to post-test as well as control vs. intervention group in terms of what package elements participants used to assess the healthfulness of the product<br /><i>Discussion:<\/i> Results suggest that a food package literacy intervention designed using a model of media literacy is feasible and effective in impacting knowledge and skills related to judgments about the healthfulness of packaged food products.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Educational Entertainment (EE) is a promising delivery method for Social and Emotional Learning interventions focused on mental illness stigma reduction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the changes in students’ self-reported empathy and mental illness stigma after participating in an EE intervention about coping with bipolar disorder delivered in a live-play format to elementary school students. Results from this within-subjects evaluation revealed no changes in empathy, but a small, statistically significant improvement in mental illness stigma. EE is a viable intervention for systematically improving SEL skills on a broader level.\n","Abstract Body: The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared tobacco smoking a global health epidemic, citing 8 million deaths and an economic cost of around 1.4 trillion USD per year. Under a UN mandate a global voluntary target was established in 2013 to reduce the prevalence of tobacco use, with varying success rates across the globe to date.<br />While there has been a gradual reduction in combustible cigarette smoking rates across the developed world (Drope et al., 2018), there has been a sharp increase in the popularity and usage of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) since their introduction in 2003 (Drope et al., 2018; McCausland, Maycock, Leaver, & Jancey, 2019).<br />The tobacco and vaping industries claim that e-cigarettes products are less harmful than traditional cigarettes as they are non-combustible, and produce an aerosol with fewer toxic elements like tar and carbon monoxide (Hajek, Etter, Benowitz, Eissenberg, & McRobbie, 2014; Simonavicius, McNeill, Shahab, & Brose, 2018). Indeed, as combustible cigarettes become less socially acceptable and demand decreases, the tobacco industry has increasingly positioned e-cigarettes as part of the solution to reach the WHO’s smoking reduction targets.<br />E-cigarette uptake in Australia remains comparatively low to that in other developed nations (Greenhalgh & Scollo, 2018). This is likely the result of current laws preventing the sale of e-cigarettes containing nicotine in all Australian states and territories due to nicotine’s classification as a schedule 7 ‘dangerous poison’ (Greenhalgh, Grace, & Scollo, 2019). However, given the success of targeted public health policies, such as the Australian Federal laws banning smoking in enclosed places, increased taxing of tobacco products and the introduction of the world’s first plain packaging laws in 2012 (Scollo & Greenhalgh,<br />2018), the tobacco industry’s lobbying efforts have shifted to establish e-cigarettes as a socially acceptable alternative.<br />Philip Morris International (PMI) controls the main share of the global tobacco market and is the second biggest tobacco company in Australia (Freeman, Winstanley, & Bayly, 2019). This study used framing theory to critically analyse corporate communication materials from PMI to identify the prevailing themes used to challenge Australia’s existing e-cigarette regulations and garner public support for broader access to nicotine containing e-cigarette products. The inclusion criteria for data collection were materials published between January 2018 and July 2019 relating to PMI’s e-cigarettes, heat-not-burn (HNB) products or ‘smokefree’ transformation. 1,534 items were identified for thematic analysis, covering posts across PMI’s social media accounts, media releases, news articles, reports, whitepapers, communication to public health professionals, as well as submissions to two government enquiries.<br />Seven themes and 19 sub-themes emerged from this data. Tobacco Harm Reduction emerged as the dominant theme from the thematic analysis, with references to harm reduction woven through most materials. Other key frames include; PMI as a good corporate citizen, advocating on behalf of smokers, lobbying governments, science and innovation, improved public health outcomes and justifying the presence of nicotine in their Reduced-Risk Products (RRPs).<br />The authors argue that the frame of science and innovation is crucial in understanding how PMI attempts to build trust among consumers; investors and shareholders; lobby government; and divide the public health sector. PMI use extensive research and development expenditure to add credibility to harm reduction claims of their RRPs and to consequently legitimise their claimed position of authority. Indeed, PMI appears to position themselves as the ‘white knight’ of society, campaigning to improve health outcomes, where the public health sector has apparently failed.<br />Given PMI’s status as a leading transnational tobacco corporation, study findings arguably inform the understanding of communication and strategic positioning strategies used by the global tobacco industry and hence may inform future public health campaigns.\n","Abstract Body: <br />Television history reveals a pattern of the top rated comedy shows incorporating health communication or prosocial messages in one or more of the show’s episodes. Although these highly rated comedy television series were seen by millions of viewers (IMDb, 2013), relatively few studies have examined the effects of embedding serious health messages in a humorous context.  This study examines entertainment-education within a humorous narrative context focusing on three main aims: (1) What effects does a humorous narrative entertainment-education episode have on viewers’ topic relevant prosocial self/collective-efficacy, attitudes, and behavioral intentions and viewers’ resistance to persuasion? (2) What effect does including a PSA that also features a celebrity/non-celebrity before/after the show have on the show’s prosocial effects? (3) How does the viewer’s perceptions of humor and parasocial interaction with the show’s characters impact the viewer’s resistance to persuasion and prosocial effects?  Results largely highlighted the importance of viewers’ perceptions of humor and parasocial interaction in reducing resistance to persuasion, but also revealed the potential for harmful effects on health-related self-efficacy, attitudes, and behavioral intentions when a health issue is portrayed in a humorous context.<br /> <br />Keywords: Entertainment-Education, Social Cognitive, Parasocial Interactions, Self-Efficacy, Humor, Sitcom, Experiment\n","Abstract Body: This paper analyzes the Dengvaxia case in the Philippines through the lens of Social Drama (Turner, 1969). Utilizing various concepts from medical anthropology and communication, the author aimed to present an alternative view of the highly biomedical discourses surrounding this current public health crisis. Through the concept of biomediatizaton, the reproduction of symbols through news media platforms was discussed. The author argued that communicative inequities greatly contributed to the crisis that resulted to schism as a huge divide between the health authorities and the masses gave rise to other public health issues. Lastly, the author presents symbols associated with biopower as seen from discourse typologies coproduced through the news media platforms.<br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>biomediatization, biopower, social drama, mass communication\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: (Truncated Abstract for Extended Abstract Submission) <br /><br />Medical mistrust, distrust in the motives of medical personnel and institutions, has been associated with decreased likelihood of engaging in several health and health-related behaviors. Despite calls for investigations into medical mistrust, little work has been done that explicitly examines medical mistrust as a phenomenon of interest. More specifically, there is a dearth of work examining the antecedents of medical mistrust. More specifically, the possible role of mediated communication has been neglected in medical mistrust scholarship. There has been some evidence of a relationship between mediated communication and medical mistrust. Based on social cognitive theory and priming, it was hypothesized that exposure to news stories with negative health care content or racial discrimination content would result in increased medical mistrust, and in turn, decreased willingness to engage in health behaviors. Additionally, it was posited that news stories with both types of content (i.e., health-related racial discrimination stories) would produce the highest levels of medical mistrust. The results revealed that negative health content and racial discrimination content significantly increased race-based medical mistrust but had no significant impact on general medical mistrust. Additionally, exposure to health-related racial discrimination stories resulted in higher levels of race-based medical mistrust than non-health, non-racial discrimination stories. Finally, only general medical mistrust was positively related to willingness to get a flu shot and willingness to encourage a family member to become an organ donor.\n","Abstract Body: Human papillomavirus (HPV), which 80% of sexually active individuals become infected with at a given time in their lives, causes various life-threatening diseases including cervical, anal, penile, vulvar, vaginal, and oropharyngeal cancers. Although HPV vaccination has been commended as the best protection against HPV infections, the vaccine remains underutilized. Much of prior research endeavored to examine effective strategies to promote the vaccine and a few systematic reviews also attempted to synthesize technology use and intervention characteristics and effects in this regard. However, no study to date has examined theory use in HPV vaccination promotion, despite the fact that theoretical guidance is especially important in facilitating behavior change. With a sample of 70 peer-reviewed studies, the current systematic review mainly synthesizes theory use in prior empirical research and the effectiveness of theory-guided messages or interventions on HPV vaccination-related attitude, intention, and behavior.\n","Abstract Body: The surge of misinformation on social media poses a disturbing threat to global public health. Building on the theories of credibility evaluation, this qualitative study discusses how users process health misinformation from the dominant strong-tie social media network, WeChat, in China. We conducted six on-site focus groups involving 48 adult participants discussing their thoughts and behaviors toward processing health misinformation on social media. Qualitative analyses resulted in three categories of heuristic factors (i.e., interface cues, information sources, intermediaries, linguistic features) and two personal factors (i.e., personal experiences and motivated reasoning) that influence the credibility judgement of information. In light of the findings, we argue intermediaries can play an essential role in online credibility judgement in strong-tie social networks. In addition, the findings reveal misinformation sharing brings generational conflict between parents and children, suggesting interesting relational implications of online misinformation diffusion.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This research aimed to find influential factors of determining individuals’ use and non-use of diet and fitness apps on smartphones. For this research purpose, this research paid attention to diverse groups of predictor that would significantly affect people’s use and non-use of diet and fitness apps on smartphones. In total, 105 factors were considered as potential predictors and included into the further analyses using a machine learning algorithm, XGBoost. The main reason of selecting this particular algorithm was that it had been known as one of the most accurate and popular algorithms of predicting consumer behaviors. The results indicate that the accuracy score of those factors for predicting people’s use and non-use of diet and fitness apps was approximately 71.3%. Particularly, the most influential predictors were mainly related to social influence, media use, overeating orientations, social support, health management, and attitudes toward exercise. These findings contribute to helping scholars and practitioners to develop more practical strategies of the implementation of diet and fitness apps.   <br />\n","Abstract Body: This study investigated the effect of different framing, visual, and cultural appeal strategies, embedded in a depression-campaign post on Facebook, on Chinese immigrants’ cognitive and affective responses to the post and their intention to provide help and support for individuals who suffer from depression. A 2 (framing: gain vs. loss) x 2 (visuals: a photograph of real people vs. a cartoon graphic) x 2 (cultural appeal: with long-term reward vs. without long-term reward) between-subjects online experiment with conducted using a representative sample of 304 Chinese immigrants in the United States. Results show: 1) using a photo of real people directly contributed to participants’ increased intention to provide support and their self-efficacy in identifying depression among themselves; 2) using a photo of real people without long-term cultural appeal led to higher loving emotional responses; 3) loving emotion and self-efficacy in identifying depression among themselves were sequential mediators for the effect of using a photo of real people without long-term reward on intention to provide support. This study provides insights into advancing health communication research by integrating cultural psychology theory in health promotion among immigrants and offer strategic recommendations for designing effective depression help-support campaigns on social media.\n","Abstract Body: Grounded in the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), Fuzzy-Trace Theory, and Construal Level Theory, an online experiment was conducted to examine how temporal distance framing (near- or distant-future framing) and risk presentation style (gist- or verbatim-based risk presentation) used in health messages about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) can affect young adults’ perceptions of STDs and their intentions to get tested for STDs. Results show that (a) exposure to the health message resulted in higher perceived severity of STDs among those who reported low preexposure perceived severity, while exposure to the message led to lower perceived susceptibility to STDs among members who reported high preexposure perceived susceptibility, (b) for most participants, exposure to a gist-based message resulted in higher perceived susceptibility to STDs and stronger intentions to get tested, and (c) perceived susceptibility and attitude were found to be the strongest predictors of behavioral intentions.\n","Abstract Body: A growing number of American colleges and universities became vape-free campuses in response to the e-cigarette prevalence among young adults. However, little is known about communication/psychological factors associated with a vape-free policy support among campus members. The present study explores the interaction effects of affirmation and framing of messages promoting a vape-free campus policy on college students’ support for the policy. A computer-based experiment with a two (affirmation: self vs. group) by two (message framing: gain vs. loss) by two (vaping status: vapers vs. non-vapers) between-subjects design was conducted. Our analysis indicates that vapers express a greater level of policy support when they were self-affirmed and exposed to a gain-framed massage than other vapers who were group-affirmed, regardless of the message framing condition. Additionally, non-vapers’ level of vape-free campus policy support increased when they were self-affirmed and exposed to a loss-framed message.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examined two framing approaches with the potential to mitigate psychological reactance in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. A randomized experiment was conducted with a 2 (gain frame vs. loss frame) x 2 (individual frame vs. societal frame) between-subjects design with 316 female Singaporeans. Results show that a loss-frame (vs. gain-frame) prompts greater perceived freedom threat and psychological reactance, which are serially mediated to lower HPV vaccination intention. We also found a significant interaction between individual-societal framing and psychological reactance on vaccination intention: the counterproductive effect of a loss-frame (vs. gain-frame) was serially mediated to vaccination intent only when it addressed individual outcomes but not when it focused on societal outcomes. This study theoretically contributes to the literature on reactance by addressing its moderators and offers practical insights in communicating vaccination.\n","Abstract Body: One of the greatest challenges in health communication is to persuade people to enact healthy behavior, whose consequences of (not) following that recommendation may lie in distant future and thus be considered as less valuable or important. Extending previous research on message framing and episodic future thinking (EFT), this study examines how to improve the persuasiveness of a message that promotes HPV vaccination by increasing the extent to which one anticipates the regret of not taking the vaccine. Results revealed that loss-framed message (vs. gain-framed message) and thinking about the future prior to seeing the message (vs. past-thinking vs. no-thinking) produced greater anticipated regret, which in turn, led to more positive attitudes and stronger intentions. Also, interaction effects were observed such that EFT created a favorable condition to enhance the effectiveness of <i>gain<\/i>-framed message. Findings support the viability of such future-oriented emotion in improving the persuasiveness of long-term health messages.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines how the framing of messages and interactivity influence individuals’ intentions to detect depression. An experiment with a 2 (message framing: gain- versus loss- ) x 2 (interactivity: low versus high) between-subject design was conducted among 269 Chinese participants (M = 30.70, SD = 7.34). The results showed that those reading loss-framed messages had a higher intention to take a depression examination compared to those reading gain-framed messages. Secondly, those reading messages delivered with high interactivity had a higher intention compared to those reading messages delivered with low interactivity. Further, the interaction effect of framed messages and their interactivity was found to influence individuals’ intentions to take a depression test as well. Specifically, participants who read the loss-framed message reported stronger intention in the high interactivity group, whereas the loss-framed message was more effective on the intention of an individual to take a depression examination delivered through high interactivity.\n","Abstract Body: Overview<br /><br />Increasingly, state lawmakers are requiring public high schools to teach students about sex trafficking as part of health education (Drummond, 2017; Leins, 2019; Poindexter, 2019). However, academic literature provides scant guidance on teaching adolescents about sex trafficking. To inform curriculum development, we surveyed 264 adolescents about their preexisting knowledge and attitudes about sex trafficking. Participants were between 14 and 18 years old, living in the Southeastern US. We also randomly assigned participants to view one of four educational messages about sex trafficking and assessed their responses to these messages. Each message is publicly available online, was produced by an anti-trafficking advocacy organization, and featured a narrative about an individual survivor of trafficking.<br /><br />Existing research finds that individual narratives about victims/survivors of human trafficking, as opposed to a thematic framing of the issue of trafficking, heightens consumers’ victim-blaming responses (Johnston & Friedman, 2019; Johnston, Friedman, & Sobel, 2015). Therefore, we measured participants’ victim-blaming responses after viewing the educational message.<br /><br />Participants’ emotional responses to the messages were also part of this study. According to the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), messages that elicit strong emotions like fear or anxiety may thwart health practitioners’ intentions if viewers feel helpless regarding the issue (So, 2013; Witte et al., 1996). Furthermore, adolescents’ still-developing emotion regulation processes could heighten their emotions while consuming upsetting messages (Somerville, Jones, & Casey, 20019). Therefore, we measured participants’ emotional responses to the messages.<br />Preliminary results are presented below.<br /><br />Pre-existing knowledge and attitudes<br /><br />60% of the participants reported feeling somewhat or very familiar with the issue of sex trafficking, and 65% of participants said that they understood the issues surrounding sex trafficking somewhat or very well. In spite of their perceived awareness about sex trafficking, just 31% of participants reported that sex trafficking is a problem in their community. Therefore, education efforts should emphasize the prevalence of sex trafficking in all communities.<br /><br />News media (79%) and school (62%) were the two most-popular information sources about sex trafficking, followed by friends and family (41%) and entertainment media (33%). Since scholarship has documented problematic portrayals of sex trafficking in news and entertainment media (Johnston, Friedman, & Shafer, 2014; Small, 2012), educators should consider including a media literacy component in sex-trafficking prevention curriculum.<br /><br />Victim-blaming responses<br /><br />Asked “Do you think that what happened to the trafficked person in the video/story was partially caused by his/her own behavior?,” 41% of respondents answered yes. Asked, “Do you think that the trafficked person in the story could have prevented this from happening?,” 67% answered yes. This discrepancy calls for additional research to understand how wording bias may impact measures of victim-blaming.<br /><br />Emotional Responses<br /><br />Overall, the participants reported middle-ground emotional responses to the videos. On a 5-point Likert scale, the participants reported a mean score of 2.53 for feeling afraid, 2.47 for feeling anxious, and 3.73 for feeling sad. However, not all reported such manageable emotional responses. 14% of respondents reported a 5 for feeling afraid and 12.5% reported a 5 for feeling anxious. These findings comport with existing research about adolescent emotion regulation—while most adolescents are capable of managing their emotions, a minority struggle with emotion regulation (Compas et al., 2017; Somerville, Jones, & Casey, 2009). Thus, a portion of students may find these videos too upsetting.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Preliminary study results provide valuable information to educators developing sex trafficking prevention curriculum for adolescents. Curriculum should highlight the prevalence of trafficking across communities and include a media literacy component. Additionally, the use of narratives focused on trafficked individuals may be emotionally overwhelming for some students. More research is needed to understand adolescents’ victim-blaming responses to these narratives.\n","Abstract Body: We used two studies with adolescents and young adults in Washington state, a state that legalized recreational marijuana use for adults 21 and older in 2012, to examine the relationship between social media use, exposure to promarijuana content, sex-related marijuana expectancies, and intentions to use and use of marijuana. We found differences in the processes of such effects based on gender and age, highlighting the complex relationships among key variables. Results and implications are discussed. <br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Introduction<br /><br />Trust and perceived value are understudied, yet promising, motivational factors in the context of young adult decision-making about private health insurance (PHI), which can enable access to health care and support positive health outcomes. The Australian health care system relies on PHI as a contribution to a mixed model of public and private funding (Sowa, Kault, Byrnes, Ng, Comans & Scuffham, 2018), positioning it as a structural condition that can influence individual health choices. However, PHI membership, which can cost young adults around AUD$1,000 per year, has declined significantly (Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, 2019), straining its sustainability (Robinson, 2019), and affecting the health system and, potentially, individual health outcomes.<br /><br />This study responds to scarce research on PHI and Kim, Park, Yoo and Shen's (2010) call for research to explore the health communication imperative when structural factors are introduced into research problems. We begin to achieve this task by examining how trust and perceived value operate alongside more traditional motivational (e.g., problem, involvement and constraint recognition from Kim and Grunig, 2011), and individual factors in the context of a structural condition of PHI. Further, from a message perspective, communication often focuses on incentives to join PHI programs, neglecting communication opportunities to reduce attrition. As a result of these combined factors, two research questions guide this study:<br /><br />RQ1: What factors motivate young adult non-PHI holders to join programs?<br />RQ2: What factors motivate young adults who hold PHI to cancel it?<br /><br />Methodology<br /><br />An online questionnaire comprising motivational questions was completed by 594 young adults aged 18 to 30 years in April 2018. The survey was divided into two samples recognising PHI status: i) 293 young adult participants with PHI and ii) 301 young adult participants without PHI.<br /><br />Results<br /><br />T-test results (Table 1) between the two samples showed significant differences in individual factors like health consciousness, problem, involvement and constraint recognition, referent criterion, attitude, trust and perceived value.<br />Structural equation modelling explored the paths that motivated those with PHI to cancel and those without to join. Participants with PHI (Figure 1) with high problem and involvement recognition, trust and perceived value are likely to have positive PHI attitude and are less likely to cancel. However, referent criterion (i.e., prior experiences of health-related problems that could be solved using PHI) increases participants’ intention to cancel. Participants without PHI (Figure 2) with high problem and involvement recognition, trust and perceived<br />value are likely to have positive PHI attitude and thus, intention to join. Contrary to the findings of the group with PHI, referent criterion increased their intention to join.<br /><br />Discussion<br /><br />This study identified several motivational factors for joining and cancelling PHI. Interestingly, referent criterion increases the likelihood of both cancelling and joining PHI in respective samples, reflecting the complexity of prior experiences. However, even if motivational factors are present, trust for insurance companies and perceived value can also affect their behavioral intentions. This study found that individual characteristics (such as health consciousness) led to different motivations to solve potential health-related problems by purchasing PHI. Thus, identifying a means by which communication to counter or support motivational factors can align with structural conditions in health. Ultimately, this research aims to better support young adult PHI decisions and health outcomes in Australia.\n","Abstract Body: MeToo Movement unveiled the high prevalence of sexual assault in Chinese colleges. To create a safer environment, many Chinese universities require students to engage in bystander intervention sessions, which encourages students to assess, identify, and interrupt the harmful situation. Drawing upon health belief model and theory of planned behavior, this study tests the effects of bystander intervention programs, exposure to news reports on MeToo Movement, and institutional responses to sexual violence events on bystander intervention intention and behaviors. The results of an online survey (<i>N<\/i>=814) indicated that bystander intervention programs were effective in changing attendees’ perceived benefits, subjective norms, and bystander self-efficacy, which, in turn, led to increased bystander intervention intention and actual behaviors. Moreover, exposure to MeToo Movement reports and institutional responses to sexual assault events were significant predictors of bystander intervention intention and behaviors via the mediation of perceived benefits, perceived costs, and subjective norms. The results provide valuable implications for developing effective bystander intervention programs in Chinese college communities. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Today, parents have unlimited access to information on parenting through digital media. Unfortunately, in the past, digital media has also been linked with various mental health difficulties such as anxiety, stress, and depression. This study examines the frequency of parental digital media use and whether it relates to parental mental health (shame, depression, stress) and parents’ subsequent perceptions about their ability to parent (efficacy and competence). Participants included 484 mothers and 345 fathers of infant children. Both mothers and fathers reported similar average levels of all variables, with the exception of shame, for which fathers reported more shame than mothers. We then tested a structural equation model of digital media use predicting mental health outcomes, which predicted parental perceptions of efficacy and competence. Both mothers’ and fathers’ digital media use was associated with heightened depression and stress; however, these mental health symptoms manifested differently between mothers’ and fathers’ perceptions of parental outcomes. Only for fathers did a mental health outcome mediate the relationship between media use and perceived ability to parent. Thus, those fathers that used more digital media were more likely to feel stressed, which was then associated with a lower perceived ability to perform well as a parent. The implications for fathers are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Celebrities’ self-disclosures about their personal mental health issues can enhance public awareness of mental illness such as depression. As live streaming becomes a popular choice for media consumption, microcelebrities such as video streamers may have similar potential influence over their audience. Using an online survey (<i>N = 474<\/i>), this study examined how exposure to streamers’ depression disclosures affected the viewer’s perceptions toward the streamer and depression. We also examined how parasocial relationships, parasocial interactions, and identification with streamers are associated with viewers’ perceived authenticity and credibility towards the streamers, as well as increase the viewers’ risk perceptions about mental health, including perceived prevalence, risk susceptibility, and risk severity. The study demonstrates a strong association between streamer’s health disclosure and public awareness regarding depression. The results examine the influence of microcelebrities in a new media context that advances theoretical understanding of masspersonal influence and extends previous studies around celebrity influencers as a promising opportunity for reducing social stigma around mental health discussions.        <br />\n","Abstract Body: There is a theorized link between the disclosure of a concealable stigma such as mental illness and enhanced psychological well-being, but research on this link tends to be weak and sometimes non-significant, pointing to the importance of examining potential moderators. Selfimage goals are goals that construct and defend a desired image of the self (Crocker & Canevello, 2012) and may be a moderator that can affect the benefits of disclosure. This study examined whether self-image goals moderate the association between mental illness disclosure and self-esteem. One hundred and seventy-four undergraduate students (age M = 22.15) who self-identified as having been diagnosed with mental illness participated in an online survey. As expected, results from hierarchical regression analyses showed that the positive association between mental illness disclosure and self-esteem was attenuated by self-image goals. The positive association between disclosure and self-esteem was observed only when participants reported low self-image goals. However, when they reported moderate or high levels of selfimage goals, this association become no longer significant. This research points to the importance of examining potential moderators to further advance theoretical understandings of when mental illness disclosure is beneficial and when it not.\n","Abstract Body: Language use plays an important role in revealing depressive symptoms. Previous studies have, however, predominantly focused on the cross-sectional associations between language use and depressive symptoms based on experimental designs. This study investigates how pre-existing depressive symptom levels predict personal language use, which in turn, predicts the future levels of depressive symptoms, as they act upon each other in a cyclical relationship. Given that depressive symptoms are prevalent among older adults, this study focuses on people aged 65 years and older. A total of 147 older adults participated in an online social support website, where they communicated via an online peer-to-peer forum over the course of a year. We extracted patterns of language use on the forum within the first six months using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), a dictionary-based text analysis program. Participants also reported their depressive symptoms via a survey at baseline and 12 months. A structural equation model was adopted to predict two consequential causal relationships simultaneously. Results show that depressive symptoms at baseline predict self-focus singular pronoun use, which in turn, predicts depressive symptoms at 12-month. We also found that greater use of words referring to family and friends is protective against depressive symptoms at 12-month. In addition, those with severer depressive symptoms at baseline are more likely to use insightful words. Our findings are in line with theories that highlight the roles of language use as an antecedent or an outcome of the course of depressive symptoms. Moreover, our findings extend previous work by adopting an unobtrusive approach that captures naturally occurring differences in language use in relation to depressive symptoms.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Informed by Communication Infrastructure Theory (CIT; Kim & Ball-Rokeach, 2006; Wilkin, Moran, Ball-Rokeach, Gonzalez, & Kim, 2010), this paper argues that organizations are communicative resources for promoting migrant health. Using key informant interviews with broadcast media professionals, journalists, non-government, and faith-based organization leaders, it explored how community organizations and ethnic media in Hong Kong constitute storytelling networks as health resources for Filipina household service workers. Aside from identifying cancer, stroke, and depression as shared concerns among Filipina household service workers, community organizations and ethnic media explained these concerns based on (1) work and labor conditions in Hong Kong and (2) obligations to left-behind families. As communicative resources, they provided health information, offered tangible support, and campaigned to employers and governments. In discussing social media for health, community organizations highlighted accessibility, whereas ethnic media focused on journalistic practices. Implications to CIT and applications to health campaigns and health reporting are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: <br />The built environment loosely refers to the physical aspects of our environment that are constructed and/or designed by people. Research indicates that differences in built environment features (e.g., presence/quality of sidewalks and green spaces versus large factories and freeways) contribute to health disparities. Health communication interventions designed to promote health behaviors should consider the ways that built environment features may impact campaign effectiveness. Based in communication infrastructure theory (CIT), this study explores the relationships between perceived built environment factors, individual’s connections to neighborhood storytellers, and level of physical activity. A survey of 398 randomly selected households in historically African American, lower income neighborhoods was conducted. Findings indicate that several built environment factors are associated with more integration into the storytelling network, which has a positive association with amount of exercise. However, access to health and wellness programs is the only feature of the built environment that predicts amount of exercise in the neighborhoods sampled.\n","Abstract Body: Purpose: Chinese Americans with diabetes often struggle following standard diabetes diets that focus on food measurement/restriction and many use Chinese medical principles to eat. We developed and tested the feasibility of a theoretically-informed nutritional counseling program (INC) that combines Chinese medicine principles with biomedical nutrition standards.<br />Methods: Participants were randomized into diabetes self-management education (DSME) group classes with either usual nutrition curriculum (control) or INC (intervention). Intervention participants met with a licensed acupuncturist to obtain a Chinese medicine diagnosis and received INC in a group setting, including a guidebook with recommendations based on Chinese medicine diagnosis. Time- and attention-matched control participants were interviewed by a research assistant about their diabetes and received American Diabetes Association nutrition recommendations from a diabetes educator. Data were collected at baseline, after the DSME class on nutrition, and at a 6-month follow-up. Pre- vs. post-intervention measures included dietary self-efficacy, diabetes distress, diet satisfaction, dietary adherence, weight and glycemic control.<br />Results: Participants were 18 Cantonese-speaking patients with diabetes (88% female, 94% income less than $30,000, average age = 61.8) with low acculturation but slight preference for western medicine over Chinese medicine. INC performed equally to usual care DSME with 100% of participants reporting the INC booklet helped their learning. Intervention participants showed similar results versus usual care.<br />Conclusion: Integrative nutritional counseling is feasible to implement as part of diabetes self-management education classes and shows promise as a culturally-sensitive alternative to usual care diabetes nutrition education for Chinese American patients.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Underpinned by the notion that community voices should be central to the development of localized communication infrastructures for health and wellbeing, this study applied Dutta’s (2008, 2011, 2018) culture-centered approach to examine meanings of health and the navigation of being healthy among 118 people residing in low-income suburban areas in Aotearoa New Zealand.  The culture-centered approach is based on dialogue between researchers and community members, and it centralizes local contexts by building theories from within the culture and co-creating dialogic spaces of listening, formed at the intersection of structure, culture, and agency.  In this study, participants constructed health in relation to food, housing, and healthcare, underpinned by financial inaccessibility and a deep-rooted cultural conflict between the collectivist norms practiced by the community and the neoliberal individualized structure.  The study illuminates how the pathologization of culture by structure constitutes poor health outcomes and how agentic expressions of culture negotiate local structures to regain health and wellbeing through acts of resistance.\n","Abstract Body: Female adolescents and young women increasingly turn to Instagram to connect with peers and follow media influencers. The image-based social media platform focuses on the representation of body images, which are mostly presented in an idealized form. This has fueled concerns about the potential negative impact of Instagram use on women’s body image. The present study tested a mediation model linking Instagram use to body dissatisfaction, partially mediated by upward social comparison with peers and media influencers and subsequent social appearance anxiety. Based on self-report cross-sectional data from 300 adolescent girls and young women with an average age of 20.5, the results show that the relationship between Instagram use (i.e., weekly use and commenting other people’s looks) was fully mediated by upward appearance comparison with media influencers, not peers, and subsequent social appearance anxiety. These findings highlight the detrimental effect of current posting practices by media influencers and the need to counteract this effect by improving women’s self-esteem and promoting a healthy body image.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined what and how characteristics of online health forum posts influence users’ liking behavior and therefore their perceived credibility to the posts. Under the guidance of De Graaf, Sanders, and Hoeken’s (2016) the health narrative framework, a computerized content analysis was conducted on a popular and representative online health forum, <i>Patient<\/i>. Descriptive and inferential statistic results show a positive bias of the forum posts, but the preference in positive words did not elicit more liking behaviors from readers, and the first-person perspective may make a post less likable and therefore perceived less credible. The theoretical and pragmatic implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Through two experiments, this study assessed source and message effects of Instagram-based pro-veganism messages. Experiment 1 (<i>N <\/i>= 294) examined effects of organization (brand versus non-profit) and message types (egoistic versus altruistic), while experiment 2 (<i>N <\/i>= 288) examined effects of source type (celebrity versus non-celebrity) and message valence (positive versus negative). Results demonstrated significant main effects of organization type, with consumers indicating more positive attitudes and higher credibility towards the brand. Significant main effects of message type were also found, with altruistic messages eliciting higher perceived information value than egoistic messages. Subjective norms had moderating effects on attitude towards the organization, while attitude towards veganism had moderating effects on perceived information value. Results also indicated significant main effects of message valence on perceived information value, and significant interaction effects of the two manipulated factors on intention to spread electronic word-of-mouth. Implications for future research and practical applications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among adolescents; Instagram is one of the most popular and fastest-growing social media platforms among them. A previous study presented preliminary evidence for suicide-related “subliminal messages” on Instagram, defined as very brief presentations of suicide-related content in video posts that users have no conscious awareness of. A systematic quantitative study was pending. We conducted a quantitative content analysis of Instagram video posts. A frame-by-frame coding procedure allowed for an assessment of whether suicide-related content was depicted in very brief segments, even when this content could not be consciously recognized when watched at regular speed. Analysis indicates that a substantial amount of suicide-related content is presented in very brief shots. However, only a small percentage (2%) of these videos presented suicide-related subliminal messages, as defined in the present study. The subjective threshold of conscious awareness differs inter-individually, complicating the operationalization. Although rare, subliminal messages are ethically highly problematic. There is a need for greater awareness of this subject.\n","Abstract Body: Drawing on interdisciplinary insights from terror management theory (TMT), this study examined how death defense mechanism (worldview value) reduces fear of death caused by organ donation and changes people’s perceptions and behavioral intentions of organ donation. Two experiments were conducted to examine the effect of worldview value in an organ donation campaign. Study 1 used a 2 (worldview: enhanced worldview vs. non-enhanced worldview) X 2 (mortality salient condition vs. control) experimental design (N=487). Results of Study 1 showed that increased worldview value can help people cope with the fear of death caused by organ donation and promote people’s intention of promoting organ donation related information. Study 2 used a 3 (emotional appeal: similar sympathy vs. dissimilar sympathy vs. less-similar sympathy) X 2 (defense mechanisms: worldview value vs. nonworldview value) experimental design (N=692). Results of Study 2 showed that a combination of worldview value and sympathy appeal message made people more altruistic toward a larger population. Theoretical and practical implications were also discussed in this paper.\n","Abstract Body: In recent years, the role of media in individuals’ alcohol consumption has been touched upon by several researchers. Nevertheless, the underlying processes explaining the relationship between media use and alcohol consumption, as well as the differences in strength of the associations between social and traditional media use and alcohol consumption remain understudied. The present cross-sectional study (N =  382) among emerging adults (M = 21.83, SD = 2.04, 75.1% females, 67.8% college students) examined drinking identity and drinking motives as underlying mechanisms of the relationship between alcohol-related media use and alcohol consumption, while comparing the role of social and traditional media in these processes. First, we found no associations between traditional media use and drinking identity, drinking motives or alcohol consumption. In contrast, social media use was both directly and indirectly related to alcohol consumption via drinking identity and drinking motives. This demonstrates that social media can play a socializing role in emerging adults’ alcohol consumption.\n","Abstract Body: Illicit use of prescription stimulants by young adults is a burgeoning health concern (Kroutil et al., 2006), with approximately 9% reporting lifetime misuse (Schepis, Teter, & McCabe, 2018). Prescription stimulant misuse (PSM) poses risks of addiction, co-use with alcohol and illicit drugs, and overdose (Arria, Caldeira, Vincent, O’Grady, & Wish, 2008; Cairns, Daniels, Wood, & Brett, 2016; Wu, Pilowsky, Schlenger, & Galvin, 2007). Much of the attention on PSM has focused on college contexts (Norman & Ford, 2018), but recent studies indicate PSM is also a concern for non-college attending or low socioeconomic status, homeless young adults (e.g., Barman-Adhikari et al., 2019; Schepis et al., 2018). This poses challenges for message development in health campaigns for these emerging vulnerable populations. The present investigation reports results of an elicitation study examining perceptions of advantages and disadvantages of PSM among a national sample of young adults (both college and non-college attending) to provide a more robust understanding of beliefs underlying the behavior.\n","Abstract Body: We examine purpose in life, or the degree to which people consider their life to be meaningful and has clear goals and directions, as an individual difference variable that may buffer susceptibility to peer influence on alcohol-related outcomes in college students. Previous work showed that individuals with a higher vs. lower sense of purpose tended to be more interconnected, suggesting that they might be more central in social networks. While having close social relationships and being central in a social network may have benefits, it can also put individuals at risk for increased opportunities for drinking, and indeed in past research, higher betweenness centrality has been associated with more drinking. Yet, higher purpose is associated with fewer alcohol-related problems among college students. We propose that purpose may buffer peer influence on alcohol-related outcomes without sacrificing the benefits of having close social ties. 54 college students self-reported their level of purpose in life and completed an ego network survey where they nominated close family and friends members and their relationships, from which betweenness centrality scores were calculated. Throughout the following 28 days, participants responded to daily text messages prompting them to indicate the daily frequency of encountering alcohol and current levels of alcohol craving. We found that individuals with higher vs. lower purpose were more central in their social networks (i.e., higher betweenness centrality) and encountered alcohol more frequently. However, those with higher purpose were less likely to crave alcohol, compared to their peers with lower purpose. These results suggest that the link between social network characteristics and alcohol-related outcomes might be influenced by individuals’ sense of purpose.\n","Abstract Body: The proliferation of social media and their pervasive use among adolescents and young adults (Anderson & Jiang, 2018) have not only revolutionized human communication, but have also magnified social and peer influence in regard to social, political, and health-related issues. One area of influence is the relationship between social media use and alcohol consumption. That is, numerous studies across multiple disciplines (Boyle, LaBrie, Froidevauw, & Witkovic, 2016; Geusens & Beullens, 2016; Moreno, Young, & Haaland, 2015) have shown that young users are very likely to be influenced by user-generated and promotional alcohol content on social media. The current SLR, guided by the Cochrane method (Moseley, Elkins, Herbert, Maher, Sherrington, 2019), provides a comprehensive review of social media and alcohol use studies between 2009 and 2019. It extends the scope of other reviews to include both peer-to-peer communication and alcohol-related advertising and marketing. Using the PRISMA guidelines for SLR and meta-analyses, this SLR examines the prevalence and nature of the relationship between social media use and alcohol consumption across a wide array of methodologies and disciplines. More specifically, our analysis strives to identify the major methodological approaches used in this field of research, the nature of relationships examined in relation to this topic, and the major conclusions from the literature. Based on this analyses we aim to offer directions for future research on this topic.\n","Abstract Body: The study was designed to develop an effective health communication strategy to guide decision-making as a means of increasing clinical trial participation. Built on exemplification theory and perceived similarity, the study used an online experiment with a 2 (source credentials: peer vs. expert) x 2 (source race: white vs. black) x 5 (message repetition) within-subject design. A total of 300 participants completed the experiment. Overall findings showed that clinical trial recruitment messages when employing peer as a message source, compared to expert (e.g., medical doctor), led to higher message and topic relevance, higher message credibility, more favorable attitudes toward clinical trials, and higher intentions to participate in future clinical. In addition, source race was interacted with source credentials and had influences on message relevance and topic relevance. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: clinical trials, exemplification, perceived expertise, perceived similarity\n","Abstract Body: Latina women experience higher rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in the United States. Papanicolaou (Pap) tests are essential for early detection and treatment of cervical cancer; however, Latinas exhibit low rates of adherence and follow up. We investigated the effect of anticipated fear on Pap test intentions. Additionally, we explored the mediating effect of self- and response- efficacy and moderating effect of descriptive and injunctive norms on this relationship. Our sample consisted of 1,543 Latina women residing in Los Angeles County. Hypotheses were tested with PROCESS, an OLS regression model that estimates direct, mediated, and moderated effects. Anticipated fear had a significant negative effect on Pap test intentions, which was mediated by self-efficacy. This mediated effect through self-efficacy was moderated by descriptive social norms. The results of this study have implications on the design of health communication campaigns and interventions targeting cervical cancer screening uptake in Latina women.\n","Abstract Body: The teen pregnancy rate in the United States is among the highest out of all western countries; yet, Black and Hispanic teens are disproportionately burdened by unintended pregnancies.In an effort to rectify these disparities and informed by theories of entertainment-education, a video entitled Plan Awas developed and tested among Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic White women aged 16 to 19 (N= 242).Results indicated that exposure to Plan Asignificantly improved attitudes towardLong-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs) but not intentions to use them.Notably, not all racial/ethnic groups benefited equally from the narrative, with the target population (Black and Hispanic women) benefiting the most and White women demonstrating no improvement compared to the control condition. These findings are partially explained by the tendency of Black participants to identify with the Black lead character and the Hispanic participants’tendency to identify with the Hispanic lead character. Overall, the study provides evidence for the ability of culturally-tailored narratives to ‘equalize the playing field’ in terms of contraceptive health.\n",null,"Abstract Body: <br />This study investigates how exposures to contradictory messages about HPV vaccine affect South Korean college women’s decision-making process about vaccination by focusing on several theoretical frameworks and concepts addressed in previous literature in health and risk communication. In particular, this study explores hypothesized relationships between contradictory messages exposure, information insufficiency, decisional conflicts about vaccination, and behavioral intentions to vaccinate. For analysis, a percentile bootstrap method and pairwise comparison tests in structural equation modeling (SEM) were employed. Exposure to contradictory vaccine messages significantly negatively affected current knowledge about HPV vaccine, and significantly positively influenced desired threshold about vaccine information. While current knowledge significantly and negatively affected vaccine confusion, information insufficiency failed to predict it. Vaccine confusion significantly positively affected decisional conflicts that significantly and negatively predicted behavioral intentions. Additionally, results show participants’ altruistic orientations and vaccine awareness moderate the associations among variables. Findings suggest theoretical and practical implications for future research investigating the effects of vaccine-related (mis)information on individuals’ decision-making about vaccination, particularly in the context of cultures where HPV vaccine awareness and uptake rates are low.\n","Abstract Body: Despite the availability of free pap testing services, Jamaican women have very low human papillomavirus (HPV) screening rates; 16% of women in the Kingston Metropolitan Area have been screened within the prior 3 years (Bruni et al., 2017). This paper discusses the testing of theory-based messages to increase HPV screening uptake in a low resource setting, using HPV self-test kits designed for this intervention. A total of 163 Jamaican women, aged 30–65 years, who had not had a pap test in at least 3 years, from two low socioeconomic status communities in Kingston, were enrolled and assigned to one of two versions of an HPV self-test kit, either with or without culturally-targeted, fear appeal messages. The uptake of screening was high across conditions; 95.6% of participants used the HPV self-test and returned their kits. However, surprising variations were observed in self-test acceptability, explained by differing attitudes toward the message conditions. Based on the results, we recommend 4 key components to increase HPV screening in low-resource settings: 1) focus on perceived threat in message design 2) avoid written materials due to literacy concerns 3) use culturally-appropriate interpersonal or community-based channels 4) consider alternative solutions (such as a self-test) available at no or low cost to address structural barriers.\n","Abstract Body: Guided by the extended parallel process model, this study sought to experimentally test the effects of a fear appeal messages designed to increase first-year Chinese international college students’ attitudes toward and intentions to get the HPV vaccine while in the U.S. This study used a posttest-only control-group design with random assignment to conditions (i.e., participants were randomly assigned to either the high threat-high efficacy condition or to a no message control condition). Experimental results indicate that the high threat-high efficacy message significantly increased perceptions of susceptibility and self-efficacy (but not severity and response efficacy). Further, participants in the high-threat high efficacy message reported significantly greater intentions to get (but not attitudes toward) the HPV vaccine. Finally, regression analyses indicated that the EPPM variables explained 23% of the variance in attitudes and 50% of the variance in intentions. However, only severity and self-efficacy (but not susceptibility or response efficacy) contributed significantly to the prediction of attitudes and intentions. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: In the US, the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains underutilized leading to disparities in HPV-related diseases. Latinx have some of the highest rates of cancer caused by HPV. In a previous study, we developed a tailored-messaging based online educational intervention (CHICOS) that was found to increase HPV vaccination intention among Latinx participants. The current research presents the comparative effectiveness of messages designed using the Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM) to promote the use of CHICOS among Latinx young adults and parents of adolescents. We also looked at differences in the effectiveness of messages that highlighted HPV-related cancers, genital warts, or a control condition. Results found no differences based on message content in relation to vaccination intention. However, control messages were reported to have the highest level of fear (but not susceptibility or severity)—and fear was a significant predictor of vaccination intention. Control messages also had the highest percentage of hyperlink clicks (a form of information seeking). Thus, findings suggest that fear appeals are an effective approach to promoting HPV vaccination and information seeking behavior.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Social media health campaigns have the potential to affect public opinion on health issues and shape public health behaviors. This study explores the effects of fear appeal messages with social cues in social media using the extended parallel processing model (EPPM). We use a 2 (threat: present vs. absent) × 2 (efficacy: present vs. absent) × 2 (social cues: high vs. low) factorial experimental design to examine the effects of fear appeal messages with social cues on behavioral intention to receive HPV vaccination. The sample included 478 Chinese females from 15 to 45 years of age without previous HPV vaccination. The results revealed that there was a significant main effect of threat on the intention to receive HPV vaccination. Also, a significant three-way interactive effect among threat, efficacy, and social cues was detected. These findings offer theoretical and practical implications for social media health campaigns.\n",null,"Abstracts: There is increasing evidence to show that tick-borne diseases are on the rise globally. However, many governments are reluctant or refuse to acknowledge that tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease are a serious medical threat. As organisations such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and health experts within the European Union debate questions such as: what are the effect of tick-borne diseases, what is Lyme disease, can we cure such diseases, are such diseases chronic or non-chronic, a major issue is media and government framing of the diseases. Within the National Institute of Health (NIH), CDC, and other regulatory bodies, such diseases are considered only non-chronic; however, scientific research increasingly shown such diseases are more chronic (long-term) in nature. Media reports of such diseases tend to report that these diseases are life threatening but limited in number. Thus, there is a discrepancy in how govenrments and media report on these diseases. Through the use of a systematic review of literature, we will review and critique how governments and media portray tick-borne diseases and thus perpetuate health misinformation.\n","Abstracts: The idea that citizens on such a large scale can be presented with health information that is inaccurate or misleading raises substantial ethical concerns. Drawing on my research into news representations of complementary medicine and medicinal cannabis, I will discuss the inabilities of a linear-reflectionist perspective (Briggs & Hallin 2016) to unravel and unmask the complexities arising from the convergence of highly medicalised and mediatised worlds. I will also argue for a need for news-makers to scrutinise scientism, professional turf wars, risk rhetoric, and the claims-making of different interest groups in order to make meaning of the contemporary health communication landscape.\n","Abstracts: Around the globe, images of recent floods have been captured and shared through social media. One category of image data concerns the sharing of health information and misinformation by official emergency response organizations as well as the public. This paper shares image-based data and examples from a recently completed National Science Foundation funded project. Our team used a data collection practice known as a photo-elicitation interview to capture examples of health information. This approach happens when a researcher asks an interviewee to share pictures so respondents can curate their own stories with the help of visual prompts. The images gathered when participants shared their private social media revealed the following categories: posting health advice and calling it a public service announcement, inviting experts to comment and support the credibility of posted health information, using humor and exaggerating, and providing external links to substantiate health claims.\n","Abstracts: Vaccine hesitancy has been deemed one of the top ten threats to human health by the World Health Organisation (WHO) (2019). Vaccine hesitancy is defined as “a delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccine services” (Basio, et al., 2016, p. 2984). According to Kata (2016) the Internet plays a large role in disseminating anti-vaccination messages to the public as anti-vaccination messages are more prolific on the Internet than any other media (Kata, 2016). Anti-vaccination websites often refer the reader to academic articles, yet according to Pertousis-Harris (2019) the data is often cherry picked and suffers from the fallacy of incomplete evidence. This study examines what type of articles are quoted on a self-professed, New Zealand vaccination information website to understand what type of sources are quoted and whether or not the information has been cherry picked leading to the possibility of readers to be misinformed.<br /><br /><i>References<\/i><br /><br />Basio, L.R., Corsello, G., Constantino, C., Fara, G.M., Giammanco, G., Signorelli, C., Vecchio, \\ D. & Vitale, F.

The study focuses on social drinking instead of binge drinking, as the former is the prevailing partying norm instead of the latter.  A cluster analysis identified three subgroups: Low Party Interest, Moderate Party Interest, and High Party Interest. Other results indicated that descriptive and injunctive norms and party culture among friends positively predicted social drinking frequency. Control efficacy was a significant negative predictor of social drinking behavior.\n","Abstract Body: In response to alarmingly high rates of sexual assault on college campuses, the U.S. government has called on universities to help prevent sexual assault through various programs, trainings, and campaigns. Bystander intervention campaigns, which focus on educating young adults on how to react and intervene when witnessing sexual violence, have been implemented on many university campuses across the country. Because this approach is currently the most widely utilized sexual assault prevention strategy, it is important to assess its effectiveness through theory-based research. Grounded in the theory of planned behavior (TPB), which considers the role of efficacy, intent, and perceived control in behavior change, this study evaluates a bystander intervention campaign implemented across a multi-sited university.<br />            An online survey was distributed to students (<i>N<\/i>=678) at one large northwest university, on each of its three campuses. Statistical analyses revealed five key findings: 1) there is an important difference between bystander efficacy and bystander intent; 2) formal exposure to bystander intervention does result in higher student bystander efficacy and intent; 3) student perceptions of their perceived control is associated with their bystander efficacy and intent; 4) age may be a conflicting influence in how students intend to perform bystander behaviors; and 5) bystander intervention type does not explain any variance in student bystander efficacy or intent scores across campuses. Based on these findings, implications are offered to improve bystander intervention campaigns on college campuses nationwide.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Nearly 14% of women in a large sample of college students screened positively for an eating disorder (Eisenberg, Berge, Fulkerson, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2011). Furthermore, the college environment may promote thinness via peer contexts (Forney, Holland, & Keel, 2012; Forney & Ward, 2013)). Sororities, in particular, have been shown to influence body image concerns and body esteem (e.g., Latimer, Velazquez, & Pasch, 2013; Schulken, Pinciaro, Sawyer, Jensen, & Hoban, 1997), all of which has been associated with disordered eating. However, little research has examined how norms of thinness upon entering college (i.e., peer norms, parent norms and media norms) may influence decisions to join a sorority and how both sorority participation and these early norms may independently affect later body esteem and disordered eating intentions. This study reports on longitudinal data from college females and finds that females were more likely to join a sorority if they had thin peer and media norms prior to entering college. In addition, even after controlling for thinness norms, the effect of participating in sorority life had a negative effect on body esteem. Lower body esteem entering college also predicted disordered eating intentions later on.\n","Abstract Body: The current study explores college students' dietary behaviors through the lens of the Health Belief Model (HBM). The researchers offered a qualitative analysis of HBM and its two emerging constructs namely perceived barrier and benefit, based on the individual interviews with the 23 participants. Through a thorough observation in four major academic institutions in Albany New York, the researchers were able to present and categorize the food commonly served in their specific dining areas. Moreover, the research also presented four key themes encompassing students' dietary behaviors which are: <i>c<\/i>onvenience, economic reasons, quality of food, and a healthy lifestyle<i>. <\/i>Along this line, the researchers explored the students' definition of a healthy diet which commonly linked to home, parents or guardians and upbringing. The researchers concluded from the qualitative accounts shared by the students that beliefs about a healthy diet may also be influenced by the family members.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the ability of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to predict and explain whether or not college students get the influenza vaccine, or flu shot, using both quantitative and qualitative research methods. A total of 277 college students participated in this longitudinal study. At time 1, participants answered questions regarding their past flu shot behavior, and their attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions toward obtaining a flu shot in the next 30 days. At time 2 (30 days later) participants were asked whether or not they received the influenza vaccine during the past 30 days (and those who “no” were asked a qualitative question designed to elicit their most important reasons for <i>not<\/i> doing so). Quantitative results indicate that the TPB model fit the data well (explaining 64% of the variance in intention and 12% of the variance in behavior); though only the direct paths from attitude and norms to intention, and from intention to behavior, were significant. Including <i>past<\/i> behavior did not improve the fit of the model. Qualitative results identified 12 different reasons undergraduate students did not get the flu shot in the past 30 days; the most common of which dealt with perceived behavioral control (i.e., time constraints) and attitudes (i.e., salience of behavior and concerns about the effectiveness of flu shot). Theoretical and practical implications for message development on this topic and audience are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: E-cigarettes come in thousands of flavors marketed to youth and young adults (YYAs). We assessed how daily coverage of flavored e-cigarettes on Twitter and longform media (newspapers, broadcast TV networks, and websites) disseminated over three years (12/2014-12/2017) affected time-matched survey-measured YYA perceptions (n=4470; ~4/day). Using ordinal logistic regression, we show that past 28-day e-cigarette flavor coverage predicted survey-measured beliefs that e-cigarettes taste good (agreement scale 1-4).<br />The interaction of coverage from Twitter and longform sources predicted increased strength in favorable taste perceptions (OR=1.21; 95% CI, 1.04-1.41), though the main effects of each source were not significant. We also show that media coverage of flavors consistently notes e-cigarettes taste good, and the belief that e-cigarettes taste good is associated with intentions to vape. Our novel approach to evaluating the effects of tobacco-related messages in today’s complex media landscape may strengthen claims for media influence on e-cigarette use.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates the dynamics between media and public attention on measles and vaccination coverage during the 2015 measles outbreak in Berlin, Germany. Using observational macro-level data from sixteen federal states, the study taps into news-stimulated public-attention dynamics around the outbreak. It was hypothesized that the epicentral distance would influence the observed effects of the outbreak on public attention due to a higher perceived threat susceptibility in more proximal states. Findings supported this theorizing in that public attention increased exponentially as the epicentral distance lessened. Distance mattered more in states surrounding Berlin—a discovery we termed the “Rubicon effect.” Importantly, within a small radius of the epicenter, the decay in public attention was slower, and higher rates of public attention were related to an increase in vaccination coverage among children aged 24 months. The findings, including the Rubicon effect, are discussed in light of optimal resource allocation for vaccination programs.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This content analysis study reviewed the ten-year newspaper coverage of infertility and how the issue has been framed by the media in Uganda from 2008 – 2018; as well as analysed how these frames have changed over the study period. Discussion of infertility is generally taboo in Uganda, East Africa, thus the media tends to steer clear of its presentation. According to the country’s ministry of health, however, although approximately 15% of the married heterosexual couples experience infertility, discourse historically gravitated towards a female-gender shame-and-blame game, with minimum effort to comprehensively address underlying causes and possible responses (Agaba, 2018).<br />Infertility has been defined as the failure to conceive in spite of regular unprotected sexual intercourse after two years in the absence of a known reproductive pathology (American NIHCE Guidelines, 2004); and also as the inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to live birth after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse (Mascarenhas, Cheung, Mathers, &Stevens, 2012). The World Health Organization estimates that infertility affects 80 million people worldwide, or about 1 in 10 couples, and varies from 5 to 30% between countries and regions (Bayoumi, van derPoel, ElSamani, &Boivin, 2018).<br />Uganda is one of the countries in the “African infertility belt” with the phenomenon described as “barrenness amid plenty”, which refers to the fact that infertility is often most prevalent where fertility rates are also high (Cui, 2010). In sharp contrast to this prevalence, those affected are ostracized and often lack recourse for assistance to deal with the health or any other condition underlying the infertility (Chachamovich et al., 2010). Goffman (1963) defines stigma as “the situation of the individual who is disqualified from full social acceptance” and infertility in many parts of the world is accompanied by social stigma for those affected. As a result, even discussion of this topic in the media is rare and could often be dismissive. This research will advance health communication scholarship on infertility, offer insight for journalism practice and social support and acceptance for those affected.<br /><i>New Vision<\/i> newspaper is the English daily with the highest circulation in Uganda, estimated at 30,000 copies (http://ug.business.com). The ten-year period was selected because 2008 marked the first documented record of experiences of clinical intervention of IVF and other fertility treatment in the country (Platteau et al., 2008).<br />The collected 347 articles that fit the selection criteria were analyzed for the themes and frames presented (Gant &Dean, 2007) (Höijer, 2011); and how the frames have changed over the ten-year period. Preliminary analysis revealed that newspapers in Uganda frame infertility mainly as a taboo issue, which requires intervention, due to apparent need “to apportion blame” for its prevalence. Further, print media presents infertility as a women’s health issue, and rarely focuses on male infertility. Infertility is also depicted as caused by female gender health problems. However, the proffered solution of reducing stigma and increasing public discussion of the problem points to the realization that both genders have an equal role to play in addressing infertility.<br />Newspapers tend to present a portrayal of infertility consistent with cultural-social beliefs that infertility is generally the women’s problem (Kudesia, 2018). This framing of infertility may negatively impact health seeking behaviours. However, the fact that public discussion of the issue as well as counselling are proffered as the main interventions could break the taboo of silence and bring the issue up for greater discussion and redress. The researcher is in the process of conducting analysis to review the changes of the coverage over the ten-year period.<br />\n","Abstract Body: As vlogs of healthcare product reviews from video-sharing social networks have become especially popular, patients and consumers who have the same symptoms or diseases are likely watching the vlog to obtain information about treatment for the disease and the healthcare product. This study explored the social network of video content regarding a healthcare product to discover the structure and characteristics of the network and to identify potential influencers of the networks. A network of YouTube videos regarding dupilumab showed that vloggers’ review videos play an influential role in the video-sharing social network, which potentially influences the viewer’s health-related decision making.\n","Abstract Body: Health influencers have become major new sources for health information on social media. In this study, we investigate motivations and consequences of following bloggers who suffer from cancer and share their experience. We conducted a cross-sectional survey and collected data on 1,538 followers. Some 7 percent reported to be directly affected by cancer (are or were diagnosed with cancer), 47 percent were indirectly affected (family or friends), and 46 percent reported to be generally interested in the topic. The results indicate that directly affected followers scored highest on social and expressive blog use motivations. However, both general interest and indirectly affected followers scored higher on perceived learning from the blogs and on self-reported behavioral changes induced by following the blogs. Taken together, following cancer-affected social media bloggers might help followers in different ways: directly affected followers may use them to engage in expressive activities and social interaction, which may lead to stress release. By contrast, indirectly affected and general interest followers may use them to gain new information they can learn from and to change their own behavior by taking preventive and health promoting measures.\n","Abstract Body: Despite a need for comprehensive examination of the various quality factors of online health information sites, there is little research that systematically models and presents such examinations. Applying the updated DeLone and McLean Model of Information Systems Success, this research examined how health information sites’ information quality, system quality, and service quality lead to user satisfaction and perceived benefits. Data were collected in a specific context of the National Health Information Portal, a governmental health information site in Korea (<i>N<\/i> = 506). Results indicated that of the three quality factors, information quality had significant associations with all dependent variables, including user satisfaction, intention to reuse the site, and perceived benefits of site use. There were also two indirect paths from information quality to perceived benefits, one mediated through satisfaction and the other mediated through satisfaction and then intention. Service quality had a significant association with user satisfaction, and its impact on perceived benefits occurred indirectly through user satisfaction and intention. By contrast, the role of system quality received no empirical support. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Social media virality metrics refer to aggregated counts of likes, shares, or views associated with a piece of information online. Researchers have studied virality metrics as an information and persuasive cue; however, little research has examined the mechanism behind the relationship between virality metrics and behavior intention. In the context of HIV prevention, we conducted an online experiment where 245 participants were randomized into one of for conditions (no metrics, low, medium, high). Participants entered a website and watched an HIV prevention video associated with a manipulated number of shares, then answered a post-questionnaire assessing their perceptions of the video. Findings indicate that in the high metrics condition, virality metrics increased HIV testing intention through both perceived effectiveness of the message and perceived risk of the issue. Virality metrics may bolster the effectiveness of social media health campaigns when relatively high.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigated social support exchanges on social media among people who are HIV-positive male homosexuals (PHPMHs) in China and explored how self-disclosure relates to such online activity. Analyses were based on 9,459 <i>Weibo<\/i>messages posted by 188 targeted users. Results showed that among all five types of social support messages (i.e., emotional, informational, tangible, network, esteem) the informational and emotional support messages were prevalent in the Chinese context, which is consistent with existing findings. However, different from previous studies, esteem social support was first found to be the most salient by the current investigation. Results of independent samples <i>t<\/i>-tests suggested that PHPMHs who engaged in significant self-disclosure on <i>Weibo<\/i> tended to have more frequent social support exchanges than those who did not. In particular, PHPMHs who expressed sex-seeking intentions and companionship seeking intentions were likely to post more supportive messages than those who did not express such intentions. Moreover, PHPMHs who disclosed their concerns over discrimination tended to post more emotional, informational, and esteem support messages than those who did not express discrimination concerns.\n","Abstract Body: The current study explores communication expressed by participants in a subreddit surrounding oral health care, moderated by dentists and dental hygienists. The corpus was analyzed through Leximancer, a computer-assisted program used for computational content analyses of large datasets. Users’ personal disclosures about ongoing dental concerns, advice about others’ self-care, and the role of interpersonal communication with and among health care providers emerged as dominant themes. The findings suggest that online communities may serve an important role that dentists are unable to fill in their limited interactions with individual patients. Such interaction spaces may therefore offer a fertile environment for future interventions to promote beneficial practices and achieve positive health-related outcomes.\n","Abstract Body: Improving antibiotic stewardship in upper respiratory infections (URIs) in primary care is one avenue for reducing unwarranted antibiotic prescribing and use, one of the main contributors to antibiotic resistance. Informed by the linguistic category model, this study examined the effects of linguistic abstraction in provider language during clinical interactions on a series of patient post-visit outcomes, such as satisfaction, perceived shared decision-making, and self-care efficacy. Provider talk was transcribed and analyzed using TreeTagger and LIWC from interactions between patients (N = 416) and providers (N = 17). Results indicated greater linguistic abstraction is associated with several outcomes (e.g., satisfaction and symptom monitoring efficacy). In addition, linguistic abstraction and antibiotic prescribing behavior interacted to predict several outcomes (e.g., perceived collaboration and symptom management efficacy), perhaps due to patients’ varying expectations for treatment. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: ABSTRACT<br />Research on health literacy is often characterized by an epistemic objectivity--that is health literacy is defined as a set of skills that can be quantified and measured. However, very few studies have tried to explore the concept of health literacy from patients’ perspective, drawing on their subjective experiences. We fill this gap in research by exploring health literacy skills from chronic patients’ perspective. Specifically, in this research paper, using qualitative research methods, we identified those skills that chronic condition patients perceive as important when finding, appraising and using health information in context to their self-care behaviors. Furthermore, we have also identified some of the factors that influence their health literacy. 12 focus groups were conducted in which patients from coronary artery disease and diabetic patient populations took part. It was assumed that these participants were most likely to use health information regularly. Data was transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory methodology. The study identified six key health literacy skills that chronic patients identified as important in managing their health. Findings from this study can be used as a guide for designing health literacy measures and constructs that reflect on patients’ experiences. Furthermore, findings from this study can be used for developing health literacy interventions that are in concert with cognitive and social practices enacted by patients when apprising and using health information.<br /><br />Keywords: Health Information appraisal, Health literacy, qualitative research, chronic disease<br />management, health information seeking behaviors.\n","Abstract Body: This experimental investigation utilizes stereotype content model (SCM) to explain the biases associated with the perceptions of healthcare providers. Specifically, the 2 (gender: male, female) by 2(race: Arab, Caucasian) between subjects experiment examined the impact of physician race and gender on people’s perceptions regarding physician’s communication competence, trust, and intentions to visit. The findings indicate that female physicians are considered to be not only warmer but also more competent than male physicians. White physicians are considered less competent than their minority counterparts though no differences in perceived communication competence was observed. In addition, the two dimensions of SCM, competence and warmth mediated the effect of physician gender and race (only warmth) on perceptions of trust, communication, and intentions to visit. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Patient-centered communication promotes positive patient outcomes. This study examines the linguistic markers of two key dimensions of patient-centered communication (i.e., provider empathy and shared decision-making) and their mediating effects on patient perceived quality of and affective responses to the provider’s treatment recommendations. Transcripts (<i>N<\/i> = 341) of provider talk from provider-patient interactions in medical visits for upper respiratory infection symptoms where patients were not prescribed with antibiotics were analyzed with Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary. Results showed that providers’ use of affiliation words positively predicted patients’ perceptions of their providers’ empathy. Providers’ use of insight words negatively predicted patients’ perceptions of providers’ shared decision-making. Meanwhile, providers’ use of first-person singular pronouns, causation and differentiation words, and clout words were positively related to this perception. Patients’ perceptions of their provider’s empathy and shared decision-making further increased patients’ positive affect toward and perceived quality of non-antibiotic treatment recommendations. These perceptions also reduced their negative affect toward the recommendations. Implications of the findings are discussed with regard to patient-centered communication in relation to the promotion of antibiotic stewardship.\n","Abstract Body: Across numerous cultural settings, the culture-centered approach (CCA) has made significant strides in addressing issues in ways that co-create infrastructures for marginalized communities to raise their voices and de-center ‘expert’ domination on communities (Dutta, 2008). The CCA seeks to construct dialogic spaces where people at the margins can participate, raise their issues and give solutions in locally meaningful ways to put forth theories of health and wellbeing (Dutta, 2018). Originating in postcolonial and subaltern studies, and principally exercised in health communication research, the CCA encompasses ways of examining the governing knowledge structures, striving to invert the practices of dominant narratives by involving those at the margins, attending to the challenges of the communities with voice, equality, health and accessibility (Beverly, 2004; Guha, 2001; Dutta, 2008). The key ideas that serve as the foundation of CCA are community participation, dialogue and partnerships.  These ideas examine the erasures in mainstream, seeking to foster opportunities for subaltern voices to be heard in dominant discursive registers so they can be heard.<br />Keywords: culture centered approach, poverty, indigeneity\n","Abstract Body: <br />This study investigated women’s experiences of information exchange with their providers, about their risks and potential for complications during pregnancy. Interviews were conducted with fifteen women, between the ages of 25 and 38, who had given birth within the past year. The women lived in various different states but the thematic analysis reveals similar experiences related to information exchange. Thematic analysis showed that the women’s education level influenced the type of risk information sought, and that prior knowledge about pregnancy risk lead the women to seek additional information. Further, the women reported that they felt information was withheld from them, except in the cases of genetic testing, C-section, and delivery plan. When there were complications, the women reported providers focused on acting fast rather than giving information to participants. Lastly, the women’s experiences demonstrate a need for verifying reactions to information to increase understanding. Our findings suggest that information seeking is intertwined with education level and direct or indirect (friend’s pregnancies) pregnancy experiences. Additionally, the findings suggest that women do not feel they are given enough information about complications and risk. Finally, they suggest that emotions need to be attended to in information exchange about pregnancy complications.<br />\n","Abstract Body: It is well established in the literature that understanding the communication challenges of chronic illness experiences requires situating uncertainty as a focal topic (e.g., Brashers et al., 2003; Mishel, 1990, 1999). Research has addressed the challenges that patients face in their illness uncertainty management, yet no systematic investigation has been conducted. In this paper, we argue for a tension-centered approach to uncertainty management and chronicity, which extends current illness uncertainty literature and contributes to understanding the actual dilemmas experienced in chronic illness and of the ongoing and recurring contradicting feelings and appraisals. Interview data with 32 participants with a range of chronic conditions suggest that participants experienced tensions in multi-dimensional ways. Specifically, participants experienced tensions regarding relational uncertainty in interacting with others, temporal uncertainty when trying to make sense of how the chronic disease had impacted their past, current, and future lives and identities, and embodied uncertainty as participants struggled to live with the body’s manifestations of their condition. Understanding the kinds of tensions in chronic illness uncertainty experience has theoretical implications about the complex and turbulent nature of chronic illness uncertainty management, as well as practical implications for healthcare providers and caregivers in terms of facilitating chronic illness patients’ uncertainty management throughout the illness trajectory.\n","Abstract Body: The study aims to apply psychological reactance theory to doctor-patient interactions, investigating the influence of doctors’ language use and race concordance on patients’ psychological reactance and their attitude towards the behavior advocated by doctors. A 2 (patronizing language: high vs. low) × 2 (race concordance: concordant vs. discordant) online experiment was conducted on participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (<i>N<\/i> = 439). No main effect was found for doctors’ patronizing language and race concordance, but an interaction effect on patients’ freedom threat perception was found between language use and race concordance. Patients with more psychological reactance were also more likely to develop negative attitude towards the recommended behavior. The study partially supported psychological reactance theory within the context of doctor-patient interactions. Reactance is heightened when doctors and patients are racially concordant, thereby suggesting patient resistance to doctor recommendations is attenuated in racially discordant doctor-patient interactions.\n","Abstract Body: Immigrant populations in the United States are affected by health disparities creating a disproportionate burden of cancer among them. Although FCH (family cancer history) is a compelling marker for assessing cancer risk, family history communication about cancer is very low among immigrant populations in the United States. Given that patient-provider communication is one of the core communication phenomena ineffective collection of FCH and better preventive care in primary clinics, this study aims to examine the role of patient-centered communication in promoting FCH among immigrant patients in the United States. Using Epstein and Street’s pathway model of patient-centered communication, we investigated a pathway facilitating the effects of patient-centered provider communication on immigrant patients’ familiarity with their family cancer history sequentially mediated by the discussion about family cancer history with their health care provider and family members. The analysis was conducted on a subsample of 499 immigrants acquired from a nationally representative 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey 5 (Cycle 2). The results indicated that effective patient-centered provider communication led to an improvement in patients’ familiarity with their own FCH. Additionally, the results revealed that this positive effect was mediated through FCH interactions with both health care providers and family members in a serial order. Both theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper is an autoethnographic exploration of female health issues relating to their monthly menstrual experiences. Such health issues can relate from physical pain (stomach issues, back ache, head ache), emotional issues due to hormonal changes in the body and other issues such as irregular menstruation and other problems pertaining to it. Premenstrual syndrome or PMS was initially identified as a set of psychosocial experienced by women at the beginning stages of their menstrual cycle due to lower progesterone levels in the body (Greene & Dalton, 1953). Since then, the PMS and menstrual cycle concept has been influenced by different cultural taboos and media discourses, evolving into a negatively construed social phenomenon contributing to prevalent gender bias (Markens, 1996). By using autoethnography as a method to explore this phenomenon, the authors found several themes that influence the PMS discourse as well as challenges in conducting inter-cultural health research in topics that may not seem taboo in one culture but are taboo in yet another.\n","Abstract Body: Cancer patients’ emotional health is critical for health conditions and may influence their recovery and cancer development. The current study used the 2018 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5 Cycle 2 (N = 472) to evaluate the determinants of cancer patients’ emotional health. Cancer information seeking using the Internet, patient-centered communication, social support, cancer beliefs, and health self-efficacy were examined as factors to be associated with cancer patients’ emotional health. Social support, cancer beliefs, and health self-efficacy were found to be significantly associated with cancer patients’ emotional health. Although cancer information seeking using the Internet and patient-centered communication were not directly associated with cancer patients’ emotional health, cancer beliefs mediated the association of cancer information seeking using the Internet with cancer patients’ emotional health while health self-efficacy mediated the association of patient-centered communication with cancer patients’ emotional health.\n","Abstract Body: During disease outbreaks, mass media facilitate the provision of health information to the public to protect themselves and reduce their risk of disease. Understanding how media are used during public health outbreaks, and the context in which public health information provided by local and state health departments “break through” into the news environment can help to identify effective direct response strategies for public information officers managing a measles crisis. This study informs scholarly understanding of public health discourse and recent attention to recent measles outbreaks that have galvanized attention to lack of age-appropriate immunization in priority populations. Media coverage<br />also raises stories of personal blame, misinformation, and concerns for how to address harmful personal anecdotes. This study examined news coverage of the 2017 Minnesota measles outbreak to examine the reach and quality of coverage.<br /><br />Methods<br />A random sample of all online-available news stories was coded to achieve reliability (kalpha >.70). We examined news coverage of 708 articles published in the state and nation between the first reported case of measles and the public announcement by Minnesota Department of Health that the outbreak had ended.<br /><br />These data reveal shift in newspaper communication over time. The inclusion of measles and immunization public health facts appeared infrequently, but when they did appear, there was no difference in whether they appeared in local, state, national or international sources. Facts about measles included things like severity of the disease. Facts about immunization included things like the consequences of low immunization rates. Stories containing measles facts were significantly more likely to include a call to action, referred to as person mobilization cues (p < 05). Stories that contained immunization facts were also significantly more likely to include personal mobilization cues (p <.05) than those that did not.<br /><br />Stories referencing MDH press releases were not significantly more likely to include facts about measles, but they were significantly more likely to include immunization facts (p <.05). Of sampled stories, 12.5% containing a measles fact included a personal anecdote; 7.7% of<br />sampled stories containing an immunization fact did so.<br /><br />Early in the outbreak, increased immunization was by far the most commonly proposed solution to ending measles outbreaks. Additionally, public health officials discussing the outbreak centered in the Minnesota Somali community dominated the news. In subsequent weeks, we saw a rise in coverage of local (and community-based) immunization programs and reporting on increased immunization activity in the Somali community. There was also an emerging narrative that situated on lack of immunization as a threat to public health.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />Because risk communication and public information officer communication after a disease outbreak is based on calculations and interpretations of what the public needs to know, there is often a competition for experts providing multiple messages. Public health officials were a key source of information and their messages about immunization were more likely to be included in media coverage. Understanding the sources of information and how that information was presented can help communicators develop a more effective media strategy during a public health crisis. This can improve news coverage and shift the discourse towards preventing outbreaks and building resilient communities.\n","Abstract Body: Norm information in media can impact individuals’ norm perceptions and, ultimately, their behavior. Prior to this study, little research had examined how descriptive norm information manifests in media and impacts beliefs in the real world. Using automated content analysis, we examined the prevalence of and longitudinal trends in two types of descriptive norm mentions pertaining to two behaviors across six media sources over three years. We assessed how these norm mentions affected norm perceptions over time by pairing these data with a rolling cross-sectional survey of young people’s beliefs and intentions related to these behaviors. We found that individual <i>use<\/i> norm content affected norm perceptions, although the significance and direction of effects varied depending on the source, behavior, and type of perception considered. Conversely, population norm content did not affect perceptions. These findings highlight the need for more research to identify variables that moderate the effects of media norm information.\n","Abstract Body: While the smoking rate among non-Hispanic Asian Americans (7.1%) is lower than the national average (14%), some subgroups (e.g., Vietnamese/Korean males) show disproportionately high smoking rates (~22% in California). Reflecting the target audiences’ unique characteristics in message design and dissemination, targeted communication can effectively engage under-served populations and address health disparities. However, targeting strategies are defined based on various aspects of message design, such as executional/format (e.g., showing demographically similar exemplars) and content features (e.g., using arguments reflecting appropriate cultural values), or ‘surface’ and ‘deep’ structures. The current study aimed to understand which message feature drives successful and culturally-appropriate interventions for Asian Americans.\n","Abstract Body: The usefulness of YouTube has been highlighted by researchers and practitioners to promote physical activity and exercise in terms of providing effective workout video instructions that are free and accessible, yet research in this area is still limited. This study draws on the framework of motivations in self-determination theory (SDT) to extend our understanding of why individuals take advantage of social media like YouTube to achieve a healthy lifestyle. Comments on workout videos from a popular YouTube fitness and lifestyle channel were captured and used for content analysis. This extended abstract presents the preliminary findings of the motivations and their components. Potential contributions to research and practice on health promotion and education are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study proposed the measurement of the effectiveness of videos communicating gene-edited babies and explored factors that influence effectiveness. The effectiveness can be measured by both video popularity and balanced response from the viewers. This study collected 107 most viewed videos and corresponding 56,912 direct comments about gene-edited babies from YouTube. The independent variables of the videos were manually coded. Sentiment and topics of comments were analyzed using IBM Waston Natural Language Understanding, and then sentiment polarity, sentiment divergence, and the number of topics were calculated. We found that UGC channels are more effective in communicating gene-editing baby. As for the delivery style, content creators don’t have to consider video style, but they have to take gender, video type, and video length into account to make an effective video. Compared with video tone, video frame is a more important factor to consider when making an effective video.\n","Abstract Body: Social networking (SNS) smartphone applications designed to help smartphone users to connect people and share resources in the network have been widely used. Applications of this nature have the potential to impact emotional health by providing constant access to online social support. Using automatically log tracking data, this study assesses the current SNS smartphone applications use among college students and its relationship with social support, and emotional wellbeing.\n","Abstract Body: Family health history (FHH) communication about cancer is an essential disease prevention tool. However, many people do not know their FHH because cancer is not often discussed. Research explaining FHH communication is sparse as this remains an emerging area within health communication scholarship. An individual’s online media use for health information may help explain FHH communication. Informed by the structural influence model of communication, we sought to examine the relationship between digital media use and FHH communication about cancer.\n","Abstract Body: The paper identifies how communication is associated with adverse events and which communication related events are most common in the hospital setting in Hong Kong. The data consisted of Risk Alert and Annual Reports on Sentinel Events (SEs) issued by the Hong Kong Hospital Authority from October 2007 to September 2017. Over the period studied, there were 379 reported sentinel events.  The analysis revealed that communication factors contributed to 186 SEs across eight categories of events.  Findings showed that written, and spoken+written communication breakdowns occurred at a high frequency in SEs and electronic system-related miscommunication played a less critical role. The paper reviews the official root cause analysis (RCA) recommendations made to the hospitals. It then revisits the recommendations through a social psychology and language perspective and highlights the issues around communication specificity that are not emphasized in RCA reports but that also need attention. <br />\n","Abstract Body: The Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) posits that in response to threatening messages (fear appeals), when perceived threat is high but efficacy is low, the message backfires and people act against the message recommendations. Past research found no support for this proposition, but was limited because it treated threat and efficacy as message features. In contrast, the EPPM conceptualizes threat and efficacy as both message features and audience's perceptions and past studies found that treating them as audience perceptions results in findings more consistent with the EPPM’s propositions.We tested this proposition using threat and efficacy as audience perceptions in an online experiment with 1,503 US adult smokers. Outcomes were smoking-related behavioral intentions. We also found no support for the backfiring effect. The EPPM’s “backfiring” proposition needs to be revisited in light of the overall evidence and potentially changed to “when perceived threat is high, but efficacy is low, people will still do what message recommends, just to a lesser degree.”\n","Abstract Body: A majority of U.S. adults report feeling overwhelmed by the amount of available cancer information, a phenomenon labeled <i>cancer information overload<\/i> (CIO). Given the prevalence of CIO and its possible links to health behaviors, communication researchers are leading efforts to explicate the construct, validate its measurement, and establish key boundary conditions for relationships to constructs and health behaviors. Two longitudinal studies – a colonoscopy intervention among older adults (<i>N <\/i>= 237) and an HPV vaccination intervention among young women (<i>N<\/i> = 411) – are utilized to engage four pressing questions in the CIO literature concerning measurement, reliability, validity, and relationship to behavioral intentions. The results support a revised, five-item measure of CIO which is reliable across time (test-retest reliability), distinct from conceptually similar topics such as indifference and subjective ambivalence (discriminant validity), and related to behavioral intentions in complex, and somewhat unexpected, ways.\n","Abstract Body: Many people mistakenly believe that nicotine is the cause of diseases in cigarettes. This project evaluates the necessity and possibility of correcting people’s nicotine misperception as a means to influence their use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). In Study 1, tobacco users took a survey to report their perception of nicotine harm, and their attitude and intention towards using NRT and e-cigarettes. Results show that overestimation of nicotine harm was associated with e-cigarette attitude and intention, but not with NRT. Informed by the survey results, three correction messages, a nicotine message, an NRT message, and an e-cigarette message, were developed and experimentally tested in Study 2. The nicotine message lowered people’s perception of nicotine harm but it cannot change people’s tobacco product use. The NRT message failed to influence NRT attitude and intention either. The e-cigarette message significantly lowered people’s attitude and intention to use e-cigarette.\n","Abstract Body: An audio podcast called <i>Kim Saeng-min’s Receipts<\/i>, created and hosted by two female comics, witnessed a short-lived but extreme virality until it ceased to air after its third host, a man, was found to have sexually assaulted women. Building on Banet-Weiser (2018), I analyze this show as an instance in which an interlocution of popular feminism and everyday misogyny took place. Claiming to be financial counseling provided by a male comedian known as frugal, hardworking, and money-savvy, the show brought personal finance into the realm of popular culture. While the show set itself apart from the openly misogynistic popular culture prevalent in South Korea in the mid-2010s, Kim Saeng-min’s financial advice to listeners smacked of ingrained misogyny by reproducing stereotypical images of pathological female consumers and by naturalizing their “irrational” behaviors. At the same time, however, one of the show’s female hosts, Kim Sook, shamelessly disclosed her indulgent lifestyle in defense of female over-spenders and their apparently irrational acts. Whereas consumption-for-empowerment rhetoric has functioned as one of the most predominant postfeminist tropes in the West, Kim Sook’s self-deprecation as an irrational, excessive consumer should be seen as a form of what Gilbert (1997) called “marginal humor.” Focusing on her self-deprecating humor, intertextual persona, and enactments of gender non-conformity, I argue that she performed the marginality of pathological female consumers, who were long seen as the bearers of social ills. Therefore, the interlocution of feminism and misogyny played out in two different ways in <i>Receipts<\/i>: (1) while representing female comedians’ unprecedented accomplishments in overcoming marginalization and reinventing themselves, it enabled a sexual culprit’s unwittingly rise to stardom, and (2) it juxtaposed a male pedagogue lampooning female consumers with an unruly woman transgressing ideal femininities, including the femininity stereotypes created by highly gendered consumption discourses.\n","Abstract Body: This study explored the extent to which stigmatized attitudes about mental health within one’s family and community socialize one’s orientation toward mental health treatment and how these relationships vary across rural-nonrural areas. Using self-report data (N = 304), path models examined the extent to which perceived family and perceived community mental health stigma predict self-stigma, perceived public stigma, and perceived importance of formal treatment (mental health practitioner and general practitioner) and informal support (family and friends). Multigroup analysis assessed differences across rural-nonrural areas for each type of informal support and formal treatment provider. Results indicated that perceived family and community mental health stigma both positively predicted self-stigma, whereas perceived community mental health stigma also emerged as a positive predictor of public stigma. In addition, self-stigma mediated the association between perceived family and community mental health stigma and perceived treatment importance for formal treatment providers. Although findings suggest that family and community stigma influence one’s orientation toward mental health treatment seeking, analyses did not reveal significant differences present in the model across rural-nonrural contexts. Implications for assessing disparate rates of mental health treatment seeking in rural communities and ways of assessing rurality that consider community-level norms are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Depression in older adults is associated with decreased physical, cognitive, and social functioning, which in turn, are associated with increased mortality. Research has found that robust social networks can protect against depression, yet it is unclear whether the relationship between social ties and depression is reciprocal. Moreover, links between network connections at different social layers is not well understood. This study uses a representative sample with panel data over ten years to identify the influence of social network composition on subsequent depression and explore how various layers of human relationships (e.g., community vs. interpersonal level) influence one another. Results demonstrate multiple links between social connection and depression, and that the evolution of social networks in older adults is complex, with distinct mechanisms leading to positive and negative outcomes.\n","Abstract Body: This article aims to understand the ways in which Korea has shaped and developed AI-driven algorithmic cultural production. It first examines the ways in which Korean cultural industries firms utilize AI and algorithms to advance the new form of cultural production. It then documents the Korean government’s own rapid development of AI-relevant policies. In particular, it draws on the active engagement in the process and builds on the legacy of Korean digital platforms and cultural policies. Finally, it discusses whether the Korean government and corporations have advanced reliable public and corporate policies and ethical codes to secure socio-economic equality. As McKelvey and MacDonald (2019, 44) argue, policy mechanisms and AI initiatives must be understood “from a critical perspective that considers development, deployment, and impact from a wide diversity of voices beyond the tech sector.” Therefore, it discusses these questions from a critical political economy perspective which emphasizes, not only power relationships between the politics and the economy, but also socio-economic justice and equality.\n","Abstract Body: <br />This study examined live-in, foreign domestic helpers’ (FDHs) experiences with and adaptation to abuse and exploitation at work. A mixed-method design was adopted that incorporated a face-to-face survey with 106 FDHs and 21 in-depth interviews. The results showed that most participants experienced some forms of abuse and exploitation. Verbal threats and time exploitation were the most common forms of abuse and exploitation respectively. Participants preferred emotion-based coping over problem-based coping, which was present in their acceptance of employer orders, avoidance of negotiation, and withholding. Their major sources of emotional support were religion and friends who also worked as FDHs in Hong Kong. Employers had the potential to fulfill participants’ needs for emotional, informational, and instrumental support. The results shed light on FDHs’ use of internal and external personal resources to deal with workplace conflicts and provide suggestions for ways to improve their work life in Hong Kong. <br /><br />Keywords:  foreign domestic helpers, social support, abuse, exploitation, coping\n","Abstract Body: One of the most critical arenas for conflict between parents and their children relates to food. Yet it remains largely unexplored why food-related conflicts between parents and their children occur. Given that especially parents play a significant role in modeling children’s eating habits, we filled this pressing research gap by exploring how the use of parental communication strategies and parental feeding practices affect the emergence of parent-child conflicts about food. Results of a two-wave panel study with parents in COUNTRY (N = 541) indicate that parents’ use of restrictive patterns is a trigger of food conflicts. This effect was particularly pronounced when parents reward their children with unhealthy food. Moreover, inconsistent parental measures (i.e., a combined use of restrictive food-related mediation and unhealthy food as a reward) increased the conflict potential. However, other parental measures, such as active food-related mediation and covert control, did not increase nor decrease food-related conflicts with respect to both unhealthy as well as healthy food.\n","Abstract Body: Narratives are an effective tool for influencing health behavior, particularly through increased audience emotional engagement. Outcome narratives – narratives focused on the consequences of health choices – are useful for increasing cancer screening intentions. Past research has compared two types of melanoma outcome narratives including death and survivor narratives, but their relative emotional impact has not been tested. The current study compared melanoma survivor and death narratives in a 2 (death vs. survivor) × 4 (stories of Marla, Erin, Don, and Ray) between-participant experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 735; <i>M<\/i> age = 44.86, <i>SD<\/i> = 16.79). Death narratives indirectly increased sun safe behavior expectations (SSB) and skin self-exam expectations (SSE)  through increased fear, sadness, anger, and surprise. However, death narratives also indirectly decreased both SSB and SSE through increased counterarguing. Survivor narratives indirectly increased SSE through increased happiness and contentment. Results have implications for the drive model, extended parallel process model, and cognitive-functional model.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Psychological reactance theory proposes that the legitimacy of interference, along with threat and personal trait, might influence the magnitude of reactance among recipients. Also, the theory also proposes several different types of freedom restoration. This paper proposed a 2 (threat: low vs. high) <i>×<\/i> 3 (source: CDC, victim of the health issue vs. AI) <i>×<\/i> 2 (health topics: college drinking vs. STD) between subjects experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 765) to explore these two questions. Results showed that message source with different levels of legitimacy could influence people’s reactance, as a result, people engage in several different types of freedom restoration simultaneously. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Based on the psychic numbing theory, this study draws on a survey experiment (<i>n<\/i>=403) data to understand not only what statistical evidence in risk messages does to recipients’ emotion intensity, but also how emotion intensity influence risk perception and efficacy respectively in the process of active risk information management. Findings from the final moderated mediation model suggest that risk perception and efficacy mediate the relationship between perceived relevance and active communication intentions. However, the indirect path to active communication intentions operating through risk perception is only affected by negative emotion intensity, whereas the indirect path to active communication intentions operating through efficacy is only affected by positive emotion intensity. This result highlights the significantly different roles of positive and negative emotion intensity in one’s information management process. Implications for the functioning of the psychic numbing theory on emotion intensity and use in risk communication are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Opioid stigma leads to devastating consequences for opioid misusers, including anxiety and depression (Akdag et al., 2018). Whether intended or not, mass media may stigmatize opioid misusers by ascribing stigmatizing labels (e.g. “opioid addict”) and other stigma features to opioid misusers. However, it is unclear how this stigmatizing language influences the public’s perceptions of opioid misusers and their support for pro-rehabilitation and Naloxone policies. The Model of Stigma Communication (MSC; Smith, Zhu, & Fink, 2017) provides a framework for understanding these relationships. This study uses the MSC in two online factorial experiments, the first among college undergraduates (<i>N <\/i>= 231) and the second among Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (<i>N <\/i>= 245) to examine how opioid stigma messages influence opioid-related outcomes. Results indicated that opioid stigma messages led to danger appraisal, which negatively impacted opioid-related policy support and led to more desired social distance, stigma sharing, and other negative outcomes.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Health communicators in the United States face substantial challenges in their efforts to increase parent uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine for their children. One major set of challenges involves low levels of trust in medical science, pharmaceutical companies, and government health agencies who promote vaccination. We conducted a two-wave randomized experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 1,000 at time 1, <i>t<\/i>1, <i>N<\/i> = 803 at time 2, <i>t<\/i>2) to test whether messages designed to convey the expertise, trustworthiness, or caring/goodwill of a governmental source of information (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) increased perceived source credibility and parent intentions to vaccinate their children. Contrary to predictions, a message designed to convey source expertise produced greater perceived caring/goodwill among parents overall. Among vaccine hesitant parents, messages designed to convey source expertise and trustworthiness produced greater perceived trustworthiness, while the message designed to convey caring/ goodwill produced backfire effects on some sub-components of perceived credibility.\n","Abstract Body: This experimental study aims to explore how the side effect descriptors of written medication information (WMI) relate to perceived risks, optimistic bias, and intentional medication non-adherence (IMNA). The analysis of the side effect descriptors, type of disease, type of side effect, and perceived likelihood of side effects showed that side effect descriptors significantly affect the likelihood of developing side effects compared to the other two factors. The perceived likelihood of side effect descriptors (verbal, percentages, frequency) differed significantly, with verbal descriptors tending to overestimate risk more significantly than numeric descriptors. Multiple regression analyses for IMNA effect factors have shown that perceived side effect susceptibility has a significant effect on IMNA. The study also looked at the presence of an optimistic bias in the perceived likelihood of medicine side effects. While there is an optimistic bias in general negative events, it has been found that when it comes to side effects, the perceived likelihood for others is not higher than that for oneself. In particular, if individuals have experienced side effects, they are more likely to experience more side effects than other people. This risk recognition can be related to phenomena like the ‘pill scare’ and the ‘nocebo effect’ created by side effects. This study suggests that side effect descriptors can be an important communication tool associated with feelings, perceptions, and behaviors towards medicine.\n","Abstract Body: The purpose of this study is to examine any relationship between human motivational system and responsibility attribution in the realm of health risk communication. Theoretically guided by appraisal theories of emotion, this study employed anger as a mediating variable to assess perceived effectiveness of messages in general and urgent health risk situation. Verifying the aforementioned, seven hypotheses and two research questions were extracted. Except for the hypothesis which posited positive relationship between anger and perceived message effectiveness, all the hypotheses were supported. In health risk situations, human motivational system and attribution of responsibility were both increased and anger arisen in health risk situations promoted communicative action. Although perceived effectiveness of each message differed from one another in general and urgent health risk situation, it is proved as a critical factor anticipating a communicative action in health risk situation.<br />\n","Abstract Body: An online experiment with a 2 (message format: story vs. nonstory) X 2 (message sidedness: one-sided and two-sided refutational) between-subjects design was conducted among 271 Internet users to test the effectiveness of narrative messages as a potential tool for correcting health misinformation. Results revealed that stories were more emotionally involving than nonstories but did not reduce audience resistance when used as correction messages. The study found e-cigarette smoking history moderated the effects on correction messages. For participants who do not have an e-cigarette smoking history, the one-sided story corrective was the most favored which elicited least counterarguing, was rated strongest in terms of message strength, and resulted in greater message-congruent attitude and policy support. However, for participants who have smoked e-cigarettes before, the two-sided story corrective outweighed the one-sided story by eliciting less audience resistance and being rated stronger in terms of message strength. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Adolescent substance use is a global health concern in many countries (World Health Organization, 2009). Consumption of alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana is linked to other risky behaviors such as drunken driving, unsafe sex, and violence (Cavazos-Rehg et al., 2016; Paul, Fitzjohn, Herbison, & Dickson, 2000; Vagi, Olsen, Basile, & Vivolo-Kantor, 2015). For adolescent substance use prevention research, there are ample evidences to support protective effects of school-based interventions on reducing the experiment and continuation of substance use in the developed countries such as the United States (Hecht, Shin, Pettigrew, Miller-Day, & Krieger, 2018; Pettigrew et al., 2016). Yet, less efforts have been made to address the public health concern in the developing countries including Nicaragua. Nicaraguan adolescents are at high risk for substance use due to an easy access to the trafficking of substances (Dudley, 2010). It is also concerning that legal sanctions against substance use are not strictly enforced in Nicaragua (Pettigrew, Sohn, Dalton, Castillo, & Allsup, 2015).<br /><br />Guided by a cultural grounding approach (Colby et al., 2013), a school-based intervention for drug and violence prevention, titled as Dale se REAL (DeR), is designed and implemented to Nicaraguan adolescents. DeR is a culturally adapted version of keepin’ it REAL, which is listed as an evidence-based school intervention on Youth.gov (https://youth.gov/content/keepin’-it-real) and the recommendation of the U.S. Surgeon General’s (2016) report on addiction (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2016). DeR teaches drug resistance strategies (Refuse, Avoid, Explain, Leave) to Nicaraguan adolescents by showing five videos consisting of one introductory video and four drug resistance strategies videos. Each video is five minutes long and is shown to students at different class times.<br /><br />By integrating narrative engagement theory (Miller-Day & Hecht, 2013) and social cognitive theory (Bandura, 2004) as theoretical frameworks, the present study aims to test direct and indirect effects of narrative engagement (i.e., perceived interest, realism, identification with main characters) of DeR intervention videos on adolescent refusal self-efficacy and substance use behaviors (i. e., alcohol, cigarette, marijuana use) in Nicaragua. The current study also proposes to examine moderating effects of peer communication about the intervention videos (i. e., frequency and positive valence of peer communication about the intervention videos) on the relationship between refusal self-efficacy and substance use behaviors. Using the cross-sectional survey data collected from 8th graders (N = 224), path analysis was run to test the mediated moderation model. Due to the non-normality of data distribution, robust maximum likelihood estimation method was chosen. To test the indirect effects, bootstrapping was employed to obtain the 95% bias-corrected confidence intervals (Preacher & Hayes, 2008).<br /><br />The model fit the data well:(χ2 [14] = 16.794; RESEA = .034; CFI = .984; SRMR = .047). The results revealed that as adolescents perceived the storylines of the intervention videos more realistic, they were likely to report high levels of self-efficacy to refuse drug offers by others (b = .303, SE = .091, p = .001). The results, however, did not yield support for direct and indirect effects of interest and identification with main characters.<br />Significant moderation effect was detected such that frequent communication strengthened the negative relationship between refusal self-efficacy and the past 30-days marijuana use (b = -.126, SE = .051, p = .014). That is, as adolescents who reported high levels of refusal self-efficacy engaged in frequent conversations about the intervention videos, they were less likely to report the past 30-days marijuana use. The analysis, however, did not detect any other moderating effects of peer communication. Findings suggest that health communication scholars should take into consideration social determinants and cultural factors for adolescent substance use prevention research in Nicaragua.\n","Abstract Body: Vaccination compliance has become a relevant issue within past years as cases of vaccine-preventable diseases continue to rise (Patel et al., 2019). Recent research has sought to understand how vaccination compliance can be bolstered with many turning to narratives appeals (Walter et al., 2017). However, there is a general lack of understanding in how narrative messages are processed with different vaccines as the majority of research only investigates one vaccine when comparing different kinds of messages (e.g., HPV: Nan et al., 2017). In order to better understand whether the type of vaccine impacts subsequent message effects, this study tests whether equivocal information about the measles and the seasonal flu are perceived differently when presented in a statistical and narrative format. This study pays particular attention to the outcome of perceived risk, in addition to behavioral intention, due to the vast literature supporting risk reduction as a vital component in increasing vaccination compliance (Betsch & Sachse, 2012).  <br />Method and Results<br />            A 2 x 2 between-subjects online experiment (N = 124) was conducted. Storyboard videos (i.e., a series of narrated images) were manipulated to feature either a narrative storyline or a statistical presentation regarding either the MMR or the flu vaccine. All health information was matched between conditions; that is, only shared symptoms between the measles and flu were presented to maintain equivalency in information quantity and quality. Variable descriptive statistics can be found in Table 1.<br />            Two ordinary least-squares (OLS) regressions estimated the effects of message and vaccine type on perceived risk and behavioral intention, controlling for transportation and message reactance (see Table 2). Main effects of message and vaccine type were found. In general, narrative and flu messages produced riskier perceptions of vaccination compared to statistical and MMR messages. Of great interest, a significant interaction was observed. Graphically presented in Fig. 1, the effect of a narrative message (vs. statistical) appeared contingent on what vaccine was being targeted. While narrative messages about the flu caused safer risk perceptions than statistical messages, focus on the MMR vaccine saw a decrease in perceived safety. No main or interaction effects were found regarding behavioral intention.<br />Discussion and Conclusion<br />This study’s goal was to better understand how message features influence people’s perceptions of vaccination. Specifically, this study tested whether the message type (narrative vs. statistical) and the vaccine discussed (MMR vs. flu) influenced risk perceptions and behavioral intention. The results revealed that narrative messages were generally less effective in garnering safe vaccine perceptions; however, this effect was most pronounced when about the measles. For flu messages, the narrative condition saw an increase in positive risk perceptions (i.e. vaccines are safe). This finding has several implications. First, as research continues to investigate how narratives can be used to advocate vaccination compliance, this study’s results stress the importance of considering vaccine type in future theoretical and effects-based work. Specific vaccines may incur different effects and be processed uniquely, and thus should be accounted for. Second, for health communicators and practitioners, the results suggest practical strategies for what types of messages to disseminate. If the campaign’s goal, for example, is to reduce the perceived risk of the MMR vaccine due to increased misinformation, messages providing statistical content may be better preferred compared to narratives, a more implicit persuasive strategy. It is worth acknowledging that no significant effects of the manipulations were found for behavioral intention. Consequently, while this study has defined implications for risk perceptions, the link between message and vaccine type on behavioral intent remains unclear.\n","Abstract Body: One possible way of enhancing the effectiveness of health narratives is by using tailoring. However, evidence on the effectiveness of narrative tailoring is mixed. Some studies have found tailoring to be effective, while others have found no difference between tailored and non-tailored stories. One explanation for these mixed results is that previous research has largely ignored “best practices” as recommended by the non-narrative tailoring literature. This study provided a more robust test of narrative tailoring by comparing two different versions of a tailored health narrative to a non-tailored narrative and a facts only control. Results found that the narrative conditions outperformed the control; there was no significant difference between tailoring conditions on vaccination expectations, narrative transportation, identification, or perceived customization. Further analysis showed that perceived customization and narrative transportation predicted vaccination expectations across all narrative conditions.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the interaction effect of message format (narrative vs. non-narrative) and message framing (gain vs. loss) in e-cigarette prevention targeted at young adults. Results of a two-way experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 439) revealed that discrete negative emotions (i.e. guilt and sadness) mediated the relationship between message effect and risk perception, as well as behavioral intention. Compared to the other conditions, the gain-framed narrative message evoked the lowest amount of guilt, which led to increased risk perception and decreased intention to use e-cigarette in the future. In contrast, the loss-framed narrative message evoked the highest amount of sadness, which led to increased risk perception and decreased behavioral intention. This research contributes to the literature on narrative persuasion and emotion and provides insight for health intervention related e-cigarette prevention.\n","Abstract Body: One of the most important influences on tobacco-related beliefs is the media. In this study, we assess the relationship between media coverage of tobacco addiction and the belief that smoking leads to addiction. We used crowd-sourced and automated coding techniques to code ‘long-form’ texts (mass media and website articles) and tweets for explicit references to tobacco addiction over a three-year period, and concurrently conducted a rolling cross-sectional survey of 11,847 youth and young adults (age 13-25; ~10/day) on their beliefs about tobacco addiction. We found that a higher volume of addiction-related tweets – and their interaction with addiction-related long-form content – was positively associated with addiction belief endorsement. Oddly, predictive margins indicated that belief endorsement was high when both sources’ coverage was low <i>and<\/i> when both sources’ coverage was high, but low when coverage diverged (long-form coverage=high, Twitter coverage=low). Results underscore the importance of investigating the effects of a complex communication environment.\n","Abstract Body: To better understand the processing of e-cigarette preventions messages, we conducted a content analysis of 1,968 participants’ open-ended responses to one of four messages, which focused on industry manipulation (<i>Big tobacco<\/i>), financial cost of vaping (<i>Can’t afford<\/i>), harmful chemicals in e-cigarettes (<i>Formaldehyde<\/i>), or uncertainty about the ingredients of e-liquids (<i>Top secret<\/i>). Health Belief Model (HBM) and perceived message effectiveness (PME) constructs were coded and the frequency of each variable was compared across message conditions. Findings suggested that of the HBM constructs, perceived health threat had most mentions overall and in the <i>Formaldehyde<\/i> condition. Self-efficacy of not vaping had fewest mentions across all messages. For PME, people reported most positive evaluations about <i>Big tobacco<\/i> in terms of its message features. <i>Formaldehyde<\/i> received most positive evaluations in terms of its persuasion effects. The findings suggest future anti-vaping messages addressing the efficacy element and combining different themes to communicate the harm of e-cigarettes.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores the independent and interactive effects of pictorial imagery (present versus absent) and size (50% vs 30%) of tobacco product warning labels on youth’s visual attention to the warning label and brand imagery, negative affect, cognitive elaboration, health risk beliefs and susceptibility to smoke. To test these effects, we conducted a two by two plus one (control group) between-subjects randomized experiment among middle school youth (N = 494). We unobtrusively measured visual attention using eye tracking technology while participants viewed nine tobacco packages with warning labels and then completed a short survey following exposure. We found a main effect of pictorial image and size. More specifically, labels with pictorial warnings and 50% size labels resulted in great visual attention to the warning and less attention to brand content than text-only and 30% size labels respectively. Labels with pictorial images also produced greater reports of negative affect than those without such imagery. There were no main or interactive effects of either warning design feature on cognitive elaboration, risk beliefs, or susceptibility. Results indicate that 50% pictorial warning labels may be necessary to promote visual attention to warning label content and increase negative feelings toward smoking.\n","Abstract Body: Smoking is linked to multiple health problems, but it is also the biggest preventable cause of premature death. Therefore, an important goal in health communication is to improve the effectiveness of campaigns targeted to smokers. The present study focuses on smoking prevention using narrative messages in which a former smoker described the process of quitting smoking and the improvements experienced since then. The role of two narrative devices was analyzed in an online experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 680) with a 2 (narrative voice: first vs. third-person message) x 2 (audience-character behavioral similarity: low vs. high) between-subjects factorial design. Results showed that the first-person narrative with a high-similar protagonist condition induced the highest levels of identification. Moreover, mediational analyses showed that identification with the protagonist, reactance and counterarguing were significant mediators. The present work opens an innovative line of research on the construction of narrative messages for smoking prevention.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Background: Young adult e-cigarette usage has become a major public health issue. Previous work has examined how outcome expectancies [OE] predict usage, but it is unclear how a person’s personal networks may influence these effects.<br /><br />Methods: We surveyed a convenience sample of 288 young adults from a large public university. Respondents completed a survey including three sets of e-cigarette OEs, composition and structure of two discussion networks (health discussion and social interaction networks), and current e-cigarette use. <br /><br />Results: Results indicated the presence of largely distinct networks with differential impacts on e-cigarette use. Health discussion network members were older and had stronger ties with respondents than social interaction network members, who were more likely to use e-cigarettes. Higher proportions of e-cigarette users in health discussion networks was associated with OEs about e-cigarette enjoyment and social influences (<i>p<\/i> < .001) and higher respondent e-cigarette usage (<i>p<\/i> < .001). Multivariable block-wise logistic regression indicated the following predicting current e-cigarette usage: positive personal experience (OR = 2.35) and social influence (OR = 2.12) OEs; higher proportions of e-cigarette users in health discussion networks (OR = 2.20); more densely connected health discussion networks (OR = 2.88); and greater proportions of e-cigarette users in social interaction networks (OR = 2.39).<br /><br />Conclusions: Our study provides preliminary evidence for the importance of two key discussion network dimensions in predicting young adult e-cigarette usage - proportion and density. Further research advancing an understanding of young adults’ e-cigarette use should consider employing personal network methods.<br /><br />\n","Abstracts: In discussing health disparities from a culture-centered approach, a structural analysis offers the shaping and conceptualizing of the barriers faced when working through health disparities in the context of disenfranchisement. Health vulnerabilities anchored in how structures disable populations from acquiring equitable health are central in the discussion of inequalities faced. The panel will address CCA interventions on health inequalities from the US, New Zealand and Southeast Asia reflecting the role of structural actors in the reproduction of racist discourse in the everyday life of vulnerable communities, exacerbating these health inequalities. In these interventions, racist structures are discussed in the amplification of health disparities faced by vulnerable populations.\n",null,"Abstracts: In the backdrop of global transformation of agriculture adhering to the neoliberal logic of high yield for high profit, Indian farmers are facing an epidemic of farmer suicides spanning over more than two decades. In this backdrop, our Culture-Centered interventions tell a story of hunger, poverty, indebtedness, suicide, and extreme precarity of farming-based livelihood. The narratives of lived experiences amid the agrarian crisis co-constructed in dialogue with farmer widows disrupt the neoliberal narrative of development based on profits. Hunger of the farmer is an entry point that comes up in our culture-centered intervention to discuss how we discuss food, and the rights of those who feed the world, the farmers. Communicative sovereignty as an emergent theme in our work is associated with food sovereignty movements in the Global South.\n","Abstracts: In Aotearoa New Zealand the deleterious effects of colonisation exacted upon indigenous communities continue. Health and social inequities resound. Many Indigenous organisations have chosen to develop their own interventions and solutions to address these inequities and ensure they are culturally-grounded and based in Indigenous knowledge. This session shares the perspectives of two scholars who have worked on Indigenous frameworks in Aotearoa that have been influenced by the cultural-centered approach (‘CCA’). The first includes examples of how a university and two Māori social/health service providers have developed health and housing interventions to address needs of kaumātua (elders). The second sought out the meanings of health and wellbeing articulated by some iwi [tribe] members, whose voices had been erased from mainstream and indigenous spaces. The CCA positions communities resigned to the margins as the experts of their own realities fully able to co-construct health and wellbeing meanings, challenges and re-imaginings.\n","Abstracts: Culture-centered interventions addressing poverty seek to bring about structural transformations through partnerships with the poor. These partnerships are anchored in building communication infrastructures for the voices of the poor, owned by the poor. In this presentation, we will compare and contrast culture-centered interventions in India, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, and the US to examine the interplays of power and control in the creation of communication infrastructures. The variegated forms of neoliberal transformation across the globe has resulted in the erasure of poverty from the discursive space, systematically deploying the language of growth and efficiency to remove democratic platforms for the participation of the poor. In this backdrop, how do culture-centered interventions build communication infrastructures that challenge hegemonic structures? How do the articulations of the poor create discursive registers for social change?\n","Abstracts: In this presentation we draw on three HIV ethnographies in India to underline how structures interact with health and organizational values to generate uniquely local cultural narratives. These narratives, of truck drivers plying the highways of the country, of a local NGO in Nagaland working with female sex workers, and of sex workers in Kolkata, highlight the essence of the CCA, which is to advance transformative politics in everyday practices of interpretation and action.\n","Abstract Body: Over the past decades, research in the fields of both framing and health communication has grown exponentially. However, to date, no systematic review has been conducted about how framing—as a concept—has been used in health communication. The present study provides a systematic review of articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals (<i>N<\/i> = 316). The results reveal that the most common topics in the literature on framing in health communication were related to cancer, nutrition, and vaccination. Most articles use quantitative research designs, most commonly surveys with experimental designs; the majority of articles are based on the psychological tradition of framing. Thematic and generic frames occur almost equally, while the lack of research on visual frames is clearly noticeable. More than half of the effect studies test the effects of gain and loss framing, whereas competitive frames are under-studied. These findings help to identify current research trends and gaps.\n","Abstract Body: The pervasiveness of the Internet has raised concern about its potentially detrimental effects, in particular about problematic or excessive use, which can negatively affect different aspects of everyday life, including physical, mental and psychosocial functioning, especially in younger generations. One of the most-discussed subjects in this field is neuroticism and its consequences on internet use. A comprehensive quantitative synthesis of the existing literature on neuroticism and online media use and addictive use is the aim of this study. For this purpose, a meta-analysis was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (Shamseer et al., 2015). We researched all studies investigating neuroticism personality and online activities, including addictive use. When it comes to non-addictive online media activities, effect sizes were generally small and frequently non-significant, with some exceptions. For addictive online media activities, a completely different picture emerged: high levels of neuroticism significantly correlate with all measures of online media addiction, including Internet, social media, Facebook, smartphone, and online gaming addiction. Explanations are sought in neurotic people heavily relying on self-perceived effects of media use and in shortcomings of the internet addiction variables. More psychometric and mixed methods research is needed to evaluate if neurotic people are really an at-risk population.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Responsibility frames shape perceptions of health issues including obesity, depression, and diabetes, specifically regarding responsibility attributions for their causes and treatment. They affect not only individual health behavior but also the willingness to help others and health policy support. This first systematic narrative review of this topic includes all studies on responsibility frames in the media published since 2004 (<i>N<\/i> = 69 studies: <i>n<\/i> = 13 experiments; <i>n<\/i> = 56 content analyses). Content analyses show an almost exclusive media focus on responsibility attributions at the individual level (<i>n<\/i> = 30). However, experiments show that the overrepresentation comes with specific consequences: While responsibility frames were mostly unrelated to recipients’ responsibility attributions, individual (vs. societal) media responsibility frames effectively reduced (vs. facilitated) individual-level support for health policies. The research dualism is challenging because it might divert the focus away from a third level of low-threshold, cost-effective health support: the social network.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined the relationship between information seeking and fear of Zika during a global health crisis. A longitudinal survey of women in the Southern U.S. (<i>N<\/i> = 306) was conducted in 2016 beginning just days after the World Health Organization declared Zika a global crisis. The data showed that fear stimulated information seeking in waves 1-2, after which information seeking caused fear in waves 2-3. This pattern held regardless of whether participants were pregnant or planning to become pregnant (high personal relevance) versus neither (low personal relevance). Results suggest that information seeking should not be assumed to produce uniformly attractive outcomes and that health agencies should proactive behaviors of individuals during a disease crisis.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study explored the relationship between information seeking and the perceived stress levels of informal Alzheimer’s and dementia caregivers. Individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia (collectively referred to as AD) deteriorate over time, and there will likely be a corresponding increase in levels of stress for caregivers. The study involved conducting interviews to answer the following research questions: (1) What motivating factors lead informal caregivers of people with AD to seek out information?; (2) Is there a relationship between information seeking and resulting perceived stress levels?; and (3) Why do informal caregivers choose to utilize certain resources more than others during their information seeking process? Findings revealed that caregivers tend to rely on mediated resources that they find credible, and interpersonal resources such as people with similar experiences to their own. Many participants were satisfied with information available, but others felt that their interactions with healthcare professionals created more stress and emotional anguish than anticipated. This study offers an initial step in finding ways that a combination of communication sources can meet the healthcare needs of those who seek to mitigate their stress through information seeking. By studying the information needs of the caregiving population, healthcare workers and communicators will be more knowledgeable about the relationship between information seeking and stress and coping.\n","Abstract Body: In 2015, Nepal was hit by a series of powerful earthquakes. More than a million Nepalese currently live outside of their home country while maintaining deep social and economic ties. When Nepal was hit by the disastrous earthquakes, the traditional channels of communication were disrupted affecting the immigrants’ ability to check on their friends and family members’ safety. The purpose of this study was to understand the communication behavior of Nepalese immigrants during this event, and how the exposure to information about damage and destruction affected their mental well-being. This study conducted a survey of Nepalese living outside of the country (N = 228). Findings showed that Nepalese immigrants first learned about the events through a phone call from a friend or relative, consistent with previous findings that people use personable channels of communication to alert those in their social network in an unexpected disaster events. This study found that social media, especially, <i>Facebook<\/i> was the second most used platform to share the news. Additionally, personal accounts posted on social media influenced Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS), more than the exposure to images and videos of the events. Implications and recommendations for future studies are further discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Drawing on the Social Cognitive Theory and the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking, this study proposed a theoretical framework that systematically looks at the individuals’ self-management mechanisms in the context of eHealth (i.e., the use of information and communication technologies for health). Patient-centered communication and social support are believed to increase self-efficacy, which further enhances one’s perceptions of eHealth tools and motivates eHealth usage behaviors. The framework was tested with a nationally representative survey in the United States (N = 965). The results have established social support and patient-centered communication as two important sources of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy and characteristics of eHealth tools predict higher utility, which further positively predicts the engagement of eHealth behaviors. Utility appears as a partial mediator between characteristics of eHealth tools and the engagement in eHealth behaviors.\n","Abstract Body: Scholarship has suggested that the use of online health information (OHI) affects patient participation during medical encounters. However, previous research has only examined this relationship using self-report measures. Drawing from unique online trace data and videotaped observations of 232 newly diagnosed cancer patients, this study investigates how OHI use affects patient participation during medical consultations. Patient received a preparatory hospital website as part of an educational intervention, which was well used (<i>M<\/i> = 35 minutes). Patients who spent more time viewing online information prior to their visit asked more questions during consultation, although this relation did not hold when controlling for contextual factors (i.e., demographics, medical background, information preferences, and consultation characteristics). Interestingly, the breadth of patients’ website use (i.e., the number of web pages consulted) did affect question-asking behavior. Patients who viewed more web pages with practical information asked more questions about medical topics during consultation. These results suggest that it is not <i>how long <\/i>patient spend consulting OHI, but rather <i>what information<\/i> they are exposed to that affects offline communication during medical consultations. Our findings have important implications for research and practice on patient-provider communication in an eHealth era.\n","Abstract Body: In multiracial/cultural Singapore, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is considered part of Chinese cultural heritage and is popular among ethnic Chinese and other communities given its historical and cultural significance (Ng, 2016). Since 2004, all acupuncturists and TCM physicians in Singapore must be registered with the government and possess practicing certificates (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2018). By 2018, there were 3,004 registered TCM physicians and 252 acupuncturists (Ministry of Health Singapore, 2019a, 2019b). However, the co-existence of biomedicine and TCM is not without tensions. Patients tend to hide TCM use particularly from biomedical doctors (Chang & Basnyat, 2015). The majority of western-trained practitioners have never referred patients for TCM because of personal lack of TCM knowledge and seeing no need for integrative medicine (Wong, Toh, & Kong, 2010), and TCM physicians report feeling marginalized in Singapore’s medical system and receiving insufficient recognition from biomedical professionals, patients, and the state (Chang & Lim, 2019).<br /><br />Extant literature suggests a sometimes dichotomous separation of biomedicine and TCM. Metaphors of reductionism versus holism have been used to describe the distinctions between biomedicine and TCM (Paterson, & Britten, 2008). The dichotomy extends from different philosophies and ways of knowing to social standings of providers and modes of provider-patient communication (Schreiber, 2005). Ho and Bylund (2008) indicated that while many studies have used “holism” to describe TCM, which connotes patient-centered care and customized medical experiences, holism actually manifests itself in a variety of ways in the actual practice of and communication about TCM. We adopt Ho and Bylund’s framework that separates the ways of knowing (i.e., the models of health), from the provider-patient relationship (i.e., the models of interaction) to examine TCM physicians’ interpretations of holism in Singapore. We argue that a separate examination of the models of health and the models of interaction is necessary to reveal the multidimensional meanings and operations of holism in Chinese medicine.<br /><br />Twenty-two registered TCM physicians in Singapore were interviewed using semi-structured guides. Participants were diverse in their gender, age, workplace, and years of experience in TCM. A theory-led thematic analysis was performed to extract meanings around the research questions. All authors performed data coding and took part in theme identification to establish and confirm reliability of the results.<br /><br />Three meta-themes emerged from the interview data (Table 1). “Different paths but similar goal” reveals that although TCM and biomedicine may differ in terms of the ways of knowing and ways to explain to patients about their illness, there is also an acceptance that TCM and biomedicine are similar in the same goal to treat and cure the patient. “Integration of holism-science” illustrates that while TCM emphasizes mind-body balance and the connection with environmental factors, it also acknowledges science in its operations, which is reflected in how illness and diseases are diagnosed in TCM. The focuses on symptoms, prior history and lifestyle, and specific organs that may be the root cause of the illness are similar to the biomedical emphasis on science. “Experiencing holistic healthcare” challenges the idea of holism as respecting the autonomy of patients, trust, communication, patient-centeredness, and time. To the extent that patients have options to choose their preferences, they are still expected to trust and comply with the TCM practitioner’s recommendations.<br /><br />In conclusion, holism has become an umbrella term used to encompass anything non-reductionist, and such often spelled as “wholism” to emphasize the connections to the word, “whole” (Shroff, 2011). The TCM practitioners’ reference to an alternative idea of holism as an underlying principle that in practice also combines reductionism, however, speaks to the notion of a TCM-form of holism that is different from Western concepts of “wholism.”\n","Abstract Body: Incidence and prevalence rates of chronic diseases have increased in recent years in China in line with global trends. It was recently estimated that 75% of people in China aged 60 years and over have at least one chronic disease (Wang et al. 2019). Although the challenges posed by chronic diseases in China are similar to those being faced in other countries the country faces unique challenges. China's official health care system involves a hybrid structure that integrates Western Medicine (WM) and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Although WM in China draws on common principles of biomedicine, the way in which it is practiced reflects its position within its social and cultural context. Little is known about how patients with chronic diseases communicate with their WM doctors in China. It has been argued elsewhere that the nature and content of doctor-patient communication differs in situations in which individuals are living with long-term chronic diseases compared to those with acute illnesses or injuries. This study reports on the findings of an empirical study of communication between WM doctors and patients with chronic gastritis in one outpatient clinic at a specialist hospital in a province in eastern China.<br />Thirty-nine patients (16 male and 23 female) were recruited for this study. The mean age of the patients was 62.5 (SD = 9). Participants were relatively homogenous in ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Three specialist WM doctors (gastroenterologists) (2 female, 1 male) also participated in the study. All participants were native speakers of Mandarin Chinese.<br />Thirty-nine consultations were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim in Mandarin Chinese. These transcripts were then coded in Nvivo 11 Pro using the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). RIAS has been used extensively in health communication research in English (e.g. Roter et al., 1999; Roter and Larson, 2002) but, at the time of writing, this was the first time the system had been used on (untranslated) Chinese data. Findings were then translated into English for dissemination.<br />Findings of the study indicate that consultations between doctors and patients were short in terms of duration (average length of consultation was three minutes with standard deviation of 1.8) and that interactions were primarily focused on instrumental communication and management of therapeutic regimens. There was limited evidence of affective communication or discussion of emotional or social factors related to the patient’s health.<br />This study contributes quantitative and qualitative data from China data to international studies of health communication and chronic disease. Further analysis of the data and cross-cultural comparisons suggest some important similarities across groups in terms of how patient’s with chronic diseases communicate about their health and care needs and develop their understanding of their needs through conversations with doctors. The study also makes an important contribution to the ongoing development of health communication studies that analyse first and native languages rather than relying on the translation of data into English. Using RIAS on Chinese data therefore makes a methodological contribution to the field.<br /><br />References:<br />Roter, D. L. (2010).

In this grant funded, pilot study of first year medical students in an allopathic (M.D.) and an osteopathic (D.O.) medical school in the eastern United States, we used interpretive phenomenology to access students’ experiences of the dynamic push-pull between competency and compassion—paying attention to their narratives of self and profession. Twenty three students participated in multiple, extended, open-ended interviews during their first and second semesters of medical school. Preliminary review suggests two non-summative themes to develop further: temporal adjustment and humility. We speak to the possibility of those themes to provide insight on the communicative possibilities for fortifying, rather than undermining, the bridge between physician competence and compassion.\n","Abstract Body: Family involvement in medical decision making is an important factor that influences information exchange and decision making in health communication. Research in the Asia-Pacific region suggests that preferences for family involvement in medical decision making may depend on demographics, culture value orientations, and patient attitudes. However, to date, an examination of these issues in European countries is missing.<br />With total sample of <i>N<\/i> = 2,126 in four European countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Netherlands) we examined whether demographics, cultural value orientations, and personal attitudes were predictors of the preference for family involvement.<br />Independent patients as well as singles were less likely to prefer family involvement in all four countries more, while other demographics and personal attitudes appeared to be less relevant. High interdependents in all countries want more family involvement.  These results point to the importance of health providers considering their patients’ individual cultural values when issues of family involvement arise.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Chronic pain is debilitating, complex condition. Ethnomedical systems like Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine practiced in the South Asian subcontinent, views disease as a disequilibrium of the individual, nature, and the environment, and is based on core concepts of Ayurvedic nosology of <i>dosha <\/i>(<i>vata, pitta<\/i>, and <i>kapha<\/i>, regulating principles of physiological and pathophysiological processes) and <i>guna<\/i> principles (<i>sattva, rajas, tamas<\/i>, for psychomental regulation), yet little is understood about its conceptualization of the environment in tailoring chronic pain management approaches. This qualitatively grounded case study conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews of Ayurvedic physicians from India who had completed a recognized medical degree in Ayurvedic medicine through purposive and snowball sampling, the researcher’s professional network, a prominent Indian center of Ayurvedic education and training, and public searches (N=11). The findings present how, as an ethnomedical knowledge framework employing a whole system approach, Ayurveda’s approach as described by the Ayurvedic physicians in relationship with the environment and exemplifies the unique nature of the individual’s relationship with the environment as grounded in universal principles. This approach offers a significant entry point toward integrating principles of psycho-cognitive-social-physiological balance and environmental sustainability, plant-based preparations and diet, and seasonal and biological rhythms with human health and well-being as it applies to the management of chronic pain.\n","Abstract Body: Destigmatization is mandatory to alleviate stigma’s detrimental impact on the lives of people with a mental illness. Drawing from framing theory, a between-subjects posttest-only online experiment was used to investigate the effectiveness of three destigmatizing counterframing strategies. Participants read a text that either negated stigmatizing ideas (i.e., deframing), introduced a destigmatizing biomedical frame (i.e., reframing), or combined both strategies. Linear regression analyses indicate that biomedical reframing is ineffective in reducing stigma. However, combining it with deframing markedly increased its destigmatizing effectiveness. Deframing was also an effective destigmatizing strategy by itself, whereas the literature had predicted a backfire effect. The analyses also concluded that deframing and the combination of both counterframing strategies can be safely used in population-level campaigns, as they do not elicit negative effects for people with a personal history of mental illness, nor for those currently experiencing higher levels of depressive symptoms\n","Abstract Body: This study seeks to examine how pre-existing attitudes toward a phenomenon might alter the indirect media effects posited in the influence of presumed media influence (IPMI) model on another closely related phenomenon. Specifically, this study tests how pre-existing attitude toward genetically-modified (GM) food will moderate the indirect media effects on people’s intention to consume nano-enabled food in Singapore. The results of a nationally representative survey with 1,000 respondents revealed that pre-existing attitudes toward GM food (favorable vs. neutral vs. unfavorable) influenced the relationships among variables in the IPMI model in different ways. The findings indicate that there are nuances in the way people with different pre-existing attitudes toward a similar phenomenon process information about another similar phenomenon. In sum, existing IPMI effects varied according to people’s attitude toward a preceding and closely-related phenomenon. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: During the summer of 2018, a measles outbreak hit Europe, resulting in infections and deaths among children and adults. Reports link the outbreak to increasing vaccine resistance fueled in part by anti-vaccine messages propagated on social media. This study examines childhood vaccination themes on Twitter using semantic network analysis. Results showed the most prominent theme was HPV vaccination as a disease preventative. The MMR-autism link was the second biggest theme to emerge, followed by the theme of rising MMR rates in France and their connection to weakened herd immunity. We found Twitter centered childhood vaccine discussion on limited concepts that reflected both popular vaccine topics and current issues. These results suggest that social media may be an effective place to promote childhood vaccines.\n","Abstract Body: Consulting the extend parallel processing model, the current study examined social media coverage of the HPV vaccine in China. We conducted content analysis of 1,221 messages posted in the recent one year and a half and found that social media demonstrated an unbalanced and inadequate framework in portraying the HPV vaccine. It is suggested that efficacy of the HPV vaccination is much more emphasized than susceptibility and severity of HPV infection with a recommending tone for the public. Meanwhile, from a gender perspective we found that social media coverage showed the tendency of medical colonialism. Women’s responsibility for preventing the sexually transmitted diseases is much more highlighted than the men’s, which raises concerns about gender inequality on social media.\n","Abstract Body: The use of social media in health promotion in Singapore is fairly novel. Earlier health promotion in Singapore has mainly used mass media (e.g., newspaper, TV, radio) or community outreach. With the increasing popularity of Facebook by organizations, recent health promotions have utilized social media. This study draws on health behavior theory, dialogic theory in public relations, and persuasive communications theory to analyze health promotion social media postings and their influence on online audience engagement. A content analysis of 1481 social media postings by Health Promotion Board in Singapore from 2016 to 2018 was performed. Results showed higher prevalence of perceived susceptibility, as well as provision of useful information. These two constructs were also positive predictors of online audience engagement through the measurement of Facebook retweet and emotional response. However, generation of return visit was shown to be a negative predictor of the above. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The underrepresentation of African American (AA) participants in medical research perpetuates health disparities for this population. We conducted open-ended phone interviews with 50 AA adults from Philadelphia who had completed their participation in a glaucoma genetic study that included complimentary ophthalmic screenings. Transcript analysis assessed how this care-based recruitment program – promoted through targeted messaging and community channels – influenced decisions to participate in research despite perceived risks. Respondents reported access to health services and the potential to help others as primary motivators in their decision to participate. For the one-third of participants who explicitly reported reservations about research due to past or current mistreatment of AAs, helping others was a salient reason for participating. Future campaigns aiming to recruit AA research participants should incorporate community partners, combine enrollment opportunities with access to health services, and emphasize the potential for new research to mitigate health disparities.\n","Abstract Body: Although morality is a defining aspect of humans, researchers have just begun to systematically study how moral appeals would impact persuasiveness. Existing research often employs single-message designs, raising the concern for case-category confounding. To address this gap, I leveraged crowdsourcing to scale a relatively large pool of 122 textual anti-vaping messages (TAVMs) and 90 pictorial anti-smoking messages (PSAMs) along the care, purity and liberty moral dimensions. In a multiple-message randomized experiment, care and purity appeals increased perceived effectiveness (PE). Evidence also supported the moral matching hypothesis predicting PE in the case of care PASMs but not for other types of moral appeals. This study is the first to address visual moral appeals. Results suggest that health campaign designers eager to harness the power of visual-saturated social media should consider care-based moral appeals in their campaigns.\n","Abstract Body: Despite considerable research touting the effectiveness of entertainment media content in enhancing health knowledge (i.e., entertainment-education), the influence of cognition on viewer appreciation of entertainment content for educational purposes remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of explicit health information via video captioning on two areas of cognitive load during a television medical drama episode: (a) narrative processing and (b) embedded health information processing. A pretest-posttest (1-week interval) controlled lab experiment revealed that the captions increased cognitive load relevant to health information processing, facilitating retention and recall of health-related knowledge. Neither cognitive load for narrative processing nor narrative transportation differed between the captioned video and the uncaptioned video. The findings suggest discrete but complementary areas of cognition for narrative processing and health information processing and provide implications for advancing entertainment-education.\n","Abstract Body: Scholars have long investigated fear appeals to improve their effectiveness and persuasiveness, yet we lack understanding regarding the role of cultural orientation in relation to fear appeals. In the current study, we investigate how individual self-construal influences responses to culturally reflected fear appeals in the context of smoking cessation. Using a 2 (Reference type: self-reference versus other-reference) x 2 (Smoking cessation program: individual program versus group program) experimental design, the study found that self-construal moderated the effects of reference type on perceived threat and perceived threat to freedom. In addition, the main effects of self-construal on perceived threat to freedom and self-efficacy were observed. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed. <br />\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: People’s comfort with and acceptability of artificial intelligence (AI) instantiations is a topic that has received little systematic study. This is surprising given the topic’s relevance to the design, deployment and even regulation of AI systems. To help fill in our knowledge base, we conducted a mixed methods analysis based on a survey of a representative sample of the U.S. population (N=2,254). Results show that there are two distinct social dimensions to comfort with AI: as a peer and as a superior. For both dimensions, personality factors are strongly associated with acceptance of AI in various roles. A strong association was also found with measures of locus of control (the higher a respondent’s internal locus of control, the less comfortable they were with AI, particularly in a position of power) and with robot phobia (particularly with AI as a peer). Demographic factors were also significantly linked to the dependent variables, with female and older respondents expressing less comfort with the idea of AI agents in various roles. Experiential factors were also significant predictors of attitudes towards AI. To complement our statistical approach, we conducted a qualitative analysis of comments collected from respondents. We conclude by exploring implications of our research for AI acceptability in society.\n","Abstract Body: Using data from 28 countries, this study examines factors influencing public attitude towards the use of AI/Robot. Its multilevel SEM analysis finds several factors at the individual level including Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy predict public acceptance of AI/Robot. Although such country-level factors as techno-socio environment do not directly influence public receptivity of AI/Robot, they do have significant effects on Perceived threat of job loss due to AI/Robot, and Digital technology efficacy. Findings indicate that techno-socio environment factors influence people’s perceptions of AI and robotic technologies and their confidence in their digital skills.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Devices and software that perform the role of communicator, referred to as communicative technologies, are becoming an integral means through which people encounter artificial intelligence (AI) in daily life. This research examines people’s knowledge and perceptions of artificial intelligence, generally, and within the context of communicative AI technologies, specifically voice-based AI assistants (e.g., Apple’s Siri) and news-writing software (e.g., Automated Insights’ Wordsmith). Findings based on 81 interviews across two research projects demonstrate that while most people are familiar with the term “artificial intelligence,” they report knowing little about AI and struggle to define it. Among scholars, AI has no singular conceptualization and, similarly, participants’ definitions of AI are not uniform. The result is that people’s classification of communicative technologies as AI also varies: some people may consider a specific technology to be AI, while others do not. Implications for Human-Machine Communication (HMC) research are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Recommender agents, artificially intelligent recommender systems that demonstrate anthropomorphic cues, are widely available online to provide consumers with individually tailored recommendations. Nevertheless, little is known about the effect of their anthropomorphic cues on users’ resistance to both the system and recommendations. Moreover, individually tailored recommendations require users to proactively or reactively disclose information for receiving customized or personalized recommendations, which can trigger users’ resistance to the platform and the recommendations. Accordingly, this study examined the extent to which recommender systems’ anthropomorphic cues and the type of recommendations provided (customized and personalized) influenced online users’ perceptions of control, trustworthiness, and the risk of using the platform. The study assessed how these perceptions, in turn, influence users’ adherence to the recommendations. An online experiment among online users (N = 266) with recommender agents and web recommender platforms that provided customized or personalized restaurant recommendations was conducted. The results of the experiment entail that when recommendations are customized, as compared to personalized, users are less likely to demonstrate resistance and are more likely to adhere to the recommendations provided. Furthermore, the study’s findings suggest that these effects are amplified for recommender agents, demonstrating anthropomorphic cues, in contrast to traditional systems as web recommender platforms.\n","Abstract Body: Human-machine communication is a growing field which incorporates research from a wide variety of disciplines and specialities. With the changing relationship between people and machines, the study of trust has become central. This study conducted a co-citation network analysis to detect key ideas in the literature of trust and human-machine communication, both of which are multidimensional and multidisciplinary concepts. From a sample of 276 articles, the analysis revealed a co-citation subgraph of 618 documents consisting of 7 communities of research. The findings show that scholarly communities focused on human-automation interaction, human-robot interaction, and cognitive factors dominate the current discussion of trust in human-machine communication. We also find a smaller community in e-commerce, which includes attitudinal and affective factors. The remaining communities are highly specialised research areas that reveal the broad interest on trust in human-machine communication. Finally, we discuss opportunities for the discovered research communities to collaborate and advance the study of human-communication.\n","Abstract Body: Chatbots have been applied by brands for providing customer care online, but most experiences are at an early stage. Our research sets out to explore which advantages and disadvantages chatbots can bring to brands when used in customer care by studying two companies in Portugal. These exploratory comparative case studies where explored with qualitative methods, namely in-depth interviews with relevant agents.<br />We concluded that chatbots afford positive results for brands, such as reducing customer care costs and enhancing proximity by being constantly available and responding promptly, but they also pose risks. They start out with an initial database of matches between keywords, questions and answers and need interaction to evolve and improve. During this initial stage, they often afford negative brand experiences and require constant human monitoring and curating. However, in a maturity stage, they can enhance performance and satisfaction of customer care, motivate shopping by impulse and nurture loyalty.\n","Abstract Body: This project explores the extent to which audiences perceive the nature of news article authorship when they assess news bias and credibility. News products today are increasingly likely to be written by artificial intelligence (AI) programs. This phenomenon raises the possibility that news about politics could be written by an AI program rather than a human author. The present study examines the extent to which people attribute the potential for bias to an AI author. Such attributions, or their absence, can affect the hostile media phenomenon and perceptions of news credibility.\n","Abstract Body: The recent crashes of two Boeing 737 MAX airplanes has highlighted the importance of communication in the design of safety-critical systems. Both accidents were a result of a system which malfunctioned but, critically, did not communicate to the human pilots what it was doing. The incidents serve as a grave reminder of what happens when communication takes a backseat in the design process. This paper highlights some of the key concepts that define human-machine communication centered design and how they may be employed to prevent future tragedies in aviation and other high-consequence industries.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Artificial intelligence permeated our lives in various ways, such as self-driven cars and personal AI assistants (Adams, 2017). As people have begun to have more interests in artificial intelligence, they have both expectations and concerns on how technology will impact our society (Shermer, 2017). One reason for the concern is that people believe AI will outperform humans, which is not unfounded misunderstanding because there have been cases that showed computers surpassing human capacities, such as AlphaGo, an AI GO player, defeating human Go champions (Curran, Sun & Hong, 2019). However, while it is expected that AI can show better performances that require mathematical calculations, whether AI can be creative and create artistic products, are still questionable. Even though it is challenging, there have been efforts to understand human creativity in order to create creative AI (Boden, 1998).<br />To find whether AI can be creative, it should be considered whether a creative product made by AI can be deemed as an artwork. Coeckelbergh (2017) answered this question by saying that it should be considered as an art based on both subjective and objective approaches. He argued that if there are objective criteria to be fulfilled to be called art, then AI can easily produce products that meet those criteria. On the other hand, if the definition of art is subjective, then everything, including AI-created products, has an equal chance to become artwork. However, even though it is possible to “define” AI-created works as art, whether people really “appreciate” them as art is a different question.<br />Even though we do not have a clear answer regarding how we should see AI being creative, there are already AI programs that create their own works, including music-creating AI. Aiva is a music-composing artificial intelligence that has its own copyrighted soundtracks (Hewahi, AlSaigal, & AlJanahi, 2019). Aiva started from composing classical music, but now it can compose different genres of music such as pop, rock, cinematic, and jazz.<br />AI and Music<br />The effort to create an AI that plays music began even before the term “artificial intelligence” was familiar to the public (Meehan, 1979; Roads, 1980; Roads, 1985), and the field has grown enough to be called Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM) (Camurri, 1990). It is because artificial intelligence is expected to influence music in terms of not only composing, but also performance and even music education (Zulić, 2019). However, much AI music research has focused on AI's musical cognition, creating AI that can compose music, or even its legal issue (Bharucha & Olney, 1989; Longuet-Higgins, 1994; Sturm, Iglesias, Ben-Tal, Miron, & Gómez, 2019; Stere & Trăusan-Matu, 2017). The purpose of AI music study is not only limited to creating music-composing AI but also AI that can listen to music and interact with performers simultaneously (Baird, Blevins, & Zahler, 1993). While we can see AI-created music is getting ready to be sent, it is not clear if receivers are also ready. However, there has been a lack of studies on how people see music composed by AI.<br />Now it is clear that the intrusion of AI in music composing is inevitable, so artists should choose their stance between thinking AI as a threatening enemy or a future collaborator (Zulić, 2019). However, what is more important is the investigation of whether people are willing to use AI-created music because their attitudes will influence the AI-music industry. Aiva is a product that has emerged from these endeavors to create music-composing AI that provides evidence that AI can write music pieces on behalf of human composers. The way Aiva creates music is by analyzing 30,000 music scores out in the world and then creating its own music pieces based on its interpretation using a mathematical model (Barreau, 2018). Some people may say that this is not purely creative since it is more of an imitation of previous music pieces. However, it should be acknowledged that people also learn to make something unique by imitating previous works (Turkle, 2005; Jackson, 2017). Ready or not, Aiva has already prepared AI music, so now, the question is whether people will accept it. However, empirical research about the perception of AI-created music is yet insufficient.<br />Perception of creative work done by AI<br />There have been many efforts to create creative AI in diverse fields. First, there have been efforts to create AI that create images. Google’s DeepDream creates hallucinogenic images with its convolutional neural network (Marzano & Novembre, 2017). Creative Adversarial Networks (CAN) is another image-creating AI program that creates art by “maximizing deviation from established styles and minimizing deviation from art distribution” (Elgammal, Liu, Elhoseiny, & Mazzone, 2017, p. 2). Artificial intelligence is also challenging the movie industry. <i>Sunspring<\/i> is a short movie based on a script by an AI program using neural networks and <i>Zone out<\/i> is a movie directed by an AI program (Furness, 2016; Goode; 2018). Moreover, there was a Google AI project to create an AI program that writes poetry (Gibbs, 2016). Therefore, it is expected that AI will also be deployed in fields that require creativity, and what we now have to know is how people differentiate AI artworks from human-created ones.<br />How people differentiate artworks created by AI compared to human-created ones has been empirically studied, mostly using visual artworks, particularly graphic images. Multiple experimental studies were conducted to test how people perceive AI-created artworks, and it is found that people's perception of AI art has a positive relationship with their belief about the ability of AI to be creative (Chamberlain, Mullin, Scheerlinck, & Wagemans, 2018; Hong & Curran, 2019). These results indicate that the evaluation of artworks is rather a biased procedure that can easily be swayed by schema about AIs and the creativity people have. It can be inferred from these previous studies that how people perceive AI-created music would be based on their perceptions of AI's ability to be creative. Unless there is a significant difference between the process of visual stimulus and auditory stimulus, people with the belief that AI can be creative will appreciate music composed by AI more.<br />Machine Heuristics and Music Genre Schema<br />As mentioned above, the evaluation of AI-composed music seems to be influenced by previous knowledge and attitudes about artificial intelligence and music. People have certain expectations of machines. For instance, AI is expected to be more just and trustworthy than humans are, a belief called machine heuristics (Sundar & Kim, 2019). A previous study found that people tend to think AI is less autonomous than humans (Hong & Williams, 2019). This perception may influence the evaluation of AI-created music since people who think this will also think that music is not purely created by AI and will, as a result, appreciate the works less.<br />Also, if people think creativity is an innate characteristic that only belongs to humans, then AI-composed music—which is another form of creative performance—would be devalued because they may disqualify AI as a composer. Even though a machine’s performance is indistinguishable compared to that of humans, there are people who still think that a machine’s performance is not “humanlike” (McCarthy, 2007). Because people distinguish AI from humans by having various machine heuristics, how people evaluate composed music will also show differences based on who they think the composer is. It is expected that even the same musical composition will receive lower ratings when it is revealed to be created by artificial intelligence.<br />When listening to AI musical numbers, machine heuristics would not be the only factor that influences the evaluation: people’s understanding of the music genre would be another factor. Since listening to music is a mental effort, schema has been used to inquire about music perceptions (Shevy, 2008; Parncutt, 1998). Similarly, one experimental study found that males tend to prefer female website owners with a classical background in music while females find male website owners with a background in heavy metal music more attractive (Yang & Li, 2013). Furthermore, classical music is often regarded as part of highbrow culture, intimating that it is less digestible to the general public (Peterson & Kern, 1996; Deihl, Schneider, & Petress, 1983). This dissimilar perception coming from the music genre can moderate the relationship between the identities of music composers and the appreciation of their music pieces. Thus, it is presumed that how people will react to music would differ based on its genre; people might appreciate human-composed music over AI-created music when they believe the genre is more inimitable than other genres.<br />From previous studies regarding AI, creativity, and music, it can be anticipated that music appreciation may differ based on the identity of the composers (AI vs. human) and the genre of the music; the interaction effect between the two factors is expected. Also, people’s beliefs and attitudes toward creative AI will influence the evaluation of AI music pieces. While there has been a growth in the AIM field, social science research with empirical data has not been conducted enough. Therefore, the understanding of the relationships between the factors mentioned—through a rigorously designed experiment—is expected to contribute to the development of AI music composition in terms of academia and industry.<br /><i>H1<\/i>. There is a positive relationship between the belief that AI can be creative and the evaluation of AI-composed music.<br /><i>H2<\/i>. People will appreciate music more when they know it as human-composed compared to when they know it as AI-composed.<br /><i>RQ1<\/i>. Would there be a relationship between the genre of AI music and the appreciation of the music?<br /><i>RQ2<\/i>. Would there be an interaction effect between the genre of music and the identity of the composer?<br />Methods<br />To test the hypotheses, a 2x3 experiment was designed and conducted, where both the identity of composers (AI vs. human) as well as the genre of the music (electronic dance music vs. rock vs. classical) were different. The dependent variable for this study is how well the music is composed. Students who are taking communication courses will be recruited providing extra credits as compensation.<br />Participants who agree to participate in the study will be put into several groups of five people. All groups will be divided into two types, experimental group and control group. Each group will be put into a room and listen to music composed by AI. For experimental groups, the composer of the music, AI, will be disclosed, whereas the composer will be kept undisclosed for control groups. To measure their expectations about the given genre of music and composer type, they will be asked to participate in a music evaluation survey that measures craftsmanship, originality/creativity, and aesthetic value (Webster & Hickey, 2010) based on their understanding of three genres (classical music, rock, and EDM) before listening to music. Then, they will have two opportunities to listen to music: 1) before the survey while their eyes closed and 2) during the survey. While they listen to music for the second time, they will be asked to answer the music evaluation survey with the same questions before. This process will be repeated for the other two genres of music. The order of genres of music will be randomized. After the experiment, people will be debriefed, including the actual identity of composers.<br />Future plan<br />At the time of submission, the music that will be used in the experiment and scales to measure participants’ evaluation of given music pieces are prepared. An IRB approval and recruiting process is needed. Also, possible covariates that can influence the analysis are still being considered. It is expected that the findings of this study will contribute to the understanding of creative performances of artificial intelligence.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reference<br />Adams.

To date there has been little research into how AI’s role in human-human communication affects interpersonal dynamics. Here we focus on three important processes that may be affected by AI-MC: language production, person perception and task performance. In this study, we examine how integrating AI in the form of suggested text responses (Google’s smart replies) into a text-based referential communication task influence these three aspects of interaction. We draw on the Interactive Alignment Model (Pickering & Garrod, 2013) and hypothesize that smart replies will affect positivity of both the director and matcher’s language in a conversation, and in turn this positivity will affect impression formation and self-evaluations.\n","Abstract Body: In this extended abstract, we adopt glitch studies as a conceptual lens to study user interactions with smart speakers. We rely on a survey of 369 smart speaker users in the United Kingdom and focus on the sub-group of Amazon Echo users. The results reveal four types of glitches that Amazon Echo users encounter: Amazon Echo randomly starting to talk or carry out unexpected activities, Amazon Echo misinterpreting the user, technical issues related to connectivity, and violation of social and contextual norms. The extended abstract is embedded into the broader literature on privacy and smart speakers as well as glitch studies, contributing to the emerging domain of human-machine communication.\n","Abstract Body: To navigate in the deluge of information, consumers may rely on recommendations while shopping. By using their digital footprints, artificial intelligence (AI) can recommend products to its users. The personalized curation service may enhance the user’s shopping experience. However, they may be reluctant to use the service as it requires their private information. By using the privacy-calculus model, this research investigates the tradeoff between the perceived benefits and risks of the curation service in the context AI speakers. Because an AI speaker may be anthropomorphized as a human-like agent according to Computers Are Social Actors paradigm, this research considered the effect of perceived intimacy and personification of the AI speaker on the degree of customization. The revised model of this study revealed that the user’s perception of the AI speaker influenced their evaluation of its curation service. Those who personified or were intimate with the AI speaker perceived the curation service to personalized. In addition, the results indicate that the perceived level of customization of the AI-based curation services can emphasize the benefits while reducing the risks of using the services. For example, the perceived benefit of enjoyment demonstrates that the curation service can provide a hedonic satisfaction to the users. They may find the personalized recommendation to be intriguing, which increases their willingness to continue using the curation service. Regarding the perceived risks, it can be inferred that the users are less likely to consider the disclosure of their personal information as the violation of privacy when it is used to provide an effective curation service, which caters specifically to them. Thus, the developers an AI-based curation service need to focus on providing a personal and customized service as well as making the AI speakers to be more anthropomorphizable.\n","Abstract Body: This multi-method study systematically investigate the effect of certain phoneme on automatic robot personality perception. Informed by both the CASA (Computer are Social Actors) paradigm as well as recent advances in psycholinguistic research, this innovative study is the first one to test to what extent the phenomenon of sound symbolism will be observed in our social responses to robots. Two experiments (1 online, 1 in-lab) are designed to investigate the sound-shape, sound-personality association as well as the effect of sound-symbol congruity on users’ cognitive tasks performance.\n","Abstract Body: A recent progress made in the field of automated journalism could be the use of robotic news broadcaster, whose news reporting was first to air on Xinhua website, news agency in China. This study employs a 2 (anchor: robot or human) by 2 (types of news: soft or hard) between-subject design to investigate the differences of users' perceptions between robotic and human news anchor regarding hard or soft news, and examined differences in users' perceptive changes between two types of news broadcasted by the robotic/human anchor. Findings showed that robotic news anchor gained higher score on credibility with hard news and focus-ability with soft news, but lost watchability, likeability in soft news in comparison with human anchor. Moreover, the users’ perceptive change between soft and hard news in robot has less various and significant differences than that in human anchor. In further step, we will conduct a focus-group to figure out the reasons for differences and lead primary discussion on the social recognition of robotic news broadcaster, which would help to encourage a better understanding and development of human-robot interaction in this new era of automated journalism.\n","Abstract Body: The technological advancements in the field of social agent research is booming. Despite this, it is still difficult to identify which social characteristics social agents need to have for the user to interact with it as if it had a mind of its own. In the current ongoing project, we explore using a Theory of Mind task to answer this question.\n","Abstract Body: The ancient Greek myth of Pygmalion reveals human-beings’ long-lasting eager to achieve intimacy with their own artefacts. It comes into reality via the supernatural miracles in the narrative of myths, while people in the modern era tend to imagine the realisation of Pygmalion dream via science and technologies, from Robotic techniques to state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. The trajectory of AI empowered products development in form of social bots in past decades discloses a trend of the anthropomorphisation of artefacts, which maps the modern efforts of creating Pygmalion in diverse technological and social forms as well as a state of co-evolution between human and machine. Following Actor Network Theory and a grounded theory way of thinking, based on latest case studies, this paper aims to identify a holistic and up-to-date picture of the process of anthropomorphisation of social bots in achieving machinic simulations of intimacy, and argue that the existence of human is constructed through the social bots, while simultaneously being reconstructed to be posthumans.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Despite their rapid development, social robots still face difficulties for achieving smooth communication with humans, particularly when we consider interactions in an emotional context. To contribute in this quest for meaningful human-robot interaction (HRI), we present an interaction design framework focusing on children which introduces a multimodal programming model to parametrize the social robot's empathic responses according to type of emotional valence and intensity. This extended abstract presents an interaction sequence of five main steps between a child and a highly user-programmable social robot (SIMA robot), for five basic emotions and four mood/affective states. The goal of the model is that of parametrizing empathic emotional responses considering multimodal communication aspects in a simultaneous way, such as communication chronemics (e.g. time of the day, reaction time speed) and kinesics (e.g. amplitude of micro arm movements, body movement speed). Ultimately, through completion of the five stages, the model attempts to activate emotional self-awareness in the child and foster the start of an educational activity and/or game between the social robot and the child to help the child deal with his/her emotions. Considering the educational potential of the social robot in question, our model focuses on children (7 to 11 years old) because of their mastery of social and abstract-thinking skills, compared to younger children.\n","Abstract Body: In recent years, bullet screens have become extremely popular among young viewers in Japan and China. Bullet screens refer to anonymous and timeline-synchronized comments embedded in streaming videos on video sharing websites. Although research on bullet screen is emerging, a few have focused on the socio-psychological mechanism that helps understand the enjoyment of this unique meditated co-viewing experience. By reviewing the literature on in-person and mediated co-viewing, social presence, similarity attraction, and belongingness theory, the aim of this study is to provide a theoretical framework for viewers’ enjoyment of bullet-screen co-viewing from a socio-psychological perspective.\n","Abstract Body: This study aims to examine the effect of machine authorship and specialization cues on readers’ perception of news credibility. Previous findings are mixed when it comes to the effect of machine authorship. Also, whether people perceive the software that is labeled to be a specialist in a specific domain area (e.g., finance, earthquakes, sports) to be more credible than machines and humans who are purported to be non-specialized has not been explored in news context. A 2 (purported writer : machine vs human) × 2 (specialization of the writer: specialist vs non-specialist) × 2 (level of interpretation: low vs high) between-subjects experiment will be conducted to examine how machine authorship impacts the evaluation of the news when the specialization of the writer and the level of interpretation vary.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The cross-talks between artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and digital journalism, such as robot journalists and personalized news recommendation, have triggered controversies on how news professionals understand and response—either acceptance or resistance—to these digital initiatives. The present study applies the Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to inspect the human (journalist)-machine (AI applications) interaction, which is manifested by the extent to which news organizations alter its organizational structure (i.e., establishing new specialized taskforces or recruiting more technical specialists). The study focuses in Hong Kong, a wired city with a highly competitive media market. It uses a mixed-method approach: in-depth interviews with the senior managerial staffs plus a survey study of reporters, all from large marketing-dominating local news organizations. Linguistic analysis was used to analyze the interview scripts and linguistic features are retrieved to demonstrate the informants’ responses towards the digital initiatives. Results indicate that the news organizations are conservative towards AI technologies for the news production. Theory wise, the study contributes to ANT by explaining how disruptive technologies alter the practices and epistemologies of digital journalism. Methodologically, it extends the application of pragmatics and systemic functional linguistics in the study of digital journalism in the age of human-machine interaction.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Organizations continually strive to cut as much costs as possible to maximize profits. Due to a scarcity of labor as well as cost-saving, many organizations consider the possibilities of automation. One such example is the use of a computer-based receptionist, who is the first agent in the organization for visitors such as job interviewees. This study investigates how well four types of computer-based receptionists are received by visitors using the computers are social actors (CSCA) framework. The effect of the perceived degree of social presence in computer-based receptionists on relevant outcomes (i.e., perceived credibility, communication competence, source credibility) to organizational attraction is examined. Data from a total of 473 participants indicate that a text-based check-in system created the highest perceptions of social presence (i.e., copresence and psychological involvement) compared to (a) human receptionist on a monitor, (b) an avatar on a monitor, and (c) a holographic receptionist. The study also revealed that a check-in system had the highest means in all four outcomes and was significantly higher in perceived credibility as well as perceived communication competence. Findings and implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The development of artificial intelligence and robot technology has made human-computer interaction an important new research paradigm. In recent years, society has witnessed the rapid growth of intelligent robots, but the extent to which people accept them is an open question. This study’s purpose is to examine the acceptance of robots by people in Mainland China and Taiwan and how this might vary by a robot’s characteristics. The survey sampling process yielded 2,216 respondents (1,110 from Mainland China and 1,106 from Taiwan). The study found that the acceptance of robots in Mainland China is statistically significantly higher than in Taiwan. The acceptance levels of these two groups is influenced not only by individual traits, such as age, religious orientation, and personal technology competence, but also a robot’s features, such as its gender and functionality. Some within-culture differences are that the respondents’ gender affects the acceptance of robots for people in Taiwan, while household income affects the acceptance of robots for people in Mainland China. As to the gender of the robot, a genderless (“agender”) robot yields higher levels of acceptability in both samples when compared to either male- or female-gendered robots. The superiority of the robot’s function and the similarity between the robot and the human are significantly positively correlated with the social cognition of the robot. Although there are obvious limitations to the study, a cross-cultural comparison yields provocative results concerning the role of gender in designing – and ultimately living with –the domestic robot of the future.<br /><br />Keywords: Robot acceptability; personal traits; robot features; human-computer interaction<br />\n","Abstract Body: The advancement of artificial intelligence has allowed machine-generated content to be perceived as not only objective and trustworthy but also creative and transformative. Built upon prior literature on machine-generated news, this study seeks to expand the research scope to machine-generated art works in a cross-cultural context. This study combines machine learning approaches with online experiments and investigates how different genres of art works and different authorship cues influence participants’ open-ended responses to machine-generated works. Results suggest that while participants developed different topics and used different words when reacting to poems and paintings, the cues of machine agency versus human agency did not affect their discussion of the art works. Additionally, cultural value affects users’ description and perception of the art works. This study tests the explanatory power of machine heuristics and demonstrates the feasibility of combining machine learning with experimental methods in future human-machine communication research.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study employed an experiment to test how the valence of a situation affects the attribution of responsibility (praise vs. blame) between an artificial intelligent (AI) and a human actor. Relying on the theoretical frameworks of attribution theory and the Computers-Are-Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the design is framed around two conditions related to AI using a 2 (type of actor: human vs. AI-enabled self-driving car) x 2 (type of valence outcome: rescue vs. accident). After being randomly exposed to one of four fictitious news articles, participants (n=230) responded to an online questionnaire measuring their opinions about the human/AI actors involved and the relative level of responsibility they attribute to each. Results indicate that people attribute more responsibility to AI actors than human actors only in situations with a positive outcome. Also, people appear to view an AI-enabled actor similarly to how they perceive a human actor, which aligns with the CASA paradigm. Yet, this finding contradicts extant literature on the attribution of responsibility which predicts that subjects will positively evaluate human actors and negatively evaluate AI ones due to their respective levels of similarity. Instead, we propose how expectancy violation theory (EVT) better explains the results. Implications of the findings for theory development and application are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: EXTENDED ABSTRACT<br />The emergence of the Internet of Things, and social robots as a particular manifestation of it, have posed a layer of complexity to the double articulation of media as both material and symbolic artefacts (Haddon & Silverstone, 2000), given their agentic capacities that move a beyond supportive channel and act upon both child-machine interaction and machine-to-machine/data interactions (Guzman, 2018, ref anonymized, ref anonymized). In our study, we seek theoretical advancements to study this complexity of child-robotic toy interaction as a form of communication in families with children.  <br />This study reports on in-depth qualitative, mixed method data collected as part of a four-country project funded by the (anonymised). Theoretically, the conceptual framework that informs our analysis builds on and combines different concepts from media studies – namely the notions of domestication (Silverstone & Hirsh, 1992), communicative figurations (Couldry & Hepp, 2017), and human-machine communication (Guzman, 2018). In doing so, it foregrounds the meaning-making practices and the situated interactions between different actors, including children, parents, siblings and technological artefacts that constitute the process of appropriation of new technologies. Methodologically, our research was designed so as to move beyond the experimental toolkit of much research on children and robots. It presents an innovative qualitative approach that accounts for the mutual constitutive figurations between children, siblings, parents and media objects in a natural context, and that is sensitive to the spatial and temporal dimensions of the domestication of a robotic toy in the domestic context.<br /> <br /><i>Background literature and theoretical framework<\/i><br />The Domestication of Technology approach emerged in the Nineties within British media studies with the aim of addressing the question of how new ICTs are appropriated, given a place and rendered meaningful within the domestic environment. In this perspective, the ways in which media are incorporated and made meaningful is never fully pre-determined by the functionalities of the technology, nor by its discursive construction in commercial, media and social representations; rather, it is always situated in everyday life contexts and practices, and shaped by the social, cultural and power dimensions that characterise a specific context of use. The key negotiations through which a technology is attributed a meaningful place within the household revolve around its “appropriation” – namely, the negotiations that lead to its acquisition; its “objectification” – where it is physically located in the space; its “incorporation” – its integration within the set of daily practices and the temporal structures of family life; and its “conversion” – the process of identification through which users become emotionally attached to technologies, and technologies become tokens for self-expression (Silverstone & Hirsh, 1992). Each family then operates as a distinctive “communicative figuration” (Couldry & Hepp, 2017, p. 66), involving a specific “constellation of actors” who share common “relevance-frames” of action and communication, and who engage in a set of practices enabled by and dependent upon distinctive assemblages of media technologies. Ultimately, the question is how the family as a moral economy (Silverstone & Hirsh, 1992) – that is, a system of meanings, values, norms and power relations - adopts, while simultaneously adapting to, new media and how their everyday life practices are being transformed through such a mutual shaping.<br />While the domestication framework, at least in its introduction, was not designed to capture the complexity of human-machine interaction as a form of communication, we believe it can be extended to the study of the appropriation of a robotic toy in the domestic context. More specifically, the domestication approach combined with the notion of communicative figurations fits well with the current developments in human-machine communication for its focus on meaning-making practices and its understanding of domestication as a continuing, negotiated, even contested process of co-shaping and mutual adaptation (Suchman, 2011), that moves beyond a narrow focus on the initial phase of adoption. In a recent work, such a dynamic temporal framework for the domestication of robots was proposed. It identifies six phases of domestication before and after acquisition: expectation, encounter, adoption, adaptation, integration and identification (De Graaf, Ben Allouch, & van Dijk, 2018). These moments are neither sequential nor completed once and for all: on the contrary, technologies can be re-domesticated or de-domesticated (Haddon, 2004; Lie & Sørensen, 1996), either for the arrival of new ICTs or for the technology’s failure to fit in the pre-existing media ecology.<br />Situated within the theoretical frameworks presented above, this study pursues an in-depth understanding of how robotic toys are domesticated (and eventually, sometimes, de-domesticated) by families with young children in the context of their everyday life, accounting for 1) the different actors and their dynamic, mutual constitutive interactions 2) the family’s culture and 3) the daily practices in which family members engage through, around and with media.<br /> <br /><i>Methods<\/i><br />This study relied on an interpretative research design. Ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Boards of the participating universities was obtained prior to the data collection. The study took place in 2019 in (locations anonymized).  Families with at least one child aged 8-12 were eligible to participate. A total of 20 families volunteered to participate in the research. The research protocol relied on a combination of interviews, observations, and participatory activities led by children. The procedure of data collection spanned over a period of about four to six weeks, with two field visits of the families at home and smaller assignments for the parents as co-researchers in between these field visits.<br />During the field visit, each family was handed over an interactive toy robot, Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup>. Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> is a small robotic toy, controlled through an app for smartphone and tablet, and equipped with visual recognition software, which comes with a set of pre-programmed games and activities, but can also be coded by the child through the Code Lab. The researcher made sure that the Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> was successfully installed, explained and demonstrated to the participating parent and child. They were informed that they could keep the Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> robot as a gift to thank them for their participation in the study.  During the first field visit, we also administered in-depth interviews with parent and child. We interviewed parents about their opinions and expectations around digital play and their parental mediation practices. We chose a more interactive interview style to question children and invited them to accompany the researchers in a play tour showing their favourite toys and talking about how they play with them. After the first family visit, the researchers filled in a form noting down the technologies owned and used by different family members, the structure of the family, the location of the interview, the family context (parental education, career status, ethnicity/cultural background, observed socio-economic status) and any further notes relevant to the interpretation of the findings in their context.<br />Before we met a second time with the family, we engaged the parents as co-researchers, asking them to film their children’s interactions with Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> and share them with the researchers.<br />The second family visit took place 4-6 weeks later. During the second visit, we asked parents to share their and their children’s experiences with Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup>, whether and how it fitted the family’s temporal routines and media ecology, what they liked about their children playing with Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> and what they disliked. Parents were invited to discuss the video recordings, which served as interview prompts. The interview with children took the form of a co-creation activity through the Book Creator app, through which children re-constructed, in a narrative and multimodal form, their experiences with Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup>. This co-creation activity responded to both ethical and heuristic considerations. First, in line with the shift in children’s status within research as full social actors and participants that now characterises most studies with children (Christensen & Prout, 2002), the co-creation activity represented a way to design child-friendly methods and positive experiences for children (Warin, 2011). Second, this activity provided researchers with the opportunity to observe children while involved in play practices, instead of relying solely on their verbal accounts.<br />The timing of the two family visits was designed as a way to observe patterns of domestication of Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> in different family figurations beyond the novelty effect (Van den Bulck et al., 2016).<br />The collected data included transcriptions, visual data (videos, photos), and field notes. The first cycle of data analysis was open and exploratory in nature; the second cycle used the domestication framework to build our sensitising concepts, including <i>objectivation<\/i>, <i>incorporation<\/i> and <i>conversion<\/i> (Silverstone & Hirsh, 1992). Unfortunately, our research design did not allow us to make sense of the preceding <i>appropriation <\/i>phase (Silverstone & Hirsh, 1992) as the family’s encounter with and acquisition of Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> was mediated by the research study. However, the task assigned to children and their parents to interact with Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> over a period of about six weeks and film children’s play with Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup>, respectively, was general enough, we argue, to avoid directing and pre-determining the further domestication processes of objectivation, incorporation and conversion.<br /> <br /><i>Results and Discussion<\/i><br />Since the materiality of internet-connected things is double – comprising the physical materiality of the robot and the digital materiality of the app interface (Pink et al., 2016) – the <i>objectification<\/i> of Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> involved both its location within the domestic space and the identification of a suitable device to host the app. Both steps in its <i>objectification<\/i> were largely determined by technological constraints, with Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> requiring to be plugged in in order to function and with the app requiring specific hard- and software. The app was often installed on children’s own hand-me-down devices (see also Nouwen, 2018), e.g. when children had their own tablet or smartphone shared with their siblings. In other cases, instead, only a parent’s phone supported the app, for instance, because the child’s devices contained older and slower hard- and software which hampered the functioning of the Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> ecosystem that builds on robot-app interactions. In the latter cases, the child’s play was limited to the parent’s presence at home and could be interrupted by incoming calls and messages.<br />The <i>incorporation<\/i> of Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> into daily routines was constrained by the objectivation demands (see the above), the parental mediation practices seeking balancing screen time with physical and outside play, and the busy lives of children, who are involved in many extra-curricular activities. Non-structured leisure time was limited during school days, and Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> had to compete strongly with other media practices to gain children’s interest, especially online videos (e.g. YouTube) and video gaming (e.g. PlayStation). Over time, children’s engagement with Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> became less frequent and less intense, which hinted upon a gradual process of <i>de-domestication<\/i> once the novelty of Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> faded. However, the data suggested that there were moments of newly incited interest when there were visitors at home, with children being eager to showcase the Cozmo<sup>© <\/sup>to visiting friends and family. The overall progress of de-domestication thus knew peaks of temporarily re-domestication linked to performative acts towards actors who do not belong to the domestic context.<br />Such an incomplete <i>incorporation<\/i> is matched by a similar pattern of partial <i>conversion<\/i> or identification: while all the participating children developed an emotional attachment to Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> – also because the robot itself provokes the user to acknowledge its liveliness (Suchman, 2011), engage with its personality and take up a responsibility to nurture (authors), interact with and respond to the robot – Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> failed to become part of the family’s self-identity. The reasons, we suggest, build down to a complex interplay of factors, including the technological demands of the Cozmo<sup>©<\/sup> ecosystem, children’s favourite play practices privileging media activities that create immersed and constantly renewing experiences (such as YouTube and online interactive video games), parental mediation practices and motives favouring balance between the digital and non-digital, and creative, social and educated digital content, as well as broader socialization process with robotic toys still not being diffused among peers, especially in non-English-speaking countries.<br /> <br /><i>References<\/i><br />Christensen, P., & Prout, A.

We investigate whether children are pro-social towards robots to the same extent as to other humans, and whether this is influenced by the human-like appearance of the robot as well as children’s attributions of affective states to the robot. Results of a pilot study (Study I) as well as methods and hypotheses of the main study (Study II) are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: <br />This paper uses a communication-theoretical perspective to analyse the design process for Haru, an experimental robot platform created to use a range of affective affordances in communicating with people. The paper examines how the interdisciplinary team and Design Thinking methodology shaped Haru’s communication style from sociopsychological and cybernetic-semiotic perspectives, to be persuasive and to transmit precise information clearly. It then moves on to highlight some alternative ways to understand and further develop this robot as a communicative agent, drawing on phenomenological and sociocultural communication theories. Finally, the paper brings the various perspectives together, considering communication as encounter, story and dance to explore the future potential for this robot as a research platform for human-robot communication across various scenarios designed to investigate how to support long term interactions between humans and robots.\n","Abstract Body: Extending previous research on the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm and the human-to-human interaction script, this study examines the interpersonal impressions of a social robot evaluator versus a human evaluator in the context of performance evaluations. A between-subjects experiment was conducted to measure participants’ impressions of the credibility, task and social attractiveness, and social presence of a social robot or a human evaluator of their public speaking performances. Additionally, participants rated the competence of the feedback they received. Results demonstrated that both the robot and human evaluator were considered credible and task attractive. Only the human evaluator was considered as having social attraction and social presence. Moreover, both agents’ feedback was rated favorably. However, the human evaluator was rated significantly higher than the social robot on all dependent variables. Implications for the use of social robots in educational evaluator roles and for future HRI research are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: As self-disclosure is a central to the emergence of interpersonal relationships, scholars have focused on this communicative strategy in the context of child-robot interaction and relationship formation. However, little is known as to how the effects of a robot’s self-disclosure vary according to the disclosed information and the robot’s responsiveness in terms of question-asking. We therefore experimentally investigated the effects of a robot’s genuine versus apparent self-disclosure and question-asking on child-robot relationship formation. We collected self-report data from 293 children aged 7 to 11 years old, who interacted with the Nao robot at a science museum. The robot’s question-asking increased children’s trust in the robot as well as their belief in its cognitive perspective taking abilities. Genuine self-disclosure, in contrast, decreased children’s perception of the robot’s capacity to adopt their affective perspective. Children’s consideration of the robot as a social actor and a potential friend did not differ across conditions.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This research analyses the use of language-based strategies in initial human-chatbot interactions. Specifically, this study investigates the use of interactive uncertainty reduction strategies, namely self-disclosure and question asking, and expressions of empathy, humour, profanity and the use of appropriate language by the chatbot. This study aims to discover whether humans and a social chatbot communicate differently with a content analysis based on previously collected data from a longitudinal study, where 118 participants interacted seven times with chatbot Mitsuku. A randomly selected sample of 60 interactions was coded for the aforementioned variables. Results revealed that the participants self-disclosed more (intimately) and used more reciprocal self-disclosures, while the chatbot asked more questions, more reciprocal questions and more follow-up questions, expressed more similarity and humour. Our findings show that chatbots are programmed to gather information, by asking questions, to keep the conversation going, which elicits self-disclosure in human users. However, this is not reciprocated which may hinder human-chatbot relationship formation.\n","Abstract Body: This study extends emerging research on conversational agents by exploring how individual characteristics influence the willingness to interact with AI-based conversational agents as well as perceptions about these agents. Specifically, drawing on the diffusion of innovations framework this study investigates how socio-demographics – including age, gender, education level and socio-economic status – and attitudes towards technology are associated with the usage of chatbots in real-life settings. Results of a survey with a sample (N = 901) reflective of the Dutch adult population show that socio-demographics have little explanatory power in this process, except for education, while attitudes towards technology – namely privacy concerns, online self-efficacy and technology power usage – are important predictors of actual chatbot usage and downstream perceptions such, as satisfaction with the interaction, and attitudes towards the chatbot.\n","Abstract Body: With the rise of conversational agents, a new counterpart of conversations has emerged. Drawing on speech as an essential aspect of humanity, these agents appear to be psychologically highly relevant. Referring to the idea of media equation and the paradigm of <i>computer as social actors <\/i>(CASA), this study analyzes the transfer of social norm (politeness) to the interaction with conversational agents. In an experiment, participants interacted with Amazon Echo which feedbacked them either <i>politely<\/i>, <i>impolitely by blaming them for a failed interaction <\/i>or <i>Echo blamed itself<\/i>. Afterwards, participants evaluated the device twice: <i>directly at the device <\/i>and <i>at another computer<\/i>. Following the social norm of politeness, <i>impolite <\/i>conversational agents were evaluated significantly worse than <i>polite <\/i>ones or devices <i>blaming themselves<\/i>. Furthermore and in line with the socially desirable response bias, evaluations given directly to the device were significantly more positive than those given at the computer. In sum, conversational agents seem to elicit social norms with findings supporting the importance of underlying socio-psychological processes.\n","Abstract Body: Businesses use artificial intelligence[A1] -powered chatbots as a digital marketing channel to reach their target audiences more effectively. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to examine whether consumer perceptions vary based on a chatbot’s gender and type of self-disclosure. 2 (agent’s gender: male/female) × 2 (type of self-disclosure: factual/emotional) between-subjects design was used. Analysis of covariance was conducted with subjects’ gender as a covariate. Gender and type of self-disclosure had interaction effects on consumer perceptions of chatbots. Specifically, male chatbots who engaged in factual rather than emotional self-disclosure were perceived to be more attractive and possess greater expertise. [A2] In addition, female chatbots who engaged in emotional rather than factual self-disclosure were perceived to have a stronger social presence. Gender stereotypes that operate in offline interpersonal interactions were also observed in human-chatbot interactions. In other words, chatbots who engaged in self-disclosure behaviors that were consistent with stereotypical norms for their gender were perceived more favorably. The present findings enhance our understanding of chatbots as communication tools and offer practical suggestions to enhance their effectiveness.<br /> <br /><i>Keywords<\/i>:[A3]  Artificial intelligence[A4] , Chatbot, Self-Disclosure, Gender effect<br /><br /> [A1]Since this abbreviation is not repeated a second time in the abstract, I have deleted it.<br /><br /> [A2]The phrasing of this sentence was problematic.

Unlike the user experience of interacting with previous generations of communication systems, users today frequently engage in “conversations” with chatbots and digital assistants using natural language. Such a change presents a new challenge to online self-disclosure and privacy protection research. When prompted to provide personal information by a chatbot, for example, what factors might affect a user’s self-disclosure behavior? This study examines the effects of subtle social cues embedded in a chatbot on the human communicator’s willingness to disclose personal information and how human users’ dispositional and context-specific trust would influence the process. In an online experiment, I manipulated the names (explicit social cue: “Sam”; implicit social cue: “Assistant No.1”; no social cue: “Chatbot”) of a health advice chatbot. Participants’ target specific trust (toward the chatbot), and dispositional trust (toward people and technology), and their willingness to share various personal information with the chatbot were measured. The results showed that the trust toward the chatbot was a significant predictor of willingness of self-disclosure. While users’ dispositional social trust and trust in technologies predicted the context-specific trust in the chatbot, this relationship was moderated by the social cues embedded in the technology. Additional analyses also showed that the experimental conditions moderated the effect of target-specific trust toward the chatbot on willingness of self-disclosure.\n","Abstract Body: Machines, particularly those with artificial intelligence (AI), have started to substitute human laborers and take roles that have until now been occupied by human agents. This phenomenon indicates that society is beginning the shift from ‘Assisting-Machine Era’ to ‘Substituting-Machine Era.’ Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) are chosen to explain this shift and the resulting new era of human-machine relationship. However, ANT and CASA respectively have limitations.  This article suggests that these two theories can be productively brought together to compensate for each other’s shortcomings in making sense of AI. In making this argument, this article draws upon the case of using AI programs in the recruiting process. An integrative understanding of the theories is expected to provide insights to both STS and HCI studies by providing broader methodological opportunities.\n","Abstract Body: Robots are becoming an integral part of society, yet the extent to which we are pro-social towards these non-living objects is unclear. While previous research shows that we tend to take care of robots in high-risk, high-consequence situations, this has not been investigated in more day-to-day, low-consequence situations. Thus, we utilized an experimental paradigm (the Social Mindfulness – SoMi paradigm) that involved a trade-off between participants’ own interest and their willingness to take their task partner’s needs into account.<br />In two experiments, we investigated whether people would take the needs of a robot into account to the same extent as when the task partner was a human (Study I), and whether this was modulated by people’s anthropomorphic attributions (Study II). In Study I, participants were presented with a social decision-making task which they performed once by themselves (in a solo context), and once with a task partner (either a human or a robot). Subsequently, in Study II, participants performed the same task but this time both with a human and a robot task partner. The task partners were described in either neutral or anthropomorphic priming stories.<br />Results indicate that the effect of humanizing a task partner indeed increases our tendency to take someone else’s needs into account in a social decision-making task. However, this effect was only found for a human task partner; not for a robot. Thus, while anthropomorphizing a robot may lead us to save it when it is about to perish, it does not make us more socially considerate of a machine. people attribute affective states to robots, they are less likely to sacrifice them in order to save humans.\n","Abstract Body: The advent of new technology has transformed how we currently view artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI was developed to complete tasks, but AI has been taking on more relationship-related roles, such as functioning as a companion. However, little is known about how individuals view different types of AI. Thus, the current study conducted an experiment to explore the perceptions individuals have of relationship-oriented AI as compared to task-oriented AI. Primary results suggest that individuals have more positive attitudes toward task-oriented AI as compared to relationship-oriented AI. Perceived usefulness of AI mediated the relationship between the AI’s orientation, specifically a task-oriented style, and the attitudes toward and perceived realism of the AI. These results suggest that technology developers should ensure their new technologies are perceived as useful to ensure mass adoption.\n","Abstract Body: Both robots and humans can behave in ways that engender positive and negative evaluations of their behaviors and associated responsibility. However, extant scholarship on the link between agent evaluations and valenced behavior has generally treated (im)moral behavior as a monolithic phenomenon. In contrast, contemporary moral psychology increasingly considers moral judgments to unfold in relation to a number of moral foundations: care, fairness, authority, loyalty, purity, and liberty. The present investigation seeks to discover whether social judgments of humans and robots emerge differently as a function of moral foundation-specific behaviors. This work is conducted in two studies: 1) a large-scale online survey featuring agents delivering observed/mediated responses to moral dilemmas and 2) a smaller laboratory-based replication with agents delivering interactive/live responses. In each study, participants evaluate the goodness and blame of six foundation-specific behaviors, and evaluate the agent for mind, morality, and trust. Across these studies, findings suggest that moral judgments of behavior are agent-agnostic, but the ways that behaviors contribute to social evaluations differs by agent: humans must satisfy basic indicators of morality, while robots must comprehensively exhibit goodness, suggesting there is a moral baseline set by humans that robots must exceed. Even with good behavior, robots may garner moral status but that does not guarantee they garner trust.\n","Abstract Body: Smart Speakers like Amazon Echo have spread rapidly in recent years and are becoming increasingly popular, but so far little is known about their adoption in the domestic environment. Innovation theory and the domestication approach provide useful theoretical frameworks to understand the underlying mechanisms of adopting Smart Speakers. With the help of a computational content analysis (<i>Topic Model<\/i>) of 16,474 user-generated posts and reviews, we examined the reported adoption process of Smart Speakers and the factors that promote and inhibit it, as well as the effects of their use on everyday life and household structures. We found that users develop different patterns of use that vary in intensity. Among other things, the perception of relative advantage, complexity, and an emotional component were found to be conducive to adoption and further use. Data protection or a lack of speech recognition, for example, were mentioned as inhibiting factors. In addition, the data suggest that Smart Speakers are becoming an integral part of everyday life for many people and can induce changes or new constructions of rooms, daily routines and structures within the household.\n","Abstract Body: Online social bots have the potential to provide social support for members in online communities. However, there is a lack of understanding of how members perceive bots as support providers. From the perspective of online lurkers, the current study intends to investigate how lurkers evaluate the credibility and social attractiveness of a social bot that provides emotional support. Using a 2 (support provider type: Bot versus Human) x 2 (support message type: high person-centered (HPC) versus low person-centered (LPC)), the study found that human support providers were perceived to be more credible and socially attractive than a bot supporter. Also, when lurkers saw a supportive interaction using HPC messages, they evaluated a support provider more positively than through the LPC messages. Finally, our study found that lurker's comparison with the support seeker moderated the effects of message types on the evaluation of the support provider. <br />\n","Abstract Body: There are various benefits of aging in place, whereby older people remain in their own homes and avoid residential care. For this to take place, it is crucial that older people maintain effective relationships with support networks and that support networks have adequate information to care for them. This study explores how technology that connects older people with their support networks could assist older people to age in place and enhance their health and wellbeing. We undertook 41 interviews with older adults and their informal support networks and 7 focus groups with 44 participants working in aged care to identify how smart home and communication technologies could assist aging in place. Drawing from business rules derived from the analysis, a technological system was developed that unobtrusively monitors older adults and transfers information via email and/or text messaging. The system was prototyped with 17 participants for 5 months, and participants reported an increased feeling of security and improved interpersonal communication. The findings indicate that smart home and communication technologies can assist aging in place when key barriers are overcome.\n","Abstract Body: In recent years mindfulness meditation apps – which offer voice-guided exercised for relaxation – have been promoted as an effective tool for self-managing stress. This study examines how the type of voice – human male, human female, synthetic male, synthetic female– can impact users’ levels of relaxation, perceived usefulness, cognitive demand, and enjoyment when following a guided meditation. Participants listened to a guided meditation, and then evaluated their feelings towards the voice and the meditation exercise. Those who listened to a human voice (male or female) rated the voice as more enjoyable, useful, and relaxing than those who listened to a synthetic voice. Respondents in the human voice conditions also rated the meditation exercise itself as more enjoyable than those who listened to a synthetic voice. Contrary to previous literature on stereotyping and gendered voice, voice gender (male vs. female) had no effect on enjoyment of the voice or enjoyment of the meditation. These findings suggest that natural speech, regardless of gender is preferable, to individuals completing guided mindfulness exercises; In order to be enjoyable and perceived as effective by users, generated speech should sound human-like and utilize natural speech patterns.\n","Abstract Body: This meta-analysis examined the effectiveness of nostalgic messages on ad persuasiveness. Based on 19 articles (26 studies, 33 pairs of comparisons, <i>N<\/i> = 5,119), this study found that nostalgia messages have a nearly medium effect on persuasion (<i>d<\/i> = 0.48, 95% <i>CI<\/i> [.38, .59], <i>p<\/i> < .001). Additionally, the effect size of nostalgic messages tended to become stronger if 1) the advertised product was high in hedonic values, 2) a link between the brand/product and personal memories was present, or 3) the study was conducted by the research group of Marchegiani and Phau. However, the effect size became smaller if the advertised product was high in utilitarian values. Implications, future directions, and limitations are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: How does a vivid and realistic experience in the simulated virtual world affect our attitudes and behaviors in the physical world? Based on two conceptualizations of presence, this study tested two competing theoretical claims, presence-as-perceptual-realism and presence-as-attention-allocation. In a lab-based virtual-reality experiment, we examined the effect of user perspective (first vs. third person) and physical proximity (near vs. far) on behavioral adoption of vaccination. Participants (N = 97) engaged in a simulated experience of being sick at school, with other virtual agents urging them to see a doctor, who then offers vaccination. Those in the third-person perspective showed more vaccine acceptance. Mediation analysis suggests that first-person perspective functions through increased presence and social connectedness, whereas the third-person perspective promotes more cognitive processing based on the opposite mechanism of presence, namely absence or detachment from the mediated environment. In addition, physical proximity magnifies social influence. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: People are likely to use their knowledge as a frame of reference when they try to assess another person’s perspective. Due to this egocentric anchoring, people often overestimate the extent to which others share their viewpoint. In this preregistered study, we investigated which type of feedback (if any) stimulates perceivers to move away from an egocentric interpretation. We allocated participants to one of the three feedback conditions (none, explicit, implicit). Findings showed that participants who were given the opportunity to learn through feedback not only adjusted their perspective-judgment more than those who did not receive feedback, they also showed less egocentric projection on future assessments. Participants adjusted their perspective within the same trial to the same degree for both feedback types. However, participants receiving explicit feedback about their perspective-taking accuracy were less likely to project their perspective onto others on new trials than participants receiving this feedback implicitly. Implications of these findings for theories of perspective-taking are discussed. The preregistration and anonymized data of this study are accessible via the Open Science Framework.\n","Abstract Body: Online contexts, especially social networking sites, are becoming a widely available space to disseminate health information and target specific populations for health campaigns. Limited evidence for health message engagement in these contexts exists. This study draws on the elaboration likelihood model and construal level theory to predict processing time and recall when individuals are presented health messages. Participants (<i>n <\/i>= 159) were shown messages about electronic cigarettes, designed to look like tweets, from socially close and socially distant message senders. Processing times were highest for pro-attitudinal messages while messages from socially close sources were more likely to be recalled, and furthering social distance increased the difference in processing times for pro- and counter-attitudinal messages. We demonstrate the applicability of behavioral measures in online studies, while finding that attitudes, social distance, and their interaction affect message processing. Findings suggest theoretical refinement may be needed to differentiate between processing time and elaboration, while also providing practitioners with guidance on reaching target audiences.\n","Abstract Body: The persuasive effect of food cues in food advertising has been well recognized as effective and is highly utilized by food marketers. However, little research has focused on how different types of food cues create different levels of appetitive motivational activation. This study tested the effects of social eating cues (individual vs. group eating cues) in fast food advertisements on emotional feelings, arousal level, and behavioral control. Our results indicated that food ads with group eating cues elicited stronger appetitive activation resulting in greater orbicularis oculi activation, greater skin conductivity level, indicating that positive emotional feelings and sympathetically arousal level resultant from appetitive motivational activation. Besides, compared to individual eating cues, group eating cues also lead to less behavioral control to the advertised food products. This study identifies the persuasive effect of group eating cues (vs. individual eating cues) in fast food ads. Advertising and marketing professionals and content designers should engage the theoretically-driven strategy to make their marketing messages more compelling.\n","Abstract Body: Based on previous studies that showed a memory benefit for information violating schemas than information complying with schemas, the present study tested whether the schema effect could be extended to social cues such as the gender stereotype. Real (Experiment 1) and made-up (Experiment 2) advertisement that were either congruent or incongruent with the gender stereotype were presented to the participants as the memory materials in the training stage. In the testing stage, the participants had to judge whether or not a given advertisement had been presented in the training stage. The results of both experiments revealed a memory benefit for stereotype-incongruent advertisements with respect to the congruent advertisements. For the purchase intention, a higher value was observed for the gender stereotype-congruent advertisement than incongruent ones. Specifically for the made-up advertisements, a higher purchase intention “gain” was observed for the incongruent advertisements than congruent ones. That is, viewing a stereotype-incongruent image increased the viewer’s purchase intention more than congruent ones.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores the online Word of Mouth on generating consumer-brand engagement on the social media environment, as well as its impact on a brand’s financial value, using Signaling Theory revised by Erdem and Swait (1998). This relationship is examined using data collected from January 2016 to December 2017 on US brand performances and Facebook engagement measures including “Likes” and “the number of users talking about this brand”. The results are in line with the principles of Signaling theory, showing that a brand’s word-of-mouth generated in social media channels can serve as a significant motivator, which may lead to greater consumer engagement with brands, thereby to positively impact the brand’s financial values.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: Brand value, digital engagement, social media, brand equity\n","Abstract Body: Luxury brands have been increasing their investments in creating compelling contents that communicate brand values and stories on social media. Yet, research on understanding the mechanisms of luxury content marketing in brand building is still scarce. Drawing on the literatures of value perceptions, brand prestige/exclusivity, customer intimacy, and brand loyalty, we proposed and tested a comprehensive conceptual model explicating the mechanisms through which the perceived values of luxury content marketing on social media (i.e., YouTube) shapes brand loyalty among luxury purchasers. Our findings demonstrate that, the perceived experiential value and unique value of luxury brand’s content marketing, as well as the functional value of its YouTube channel, are positively related to perceived brand prestige, brand exclusivity, and customer intimacy, respectively, which in turn, are associated with brand loyalty. The perceived social value is negatively related to brand prestige, which is then associated with decreased brand loyalty. The perceived informative value of luxury content marketing is positively related to brand loyalty.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined the influence of repetition-variation ads and consumers’ mood states on attitudes and purchase intention. Drawing upon the optimum stimulation level theory and communication style literature, the results showed that consumers with HC were more persuaded by ads with repetition variation than ads with repetition without variation. Also, the findings revealed positive relationships between stimulation and ad effectiveness and between communication style and ad effectiveness.\n","Abstract Body: Singlish, a colloquial form of English that is commonly used in Singapore, is an integral and unique aspect of the Singaporean identity. This paper explores how language variations (i.e. Singlish vs Standard English) influences advertising effectiveness among Singaporeans. Furthermore, this paper investigates how different message appeals will interact with language to affect consumer responses to advertising.\n","Abstract Body: In this extended abstract, we propose an eye-tracking study to explore how visual attention varies between four different types of visual metaphors appearing in advertisements.\n","Abstract Body: A 2 (Ad Format: 360-degree video ad vs. regular video ad) x 2 (Narrative Structure: Narrative vs. Non-narrative) between subject online experiment (N = 119) was conducted to investigate the combinatory effects of ad format, narrative structure, and need for cognition on product intentions. Results showed the 360-degree video ad elicited lower information seeking intention, tryout intention, and purchase intention compared with a regular video ad. The flow experience mediated the relationship between ad format and product intentions. Narrative structure moderated the relationship between ad format and information seeking intention. In addition, a three-way interaction among ad format, narrative structure, and need for cognition on information seeking intention was detected. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.\n","Abstract Body: By using VR to simulate a job interview, the current investigation explores how users, who were job applicants in the simulation, perceived the experience. Specifically, emoji was tested to see if using it was related to better self-evaluation and higher sense of presence. Additionally, the effect of same- or mixed-sex dyads on presence and performance evaluation is explored.\n","Abstract Body: While some research exists on horror video games, few, if any, have focused on the subject of enjoyment. This study builds on the dimensional theory of emotion and utilizes the media psychophysiology paradigm in order to assess how players respond to horror video game content. This study features a custom developed horror video game designed with elements of fear reported in existing literature in order to evoke emotional responses in players. The psychophysiology paradigm allows these reactions to be assessed in real-time. By combining sensation-seeking and physiological measures, this study aims to better understand how these factors may impact the enjoyment of a horror video game.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Virtual reality (VR) is seeing growing adoption and scholarly attention on its potential. One potential is the use of VR toward positive attitude and behavioral change, proponents promoted VR as the “ultimate empathy machine”. Thus far, early studies have shown optimistic support of VR’s prosocial effects on people’s attitudes and behaviors towards social issues, such as climate change, homelessness, and refugees. In our study, we investigated VR’s compared to traditional media’s effect in eliciting empathy and prosocial intent and behavior towards refugees. We randomly assigned 127 children to either watch a documentary on child refugees on a VR headset, a traditional screen with 360<sup>o<\/sup> view, or with no interactions. Our preliminary results show no differences in eliciting prosocial support. Thus, we caution proponents in taking a practical view of VR’s potential.\n","Abstract Body: With advances in virtual reality (VR) technologies for designing immersive and interactive game contents, VR exergames have gained much popularity in recent years. VR exergames are known as virtual game contents that are also a form of exercise. VR exergames have merits in that they allow users to enjoy fitness activities in relatively a safe and comfortable environment (i.e., home). Another merit of VR exergames might pertain to the fact that they can reduce the constraints in time, space, and budget that are required to enjoy outdoor fitness activities.<br />Previous research has found that intrinsic motivation (IM) is one of the most decisive factors that is predictive of exercise adherence (Ryan et al., 1997). Accordingly, researchers have long searched for the design factors that could contribute to maintaining players’ IM in exergames. A plethora of empirical studies have established the evidence that rendering immersiveness through VR technologies (Farrow et al., 2019; Finkelstein et al., 2011) and/or presenting feedback messages (Kim & Timmerman, 2016) or competitive rivals (Snyder et al., 2012) to players may have positive impact on exercise performance and experiences by making players maintain their IM.<br />Intriguingly, while the evidence is limited, previous works suggest that the mapping of screen speed and players’ mental or motor capacity in exergames might also contribute to maintaining players’ IM insofar as mental or motor capacity reflects individuals’ capacity to engage in exercise. For example, Grodal (2000) demonstrates that people are likely to enjoy video games most when the speed of the game is matched to the players’ optimal mental and motor capacity. Similarly, the study of Jeon (2002) also implies that the mapping of the screen speed and players’ mental or motor capacity may be necessary for inducing favorable experiences in exergames. Specifically, using the electroencephalogram (EEG), this research has found that people enjoyed the driving experiences most when they drove at the speed of 120km/h, while they experienced boredom when they drove at the speed of 100km/h. However, when they were given a task to drive at the speed of 140km/h and 160km/h, mental overload was signaled by the brain wave. These findings indicate that rendering a certain level of screen speed that matches players’ mental or motor capacity in exergames may contribute to maintaining players’ IM, thereby leading to positive game experiences.<br />Taken together, this research explores the potential interaction between screen speed and the level of IM, as well as its effects on user perceptions. Specifically, this study aims to address whether and how varying VR screen speed will interact with IM (i.e., previous participation in an activity without any external pressure; Deci & Ryan, 1985) in influencing user perceptions such as a) flow (i.e., immersion), b) perceived enjoyment, c) attitude towards the game, and d) intention to replay the game in the context of a VR exergame.\n","Abstract Body: <br />Within the last decade, new understandings of how the mind and emotions work have led to new theories on emotional responses to media. This study explores Virtual Reality (VR) and its effects on mental processing and emotions. Specifically, it looks at embodied emotions and physical reactions to virtual stimuli. In this study of fourteen subjects, participants were able to identify emotions and were able to place those emotions at specific body regions. They reported physical sensations and reaction to VR such as increased heart rate and sweating, even when they “knew” in their mind the stimuli were not real. This work supports the Theory of Constructed Emotions indicating emotions are constructed through a combination of environment, embodiment and brain processing.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Female candidates often receive more media coverage about their personal characteristics and personal lives, and less coverage about substantive issues such as policies than their male counterparts. This disproportionate focus on the personal traits of female candidates can be a detriment as it can lead voters to question the legitimacy of female candidates as elected officials. But, are all voters equally likely to evaluate female candidates primarily by their personal characteristics? The primary goal of our study is to examine which individuals are more likely to evaluate female or male candidates with personal or policy information. Utilizing an eye tracking experiment, we find that those who know little about politics -- political novices -- were more likely to pay attention to policy information for men than women. In contrast, politically knowledgeable individuals were more likely to pay attention to policy information at similar levels for both men and women. The results suggest that political novices rely on gender stereotypes when evaluating candidates and political sophisticates likely do not.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br /><br />The growth of global interconnectivity, via digital technologies for example, also brings greater conflicts over moral judgements and punishments as different moral frameworks come into contact. While research indicates a set of universal moral foundations underlying any moral framework, assumptions of a universal moral framework hides the fact that moral systems develop within localized contexts with differing cultures and histories. Situating morality as contextual also indicates that time also factors in to differences that may emerge. Although the same foundations may be present across groupings, moral frameworks, the construction and application of those foundations to their specific contexts, are always undergoing an active process of change.<br /><br />In the current work, we present a framework of moral relativity that aims to account for both the rapid developments in technology and the disproportionate lag in technology laws. When people experience new forms of injustices afforded by advanced technology that are unaccounted for by law and policy, they engage in public democratic discussions of moral right and wrong. These discussions run the danger of becoming violent, however, when individuals and groups each invoke competing rigid moral frameworks. We suggest a framework of moral relativity that encourages the acknowledgement of the within-subject variability and fallibility of all moral judgments.\n","Abstract Body: Online incivility becomes widespread and unavoidable worldwide, but most empirical studies of online incivility are confined to the U.S. context. In China, the presence of online incivility becomes a pressing issue recently. To understand the impacts of online incivility on deliberation quality in China, we conducted a content analysis of uncivil comments from a Chinese news website. The results suggest that although online incivility is negatively associated with discourse quality, it appears to have some positive consequences for the engagement in China. Besides, the effects of online incivility on deliberation quality is contingent upon the types, degrees, and targets of incivility.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores the impact of media literacy interventions in reducing the biased perception of congenial partisan media. Using an online experiment, participants were 1) asked to identify their own biases and 2) presented with the attributes of partisan media before reading congenial media content. Results show the perceptions of congenial partisan media were not affected by either intervention. However, liberals were more likely to perceive their congenial media text as less credible than conservatives.\n","Abstract Body: Recent (im)politeness studies have paid more attention to their situational evaluation, focusing on identifying the evaluators and the adopted norms of evaluation. While scholars have examined the cultural underpinnings of participants’ evaluation, few have systematically studied how their (im)politeness evaluations are induced from more immediate linguistic co-texts. The proposed study will employ a 3*2 factorial design with observed (im)politeness action (impolite others, polite others, or mixed) and observed (im)politeness evaluation (favor politeness vs. favor impoliteness) as between-participant factors. The dependent variable will be (im)politeness production. Participants will be recruited from MTurk. Each participant will first read an unethical event and three (im)polite comments on the event. Then the participant will be asked to write down their comments and answer related questions. The proposed study intends to deepen our understanding of how (im)politeness production is influenced by others’ (im)polite behaviors, others’ (im)politeness evaluation, their perceived (im)politeness standard, and their perceived group membership.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Previous research on the success of politicians’ messages on social media has so far focused on a limited number of platforms, especially Facebook and Twitter, and predominately studied the effects of textual features. In this research, we applied computer vision analysis to a total of 59,020 image posts published by 172 Instagram accounts of U.S. politicians and examined how visual attributes influenced audience engagement such as likes and comments. In particular, we combined transfer learning and clustering techniques to develop an unsupervised approach to reveal hidden clusters from large-scale visual data. We revealed that different self-personalization strategies in visual media, for example, featuring politicians in private, non-political settings, showing faces, and displaying emotions, generally increased audience engagement, yet politicians in the sample still used Instagram in a more traditional, “politics-as-usual” manner. This study helps us better understand how self-personalization is embodied in specific visual portrayals and how they influenced audience engagement on a popular but less studied platform, while also making a methodological contribution by showing the potential of computational methods in analyzing political images.\n","Abstract Body: Based on critical examination about the recent debate on the relationship between perceived effectiveness (PE) and actual effectiveness (AE) of campaign messages, this study investigated three remaining issues: the relationship between manipulated argument quality and various measures of PE, the relationship between actual attitude change and various measures of PE, and direct comparison between actual attitude change and perceived attitude change. A two-wave panel online experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 376) was conducted in which argument quality was manipulated and attitudes toward the issue was measured before and after message exposure. Results showed that (a) both perceived argument quality and perceived persuasiveness well represented the effect of manipulated argument quality, (b) various measures of PE were found to have a positive effect on actual attitude change, (c) PE-AE correlations were positive for both the cross-message cases and the message-specific cases, (d) when initial attitude was incongruent with message position, perceived amount of attitude change was smaller than actual amount of attitude change for both the strong and the weak argument messages, which indicates underestimation of message effectiveness.\n","Abstract Body: There has been no text analytics-based study of the differences between persuasive and inspiring speeches to date. Using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model and LIWC parser, this study analyzes TED talk transcripts from 2006 to 2017. The results show that both types of talk have rising arcs, with positive emotions reaching a peak in the final segment of the talk. In addition, both make strong references to rewards, religion and morality. Nonetheless, persuasive talks feature more anger and risk and engage more viewers than inspiring talks. On the other hand, inspiring talks are more emotional than persuasive talks. The implications of these findings for speech communication will be discussed in the final paper. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Political advertisers have access to increasingly sophisticated microtargeting techniques. One such technique is tailoring ads to the personality traits of citizens. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of this technique. In two experiments, we investigate the causal effects of personality-congruent political ads. In study 1, we first assess participants’ extraversion trait by means of their own text data (i.e., by using automated text analyses), and in a second phase, target them with either a personality-congruent or incongruent political ad. In study 2, we followed the same protocol, but instead targeted participants with emotionally-charged congruent ads, to establish whether PMT can prey into hopes and fears. The results show evidence that citizens are more strongly persuaded by political ads that match their own personality traits. These findings feed into relevant and timely contributions to a salient academic and societal debate.\n","Abstract Body: Many self-affirmation studies choose not to measure perceptions of self-affirmation as an induction check, arguing that including this measurement can cause a reactive effect that influences people’s subsequent responses. To examine this argument, a 2 (self-affirmation induction: treatment vs. control) x 3 (induction check: self-affirmation scale vs. self-integrity scale vs. no induction check) experiment and a meta-analysis were performed. Inconsistent with the argument, both the experiment and the meta-analysis did not find any evidence for the reactive effect of measuring perceptions of self-affirmation. Moreover, the experiment showed that perceptions of self-affirmation mediated the impact of self-affirmation on behavioral intention. Methodological and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.<br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> self-affirmation, reactive effect, induction check, meta-analysis\n","Abstract Body: Under proper conditions, the pique and foot-in-the-door techniques are effective approaches to gaining compliance. The <i>pique technique<\/i> of compliance-gaining involves asking strangers for an unusual amount of money or time (e.g., 17 or 37 cents). In the original pique studies, targets who were asked for a quarter (the control request) complied at a rate of 31%, whereas targets asked for 17 cents (the pique request) complied at a rate of 43%. One explanation for the technique’s effectiveness suggests that unusual requests “pique” targets’ attention and disrupt targets’ mindless refusal scripts. The current study seeks to test boundaries of the pique in a field experiment requesting students to volunteer their time for the Alzheimer’s Association (alz.org). We propose the technique may be more successful when used in combination with the <i>foot-in-the-door<\/i> technique (FITD; Freedman & Fraser, 1966), and may help to overcome the limitations of the FITD technique.<br />The FITD process begins by asking a target to comply with a small request. If compliance occurs, a larger request follows. Previous research indicates that the FITD procedure is generally more persuasive than making large requests only (Burger, 1999). However, the strategy is unusable if someone refuses to comply with the initial request. Considering previous research that suggests unusual requests are more persuasive than typical requests (Burger et al., 2007; Gueguen et al., 2016; Santos et al., 1994), it seems reasonable to suspect that embedding unusual requests into the FITD procedure might improve its effectiveness. Perhaps attention-gaining elements, such as the pique technique, help to overcome limitations of the FITD technique by boosting compliance with the initial request. Once someone agrees to a small request, they may agree to larger requests at similar rates regardless of whether pique first or FITD was used. However, if the initial request incorporating the pique technique gains a larger pool of people agreeing to a first request, then overall, the pique technique combined with FITD should end up with a higher rate of compliance. In other words, the pique and FITD techniques, in combination, should provide an additive effect on compliance, when targets are approached with an atypical <i>first<\/i> request (i.e., the pique request) that theoretically heightens their interest. We call this the <i>pique-in-the-door<\/i> (PITD) strategy. Furthermore, we speculate that the PITD should work better than the original pique technique due to the benefit accrued from adding the initial request for compliance. We hypothesize that <i>the pique-in-the-door technique (PITD) will yield higher compliance when compared to (a) the original pique technique and (b) foot-in-the-door (FITD) technique<\/i>.<br />In contrast, the persuasiveness of approaches that incorporate the pique technique into the second request of a FITD message is more tentative. Thus, we test two versions of a second-pique message: “the twin-piques technique” (TP), which uses a small pique-like initial request, and follows up with a larger pique-like request and “the foot-in-a-pique technique” (FIAP), which uses a standard initial request followed by a larger pique-like second request. We ask the following research question regarding these techniques: <i>Will any of the combined FITD-plus-pique techniques (i.e., PITD, TP, FIAP) be more effective in gaining compliance than each other? <\/i><br />In the fall semester, 300 students walking across campus were approached at a northeastern university. Four research assistants (RAs) made requests to targets. Similar to other compliance gaining field tests (Burger et al., 2007; Guéguen et al., 2016), targets responded to one of six variations of a pique request or a control request first asking to take a quick Alzheimer’s survey, followed by a request to attend a meeting (See Appendix for the requests). Each target was randomly assigned to one of the six conditions. The RAs donned Alzheimer’s Association (AA) t-shirts and carried a clipboard with AA stickers. The RAs worked in pairs and took turns making the request or taking notes. While one made the request, the other observed the interaction and recorded: responses to the requests, demographic information, and contact information to provide to the AA for follow-up. Contact information was separated to a new file at the end of each data collection period to remove identifying information necessary for the volunteer work from the data. RAs also recorded brief notes on any comments, questions, or gestures made by the targets. Targets were not debriefed as the request is legitimately for the Alzheimer’s Association.<br />To test the hypotheses, we will use planned contrasts to compare the techniques. At the time of writing these results, it is yet unknown how many of the targets actually attended one of the information meetings. Data from a pre-test sample was analyzed and found the pique requests for initial compliance were better received by targets than the non-pique/traditional requests. Specifically, a chi-square that compared compliance across the four sequential request conditions found a significant effect, and a follow-up planned contrast that compared the two pique-first requests (TP, PITD) to the foot requests for time (FITD, FITP) was statistically significant (<i>p<\/i> < .05). A codebook was developed based on the descriptions of target’s responses noted by the RAs and coded independently by two coders (see Table 1). A chi-square test compared the responses across the foot-first or pique-first conditions and indicated a significant effect as well. In the foot-first conditions (FITD, FIAP), targets were more inclined to give excuses as to why they could not talk or comply with the RAs than in the pique-first conditions. We intend to run similar analyses and use the developed codes for the current study’s analyses.<br />In conclusion, the current study seeks to determine if combining tactics boosts the effectiveness of either the pique or the FITD technique and introduces new compliance-gaining approaches. Understanding these approaches is important for both theoretical and applied reasons, particularly in this context of volunteering and awareness efforts.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Is the effectiveness of narrative susceptible to the influence of peripheral cues related to source and other audience members? A 3 (source: CDC vs. a victim vs. AI) x 2 (bandwagon: low vs. high) x 2 (topic: opioid vs. skin cancer) between-subjects experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 395) was conducted. Results showed that when the same story was told by different sources or was associated with different numbers of likes, viewers evaluated the message and the source differently, which in turn affected how they processed the story and how much they were persuaded by the story.\n","Abstract Body: Visual social network platform Instagram, led to an increase of visual brand-related user-generated content (Br-UGC). Consequently, visual BR-UGC has the potential to affect brand outcomes. Despite Instagram’s social character, tie strength (i.e., emotional bond) between sender and receiver is under examined. We expect that tie strength enhances visual BR-UGC effectiveness, especially because visual content allows the sender to be visually present, and to convey facial expressions. The current research adopts a two-step approach to examine tie strength for content displaying (1) no sender, (2) sender with a neutral expression, or (3) sender with a happy expression. Results show that presence of the sender significantly increases like and comment intention. Furthermore, a happy as compared to neutral expression leads to a more favorable brand attitude. For comment intention, a moderating effect of tie strength was observed, with larger effects of the presence of the sender for higher levels of tie strength.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Misinformation continues to influence inferences even after it is discredited, making it<br />extremely difficult to completely erase the detrimental effects of it. With a two-wave online<br />experiment, this research tested how the effectiveness of misinformation correction are<br />influenced by (1) whether correction is presented before or after misinformation and (2)<br />whether correction is accompanied by a message that increases the coherence between<br />misinformation and correction message (i.e., a debiasing message). Results showed that<br />presenting a correction after the misinformation and with a debiasing message both enhances<br />people’s memory of the correction message. These effects persisted at least one week after<br />the initial exposure to the correction. The results provide a memory-based explanation to why<br />retracting misinformation is more effective than inoculating against it and offer theoretical<br />and practical implications on misinformation correction.\n","Abstract Body: Extended Abstract<br />According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for 90 % of anal and cervical cancers, and 50 % of vaginal and penile cancers in the U.S. (CDC, 2018). Vaccination is not only an important preventive step toward not receiving HPV infection but also not getting cancer in the future. HPV vaccine is, however, underutilized and refused by many parents, and the major reason for the refusal is the heavy volume of misinformation they are exposed to on the Internet or social media (Kempe et al., 2019). The lack of knowledge among U.S. adults (aged 27 and older) also contributes to making them vulnerable to HPV misinformation, reinforcing low HPV vaccination rate (Suk et al., 2019).<br />Responding to the prevalence of misinformation on social media, recent research has explored strategies such as observational correction (van der Meer & Jin, 2019), rhetorical techniques (van der Linden, Leiserowitz, Rosenthal, & Maibach, 2017), and fact-based corrections (Schmid & Betsch, 2019) to debunk misinformation online. Observational correction happens when individuals see others being corrected on social media. This seems to encourages people to form more accurate attitudes toward various issues (Vraga & Bode, 2017). Rhetorical strategies refer to correction techniques that are based on critical thinking skills to find logical flaws in misinformation (Cook, Lewandowsky, & Ecker, 2017), whereas factual corrections rely mostly on expert sources or scientific information (Vraga & Bode, 2018).<br />Extending this line of inquiry, we examine the nuances of correcting misinformation online. In other words, based on the well-established exemplification theory, we aim to understand how narrative vs. statistics or a combination of the two could amplify the effect of logic-based observational correction strategies. Exemplification theory uses vivid and engaging exemplars such as graphics, images, or narratives to convey information effectively (Zillmann, 1999). Zillmann (1999) argues that exemplars can serve as a reflection of a larger issue, which subsequently influences individuals’ perceptions and attitudes toward the issue. It has been widely applied to study various health contexts including HPV (Kim, Namkoong, Fung, Heo, & Gunther, 2018); Nan, Dahlstrom, Richards, & Rangarajan, 2015). For instance, Nan and her colleagues (2015) has shown that a combination of narrative and statistics exemplars in a message resulted in greater risk perceptions of HPV, compared to either only narrative or statistics conditions.<br />Furthermore, studying attention to social media messages can offer insights on the mechanism by which correction strategies reduce the influence of misinformation. Little research, however, has examined attention on social media in context of misinformation correction. This study, therefore, aims to fill this gap by studying attention as a potential mediator with regards to debunking HPV misinformation on Facebook. Eye tracking measures will be used to provide unobtrusive behavioural data, complementing self-reported survey data. Based on the above discussion, the following hypotheses and research questions are proposed.<br />H1: The combined condition will generate the most attention to different areas of the Facebook messages followed by narrative and statistics only conditions.<br />H2: The combined condition will reduce HPV vaccine misperceptions the most, followed by narrative and statistics only conditions.<br />RQ1: Will message attention to different areas of the Facebook messages mediate the relationship between the experimental condition and HPV vaccine misperceptions?<br />RQ2: Will there be other individual characteristics that influence the proposed relationships?<br /><br />Methods<br />We will conduct a between-subject experiment to examine three different types of rebuttals that work in clarifying misperceptions about the connection between HPV vaccine and autism. The three different types of manipulation messages are developed as screenshots from Facebook consisting of a Facebook post talking about the connection between HPV and autism. Each post will also consist of four comments. The first comment, consistent across all conditions, offers an explanation about the logical fallacy associated with the HPV vaccine-autism link. The other two comments provide further corrective information about the HPV vaccine as a narrative, as statistics or as mixed. The last comment is a dummy comment consistent across all conditions. The length of the messages is approximately the same. To avoid potential confounding effects, generic image and names are used in all post and comments. See Figure 1 for a narrative condition message.<br />The study was recently approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the first author’s institution, and data collection begins early November of 2019 and continue until the aimed sample size is reached. We aim to collect 100-120 participants to have sufficient power to find statistical significance across experimental conditions. A recent meta-analysis concludes that the average sample size for a published eye tracking study in communication is 74 (King, Bol, Cummins, & John, 2019). Along with online pretest and posttest surveys, an objective and unobstructive eye tracking technology will be used to measure message attention. The eye tracking portion of the study will be conducted in a biometrics research lab at the first author’s institution, and a screen-based portable eye tracker (Tobii Pro X3-120) is attached to the bottom of a computer screen to capture an individual’s eye movement real time. These behavioral measures complement self-reported data and present an opportunity to more accurately and precisely evaluate message attention and information processing (King, Bol, Cummins, & John, 2019).<br /><br />Results<br />We will use a series of ANCOVAs and PROCESS analyses to examine the proposed relationships (Hayes, 2017). We anticipate the combined condition to be the most effective in generating message attention to HPV misinformation, correction, and in reducing misperceptions. Attention would mediate the relationships and pre-existing HPV misperceptions or participant demographics may moderate such mediating relationships.<br /><br />Discussions/Implications<br />Exemplars are well-established tactics for social influence but never examined its effectiveness in the context of online misinformation correction. This study will improve our ability to address vaccine related misinformation by revealing which exemplars amplify logic-based correction strategies to reduce misinformation. Exploring message attention as a mediator will also help us better understand cognitive pathways individuals engage to reduce vaccine misperceptions. Combatting widespread HPV vaccine misinformation has direct benefits for preventing and mitigating related health challenges such as cervical cancer. This study expands the current misinformation literature by exploring the type of exemplars that amplifies the logic-based correction and its mediating mechanisms to further reduce HPV vaccine misperceptions.<br /><br /><br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Based on recent theory and research on <i>fake news<\/i>, users’ responses to warning messages on social media (“contested by independent fact-checkers”) and linked news articles were examined. We assumed that the influence of warning messages could crucially depend on individual differences in the tendency to engage in self-promotion and norm transgressions as reflected in Machiavellianism and psychopathy, components of the dark triad of personality. A pre-registered experiment with 438 members of an online panel was conducted. The overall influence of warnings on perceived accuracy of the news article and the willingness to share the posting was limited. As expected, interactions between warnings and both traits were observed: Whereas warnings reduced the willingness to share the news item among individuals low on Machiavellianism or psychopathy, warnings had no influence for individuals with high scores on these traits. Participants’ narcissism predicted higher sharing intentions irrespective of the warning messages.\n","Abstract Body: Language plays an important role in people’s information processing. Scholars and health practitioners have studied the effects of linguistic structures on people’s understanding of health information, emphasizing the value of using message strategies to encourage healthy living (O’Keefe, 2012). Antibiotic resistance has becoming a global threat in today’s world (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013). To address this issue, the current study aims to explore the persuasive effects of agency assignment on health educational materials regarding antibiotic resistance as well as human health information processing.<br />Previous research on agentic language has demonstrated its effectiveness on health message processing and persuasiveness enhancement (e.g., Bell, McGlone, Dragojevic, 2014a; Glowacki, McGlone, & Bell, 2016; Zhang & McGlone, 2019). Antibiotic resistance raises a unique issue that the excessive use of antibiotics will not be curative but will foster antibiotic resistance bacteria that affects our health prevention. However, few empirical studies have explored the linguistic effects on enhancing instruction and people’s understanding toward printed educational materials (PEMs) of antibiotic resistance (e.g., Shehadeh, Suaifan, & Hammad, 2016). Linguistic agency assignment, as an intrinsic feature in language, is defined as the ascription of action or change to one or more entities involved in an event. The <i>agent<\/i> is determined by the relationship to the action expressed by the verb in a sentence (Dowty, 1991; Jackendoff, 1972; McGlone, Bell, Zaitchik, & McGlynn, 2013; McGlone & Pfiester, 2009). For example, McGlone et al. (2013) find that assigning agency to H1N1 influenza (e.g., “HINI can strike in any month of the year”) yielded significantly greater level of perceived severity, susceptibility, and greater intention to seek for the vaccination, as compared to the human condition (e.g., “people can contract H1N1 in any month of the year”).<br />The Current Study<br />In the current study, we will explore the persuasive effects of assigning the threat agency to <i>antibiotic-resistant germs<\/i> (e.g., “antibiotic-resistant bacteria can prey on people at any stage of life”) or to <i>humans<\/i> (e.g., “people can pick up antibiotic-resistant bacteria at any stage of life”). We also plan to explore the message effects of temporal agency, which has been applied to examining the persuasive effects of linguistic agency in narrative health messages about colon cancer (Chen et al., 2015). Specifically, we depict antibiotic resistance into two different temporal agentic languages (e.g., <i>antibiotic resistance<\/i>: “the era of antibiotic resistance is fast approaching”; <i>humans<\/i>: “we are fast approaching the era of antibiotic resistance”). Finally, we will explore how agentic visual image facilitates people’s information processing. More specifically, we will assign the activity in the image - <i>taking antibiotics<\/i> as the agency, as compared to the image of <i>antibiotics<\/i> - agentless (or no agency) condition in the current study.<br />As suggested by previous research on health information processing and assessment (e.g., Chen, McGlone, & Bell, 2015; Glowacki et al., 2016), we assess the potential effects of agentic language in antibiotic and antibiotic resistance based on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM). EPPM is informative to understand the construction of risk messages by grounding in fear appeals and scare tactics. The model includes four elements of effective health message design: threat severity, personal susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy (Edgar & Volkman, 2012; Bell, McGlone, & Dragojevic, 2014b; Witte, 1992, 1994). Taken these together, we propose the following hypotheses and research questions:<br />H1: Assignment of threat agency to antibiotic-resistant bacteria rather than to humans will lead to: (a) greater perceived severity of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, (b) greater perceived susceptibility, (c) greater fear arousal, (d) greater intention to taking antibiotics appropriately (self-efficacy), and (e) greater intention to consult with healthcare providers on taking antibiotics (response-efficacy).<br />H2: Assignment of temporal agency to antibiotic resistance rather than to humans will lead to (a) greater perceived severity of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, (b) greater perceived susceptibility, (c) greater fear arousal, (d) greater intention to taking antibiotics appropriately (self-efficacy), and (e) greater intention to consult with healthcare providers on taking antibiotics (response-efficacy).<br />RQ: Will there be a difference in imagery when assigning the taking antibiotics as compared to no agency assignment (antibiotics) regarding perceived severity of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, perceived susceptibility, fear arousal, intention to taking antibiotics appropriately, consult with a healthcare provider on taking antibiotics?<br />Method<br />Participants who are native English speakers and aged 18 years and older will be recruited via using Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk website (Mturk; http://www.mturk.com). They will be invited to participate in an online experiment taking approximately 25 minutes to complete, and the participants will be paid $0.50 through Mturk. In the current investigation, a 2 (threat agency: antibiotic-resistant germ <i>vs<\/i>. human) X 2 (temporal agency: antibiotic resistance <i>vs<\/i>. human) X 2 (imagery: taking antibiotics <i>v<\/i>s. antibiotics) factorial design will be employed. Participants will be randomly presented to one of eight versions (unknown to them) of the antibiotic resistance pamphlet. The materials were compiled based on CDC’s information about antibiotic resistance. One version of the pamphlet is provided in the Appendix. After reading the fact sheet, participants will answer questions about their attitudes and perceptions of antibiotic resistance. The dependent measures will be incorporated into a questionnaire that is comprised of six sections: perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, fear arousal, self-efficacy, response efficacy, and behavioral intention.<br />Expected Results and Implications<br />Data will be collected as soon as the study is approved by IRB. In line with previous studies on linguistic agency, we expect to find that people will report greater fear, severity, susceptibility, and higher intention to seek for healthcare providers’ suggestions about taking antibiotics in the antibiotic-resistant bacteria (threat agency) and antibiotic resistance (temporal agency) condition, as compared to human condition for both threat and temporal agency (H1-H2). It is critical to note that the ascription of causality to some entities involved in an event implicitly conveys the passivity of that entity (Dowty, 1991). In line with this argument, by ascribing causation to the bacteria or antibiotic resistance rather than humans, the threat or time made people conceive itself as a relatively passive entity and the associated risks as out of control. In addressing the research question (RQ) regarding imagery agency, we expect to find people feel greater fear, perceived severity, and susceptibility in the <i>taking antibiotics<\/i> condition, as compared to <i>antibiotics<\/i> (no agent) condition. This phenomenon can be explained through the <i>picture superiority effect<\/i> where texts paired with imagery is more memorable than texts alone, especially when the picture is depicting a risky activity (Seo, Dillard, & Shen, 2013).<br />Our study may contribute to the literature on information processing by highlighting the role of agency assignment in information design and presentation. With the employment of agentic language and images, this study will deepen our understanding of information processing in health contexts, especially for the global threat of antibiotic resistance. This study also has practical implications on public health education and promotion on the smart use of antibiotics.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Social media has become a popular source that individuals refer to for health information (Westerman, Spence, & Van Der Heide, 2014). For instance, social media is utilized as a space where individuals talk to others with the same or similar symptoms of illnesses, compare notes on treatment options, and provide emotional support (Bottles, 2009). And, for those who follow social media pages of certain health organizations, the pages provide up-to-date health information (Bottles, 2009).<br /><br />It has been argued that to gauge quality and credibility of social media’s message content, users often consider peripheral factors, including popular choices earlier users have made, which appear as the number of likes and the number of comments (Sundar, 2008). Sundar (2008) coined the term the “bandwagon effect” and argued that individuals are not likely to systematically process the message’s content and, instead, assume something to be true when many others agree. This is because popularity (cues) is perceived as statistical evidence illustrating the strength and credibility of a message (Baesler & Burgoon, 1994). That is, the effectiveness of social media content can be predicted by the nature of peripheral factors. This study examines how different levels of peripheral factors in social media message influence readers’ visual attention and message effectiveness.<br /><br />According to the dual processing model (Chaiken, 1987), individuals process information either in a heuristic or systematic processing mode. Heuristic processing takes place when individuals do not want to spend the cognitive efforts required for systematic processing. Prior research has argued that social media users, overwhelmed by information and its validity, tend to rely on peripheral factors to make content-selection decisions (Fu & Sim, 2011). That is, the number of likes can serve as a mental shortcut to reduce cognitive strain as the amount of cognitive resource an individual has is limited (Lang, 2000). Thus, the current study investigates whether popularity cues in Facebook health news serve as merely as an attention grabber or provide an additional layer of information relevant to attitudinal and behavioral outcomes. This study also asks whether the effects of popularity cues are moderated by individual difference (i.e., health information relevance), since perceived message relevance can influence message processing. Two research questions are asked:<br /><br />RQ 1a-g: How does the level of the “likes” on Facebook health news affect individuals’ a) visual attention; message processing including b) heuristic processing, and c) systematic processing; and persuasion outcomes including d) perceived message effectiveness, e) message attitude, f) message credibility, and g) behavioral intention to use information?<br /><br />RQ 2a-c: How do individual characteristics such as a) prior experience with health illnesses, b) health information orientation, and c) trust in the source of health information affect how users process Facebook health news with “like” features?<br /><br />Method<br />This study is an eye-tracking experiment, with 12 Facebook health news posts, including research findings on the most common health problems among college students, serving as stimuli. The news posts vary in bandwagon cues (high vs. low) and health topic (e.g., anxiety, migraines, etc. — chosen based on a 2018 National College Health Assessment). Fifty college students will participate.<br /><i>Independent Variables<\/i><br />Bandwagon Cues is conceptualized as peripheral cues that are external to the merits of a core argument of a message and operationalized as the form of Facebook “Likes.” The high “Likes” condition displays Facebook “Likes” (indicated with a number and the Facebook thumbs up symbol) ranging from 100-9,999, while the low “Likes” condition displayed a range of 1-9 “Likes.”<br /><br />Prior experience with health problems is measured by a question, <i>How often do you experience the following illnesses on average<\/i>? on a 5-point scale (<i>never, rarely, sometimes, very often, always<\/i>). The question is rephrased based on the included topics.<br /><br />Health information orientation is measured with 8 items (e.g., <i>I make a point to read and watch stories about health<\/i>), (1<i> = strongly disagree, <\/i>7<i> = strongly agree)<\/i> (Dutta-Bergman, 2004).<br /><br />Trust in sources of health information is measured with 3 items (e.g., <i>I trust health information I read on the internet<\/i>), (1<i> = strongly disagree, <\/i>7<i> = strongly agree)<\/i> (Benotsch, Kalichman, & Weinhardt, 2004).<br /><br /><i>Dependent Variables<\/i><br />Visual Attention is operationalized as: (1) Total viewing time in the area of interest (in seconds); (2) Eye fixation (defined as the moment between eye movements in which the eyes remain relatively still) duration (in milliseconds); and (3) Number of fixations while viewing the stimulus material falling in the area of interest, which were measured through eye-movement equipment (Tobii Pro X2-60) (King, Bol, Cummins, & John, 2019).<br /><br />Message credibility is measured by asking participants to rate how accurate, authentic, and believable the content is (1 <i>= very poorly, <\/i>7<i> =<\/i> <i>very well<\/i>) (Sundar, 1999).<br /><br />Heuristic Processing is measured by 3 items (e.g., “I skimmed through the article”), (1 <i>= strongly disagree,<\/i> 7<i> = strongly agree<\/i>) (Kahlor et al., 2003).<br /><br />Systematic Processing is measured by 3 items (e.g., “I thought about what actions I myself might take based on what I need”), (1<i> = strongly disagree, <\/i>7<i> = strongly agree)<\/i> (Kahlor et al., 2003).<br /><br />Perceived message effectiveness is measured by 4 items (e.g., “The news article was convincing”), (1<i> = strongly disagree, <\/i>7<i> = strongly agree)<\/i> (Kang, Cappella, & Fishbein, 2007).<br /><br />Attitude toward the message is measured by 3 items (e.g., The news article that I just read is: “Dislike – Like” and “Negative – Positive”) (Nan, 2008).<br /><br />Information seeking intention is measured by a question, <i>How likely is it that you would search for more information related to the specific health topic<\/i>? and Behavioral intention is measured with 3 items (e.g., <i>How likely is it that you would like to act on the advice offered in the news article<\/i>?) (1<i> = very unlikely<\/i>, 7<i> =<\/i> <i>very likely<\/i>) (Lee & Sundar, 2013).<br /><br />Study Completion Timeline<br />Data collection is currently in progress. Data analysis will be completed by January 2020, with a full paper prepared for conference presentation by the end of March 2020.\n","Abstract Body: Impact of e-cigarettes ads and PSAs on cigarette smokers’ cognitive and emotional processing<br />E-cigarettes (e-cigs) are increasingly popular, with global sales of over $7 billion (Evans, 2015). The safety of e-cigarettes is a matter of some controversy, particularly in light of recent illnesses and death associated with the product (Corum 2019). While most of these cases seem to be due to products contaminated with THC (“Outbreak of lung injury…, 2019), these events have firmly placed electronic nicotine delivery systems manufacturers in the crosshairs of federal and state regulatory agencies (Corum, 2019) and added to public confusion and concern about the product.<br />Separate from these recent issues, the most comprehensive evidence to date finds that e-cigarettes are approximately 95% safer than cigarettes (PHE, 2015), and are more effective than nicotine replacement therapy in helping smokers quit (Hajek, et a. 2019). While the products have been adopted as smoking cessation devices in some other countries (PHE 2015), they have not been approved for cessation in the U.S. The FDA does not officially allow e-cigarette manufacturers to advertise the products as cessation devices so e-cigarette manufacturers have instead promoted their products as “alternatives” to cigarettes. Anti-vaping campaigns have responded with their own public service advertisements (PSAs) countering that e-cigarettes are not safe and are not cigarette alternatives. There is little research examining how smokers may be responding to these conflicting messages.<br />An additional issue in e-cig advertising is the presence of “smoking” or “vaping” cues in both ads and PSAs, which have been shown to be stimulative to smokers in that their presence can increase attention and encoding of message content but can also result in boomerang effects, such as increased smoking urges and reduced quit intentions (Lee et al., 2011, 2013). Maloney and Cappella (2016) have found that vaping cues can function similarly to smoking cues, demonstrating that vaping visuals in e-cig commercials can significantly increase daily smokers’ urge to smoke, and may also undermine smokers’ attempts to quit when presented in antivaping PSAs. We are interested in whether the positioning of e-cigs as alternatives to cigarettes or countering e-cigs as cigarette alternatives interacts with vaping cues to impact message processing and reactions among adult smokers.<br />In this study we examine the impact of two message types—e-cigs ads and anti-vaping PSAs—across two message execution strategies on cognitive/emotional processing of messages, cigarette smoking and vaping urges, smoking and vaping intentions and quit intentions among adult cigarette smokers. The two executions are whether or not the message frames e-cigs as an alternative to traditional tobacco cigarettes or counters e-cigs as a cigarette alternative, and whether or not the message contains a vaping cue. We employ the Limited Capacity Model of Motivated Mediated Message Processing (LC4MP; Lang 2006) as the theoretical framework by which to infer how adult smokers will cognitively and emotionally respond to e-cig PSAs or ads and the varying message executions. The LC4MP posits that sensory information in our environment activates two motivational systems: appetitive/approach and aversive/avoid that then influence encoding and storage of message content and retrieval of information from memory networks. The appetitive system activates in response to pleasant stimuli (i.e., smoking cues for smokers; Robinson & Berridge, 1993) thereby enhancing encoding of content, whereas the aversive system activates to unpleasant stimuli thereby also resulting in greater encoding of mediated content (i.e., the negativity bias; Cacioppo, Gardner, & Berntson, 1999). However, if the aversive system becomes activated beyond a certain threshold, defensive processing may occur (Cacioppo et al., 1999).<br />The overarching research question we ask is: What is the relationship among message type, vaping cue, and alternative argument on smokers’ cognitive and emotional message processing, smoking urges, smoking intentions and quit intentions among adult smokers?<br />Method<br />The design of this study is a 2 (message type: PSA/ad) × 2 (vaping cue: present/absent) × 2 (alternative or counter to cigarette smoking: present/absent) × 3 (message repetition) mixed experiment. Message type is a between-subjects factor and alternative to tobacco smoking, vaping cue, and message repetition are within-subjects factors. Participants were randomly assigned to view either PSAs or ads. Each participant viewed 3 messages in each of the 2 (vaping cue: present/absent) × 2 (alternative to tobacco smoking: present/absent) conditions in random orders, for a total of 12 messages.<br />Independent Variables<br />Message type (PSA vs. e-cig company ad). The study used two types of messages: PSAs and advertisements. While the contents of e-cig ads intended to persuade participants to buy and consume the product, the content of PSAs oppose the use of e-cigs. Participants were randomly assigned to see either anti-e-cig PSAs or e-cig advertisements.<br />Alternative to cigarette smoking. Alternative to cigarette smoking was conceptualized as message content that depicted e-cigs as a viable alternative to cigarette smoking or not. Half of the ads viewed by the participants presented e-cigs as an alternative to cigarettes (e.g., “why quit?, switch to Blu,”) while half of the PSAs positioned e-cigs as not an alternative to cigarettes (Back off Big Tobacco! We know e-cigarettes are harmful, just like cigarettes!). The other half of the PSAs and the ads mentioned nothing about e-cigs being a viable alternative or not being an alternative.<br />Vaping cue. A vaping cue in a message is an image that presents someone as actual vaping, holding or handling of an e-cig, a pack of e-cigs, or just an image of an e-cig (Maloney & Cappella, 2016). Half of the PSAs and e-cig ads contained a vaping cue, while the other half did not.<br />Dependent Variables<br />Two sets of dependent variables were collected for this study: 1) psychophysiological measures that tap into dimensions of attention, arousal, emotional valence, and 2) self-report measures. The psychophysiological measures include electrocardiogram (ECG), skin conductance level (SCL), facial emotional coding (FACET), and eye-tracking. The self-report measures were recognition memory, urge to smoke/vape, and smoke/vape quit intentions. The experiment is being conducted using the iMotions software platform (iMotions, 2018).<br />Attention. Attention was conceptualized as cognitive resources allocated to encoding information into short-term memory while viewing messages. Heart rate was measured as a physiological indicator of cognitive effort being allocated to the e-cig messages. Heart rate was converted to the number of average heart beats per minute (BPM) for each second of data collection. The baseline ECG signal was collected for 6 seconds prior to each message and time-locked to message exposure. During message exposure, heart rate deceleration reflects an increase in cognitive resource allocation while acceleration reflects decreased resource allocation.<br />Arousal. Arousal was conceptualized as activation of the sympathetic nervous system and was recorded with two sensors located on the medial phalange of the middle and ring fingers of the left hand.<br />Emotional valence. Emotional valence was measured with a facial action coding system (FACET). Separate positive and negative valence evidence scores were collected. The evidence number is a raw data value that is transformed to a probability between 0 and 1, where a higher value indicates a higher probability that the valence occurred.<br />Recognition memory. Recognition memory is a measure of encoding. Twelve statements/phrases were selected from messages in each message type condition and twelve foils were developed from tobacco messages not seen by participants. Each target or foil statement was presented one at a time. Participants were asked to respond whether or not they saw the statement in the messages they just saw, by pressing a key on a computer keyboard that corresponded to a “yes” or “no” response. Accuracy (hit rate) and signal detection parameters will be computed.<br />Urge to smoke/vape. Participants’ self-reported urge to smoke and vape was separately measured by using Toll, Katulak, and McKee’s (2006) five questions (e.g., I have a desire for a cigarette/e-cig right now, I have an urge for a cigarette/e-cig right now, I could control things better right now if I could smoke/vape, I would do almost anything for a cigarette/e-cig right now, and smoking/vaping would make me less depressed) via 7-point scale (ranging from 1= strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).<br />Intention to smoke/vape and intention to quit smoking/vaping. Intention to smoke and vape were separately was measured by asking “How likely are you intend to smoke(vape)/quit smoking(vaping) at a later date?” and the answers were recorded via three semantic-differential items (i.e., likely/unlikely, probable/improbable, and possible/impossible) (MacKenzie et al., 1986).<br />Stimuli<br />Print ads and PSAs used as stimuli in this study were selected in two steps. First, e-cig ads and anti-e-cig PSAs were pooled from national and statewide sponsored brand campaigns and anti-e-cig campaigns respectively from online searches. Candidate messages were selected based on the research teams’ identification for the presence and absence of the theme that depicted e-cig as an alternative to tobacco smoking and vaping cues. Next, selected 24 e-cig ads and 24 anti-e-cig PSAs were pretested to verify the presence and absence of the themes. Twelve e-cig PSAs and 12 e-cig ads were ultimately selected for the main study based on a pre-test. Three messages represented each of the four levels of alternative (present/absent) x vaping cue (present/absent) conditions.<br />Procedure<br />One-hundred adult cigarette smokers are currently being recruited via open announcement flyers and campus mass email. Each participant is run individually in a research lab located at a large mid-western university. After providing informed consent, participants see all instructions, stimuli, and questionnaire items controlled via iMotions. Participants proceed through a calibration session for eye-tracking, then see 12 messages on a 23” computer monitor. The participants were able to control the pace of the experiment via computer keys, except for message exposure, which was set at 15 sec (based on pilot testing). It takes approximately 45 min for each participant to complete the experiment. All participants were given a $20 gift card in exchange for their participation.<br />Timeline<br />Data collection is ongoing and will be finished by late January 2020. Building datasets, data cleaning, and data analyses should be completed by early March.<br /><br />References<br />Cacioppo, J. T., Gardner, W. L., & Berntson, G. G. (1999).

However, people are often engaging in more than one task while listening to the radio. This distraction might especially affect older people due to their limited cognitive capacity. Furthermore, the positivity effect in older ages challenges well-established postulates of message design, like message framing. This study investigates the influence of distraction and framing on older people’s attitudes toward a narrative radio PSA and their intention to search for further information in the context of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination. Additionally, it considers narrative engagement and psychological reactance as mediators. In a 2 × 2 online experiment, participants (<i>N<\/i> = 378) received a radio PSA with either gain- or loss-framed messages (factor 1). Half of the participants completed a distraction task while listening (factor 2). We found that the framing did not influence the dependent variables, while distraction did: Distracted participants experienced less narrative engagement than concentrated participants; lower engagement, in turn, led to higher reactance arousal, more negative attitudes, and subsequently a lower intention. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.<br />Keywords: Message framing, distraction, narrative engagement, psychological reactance, positivity effect, vaccination\n","Abstract Body: This study examined whether images of vapor and anti-smoking content in pro-vape ads elicited reactance and affected urge to vape and smoke following exposure in a mixed experimental design. Results suggest that messages that contain anti-smoking argument elicit more reactance, though there is no main effect of vapor. However, there is a marginally significant interaction between reactance and the presence or absence of vapor on urge to vape. Implications for message design are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: In our study, we aimed to synthesize two cancer-related cultural worldviews—fatalism and stigma—and three cancer-related mental conditions—cancer risk, cancer worry, and cancer fear—in examining cancer information seeking and avoidance behaviors between those with family cancer experience and those who do not. Using online survey data collected among 616 Chinese adults in Hong Kong, structural equation modeling yielded results supporting our extended model’s idea that cultural worldviews are antecedents of cancer-related mental conditions and, in turn, associated with seeking or avoiding information about cancer. We also investigated how the model changed depending on whether the adults had experienced cancer in their families. Among our results, the relationships between cancer risk and information seeking and between cancer fear and information avoidance were significant only for adults without such experience. Those findings extend current knowledge about cancer information-related behaviors by identifying cultural worldviews (i.e., fatalism and stigma) as critical distal factors of those behaviors and family cancer experience as a boundary condition for the influence of cancer risk and cancer on seeking and avoiding cancer-related information, respectively.\n","Abstract Body: Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) is the feeling that others are having better experiences one misses out on, such as social events. However, few studies have connected FOMO to health-risk behaviors, such as use of controlled substances. Further, FOMO is not well understood in terms of cognitive and affective processes. Here, we employed an online experiment at a large Midwestern University (N=219). We conducted mediation analysis to test whether upward (thoughts of hypothetical better future outcomes) or downward counterfactuals (thoughts of hypothetical worse future outcomes) mediate the relationship between FOMO and behavioral intentions and urges to vape nicotine/marijuana. Results suggest that upward counterfactuals fully mediate the positive relationship between FOMO and behavioral intentions, but downward counterfactuals do not. This research makes important contributions to theory and practice by providing an explanation of how FOMO affects unhealthy behaviors like substance use and suggests messages avoiding upward counterfactuals may increase message effectiveness.\n","Abstract Body: With the growing popularity of influencers on Instagram, the current research aimed to investigate the effects of sponsorship disclosure and type of influencers on consumer responses to Instagram post. Results showed that explicit disclosure of sponsorship induced higher persuasion knowledge, lower influencer credibility, and lower perception of the influencer’s altruistic motive, compared to no sponsorship disclosure condition. However, when sponsorship disclosure emphasized that the opinions in the post were honest and when it was perceived as highly credible, it led to higher source credibility and greater level of perceived altruistic motive of the influencer, than when there was no disclosure of sponsorship. The influencer type did not moderate the impact of sponsorship disclosure on consumer responses. <br /><i>Key words<\/i>: Sponsorship Disclosure, Persuasion Knowledge, Influencer Marketing, Social Media, Instagram<br />\n","Abstract Body: Guided by attribution theory, the current study highlights the underlying mechanism behind the credibility perception of eWOM by testing the impact of expert status and the behavioral patterns of the reviewer. A 2 (reviewer status: expert vs. non-expert) x 3 (reviewer’s behavioral pattern: high vs. medium vs. low consistency) x 2 (review valence: positive vs. negative) between-subjects posttest-only experimental design will be used. This study is expected to give guidance on how review platforms foster their expert reviewers and on what aspects they should focus on for granting an expert status.\n","Abstract Body: The academic literature about influencer communication is still scarce and rather fragmented. This is one of the first studies on social media influencer communication (SMI) that uses data mining and Natural Language Processing. Specifically, it will study: 1) How SMIs tell stories; 2) What kinds of stories SMIs tell; and 3) The relationship between SMI stories and storytelling and follower engagement. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), the latest 1000 posts of the top 22 Instagram influencers in Singapore will be analysed. However, the preliminary analysis for this extended abstract used just 60 to 100 posts from each influencer. The results partly support the first hypothesis – i.e. “rise-fall” is one of the dominant emotional arcs in the Instagram posts. The study does not support the second hypothesis that comedic and tragic arcs trigger more follower engagement (measured by the number of likes) than the other arcs. It also does not support the third hypothesis that SMIs position their audiences (rather than themselves or the brands they endorse) as the protagonists in their brand stories. The implications of these findings will be discussed in the final paper. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Influencer marketing on social media is often considered as more successful than marketing by the brand, but most studies focus exclusively on Instagram. This paper compared the effects of posts from a brand vs. an influencer on Instagram on attitude towards the brand, self-brand connection and purchase intention. Additionally, popularity of the posts (low vs. high) was varied and we explored the role of social comparison and inspiration. The results showed that popularity affected only the posts from the brand; the scores on the consumer variables were higher when popularity was lower. Although source of post and popularity did not affect social comparison and inspiration, we found that social comparison had an indirect positive effect on the consumer variables via inspiration.\n","Abstract Body: Online consumer reviews have become an indispensable part of consumers’ decision-making process.To date, several studies have investigated the effect of online product reviews, but they exclusively focused on valence (e.g., star ratings) and volume (as a proxy for popularity of the product being reviewed). Also, many studies used variables such as <i>helpfulness<\/i> or <i>usefulness<\/i> as their outcome variables in building the model to predict effectiveness of online reviews, which cannot necessarily be a realistic proxy for the actual <i>purchase. <\/i>To fill these gaps, the current study investigates the effect of review-related variables on purchase behaviors. More specifically, we develop a logit model to estimate the effects of review- and reviewer-related variables on <i>actual purchases <\/i>by linking review- and reviewer-related variables with consumers’ purchase data.\n","Abstract Body: Although political influencers on YouTube are driving change in the news and information environment, there is a lack of research examining what determines the reputation of political YouTube channels. In this research, we identify dimensions of reputation, and develop a scale, Political YouTube Channel Reputation (PYCR), to measure the dimensions. Data from 32 experts and 380 adults reveal that the PYCR scale comprises of four distinctive dimensions: true journalism, ideology, two-way communication, and quality. The reliability and validity of the scale are assessed, using exploratory and confirmatory analyses and construct validity across two studies. The PYCR scale has a variety of potential applications for political influencers, viewers, and YouTube, and it can serve as a theoretical framework for future empirical research in this emerging area.\n","Abstract Body: Social media platforms provide multiple affordances, which convey several cues to guide users in making decisions about which news to consume. Traditional factorial designs have failed to experimentally study the effects of multiple, simultaneous cues operating on social media. As a result, there is little consensus in the literature about their exact effects on news choice. In this study, we use a conjoint experimental design to examine how source outlet cues, message cues, and social endorsement cues shape news selectivity on Facebook. We find that people significantly avoid news items with out-party outlet and message cues. We also find that people select news based only on in-party messages cues, but this effect is smaller than avoidance of out-party cues. Only strong partisans demonstrate a preference for news items with in-party source and message cues. Finally, we find no evidence that social endorsement affects people’s news selection behavior.\n","Abstract Body: Two studies used causal modeling to examine the economic, psychological, and media antecedents to information searches about sexual assault. In Study 1 (<i>N<\/i>=212), economic indicators and seasonal television viewing influenced rape incidence across countries. Information searches on vivid imagery of sexual assault and rape laws mediated the effect of unemployment and GDP on rape incidence. In Study 2 (<i>TN<\/i>=142), information searches about the alleged sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh were predicted by media coverage and temporal indicators.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This reported study aims to investigate the mechanism of media switching behaviors and to predict the time people voluntarily spent on media content. An information foraging approach is proposed and empirically tested. Specifically, based on the information foraging model, the outcome variable, time spent on the current media content is expected to vary as a function of three independent variables: accessibility, availability of alternative information content value, and cost of switching. We conduct an experiment using pictures slides in a lab setting to test our hypothesis.\n","Abstract Body: Incidental news exposure on social media is regarded as passive information. However, we argue that users are actively foraging for information through cues, and we call this phenomenon incidental consumption. The current study integrated information foraging theory and curated flows framework to examine the predictors of the incidental consumption of political news on Facebook. We collected data through a mobile forced experience sampling study (N = 742) among Taiwanese college students. The findings showed that informational utility and tie strength are the main predictors and that message effects are stronger than curated effects.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Objectification research has focused on how women are evaluated and affected by emphasis on their physical appearance, particularly by men (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). What is less understood is how men are impact by and feel about viewing women, especially as this act is commonly exhibited through photos shared on social media. In an online experiment, men viewed 13 images of objectified women, non-objectified women, or neutral landscape images. Men who viewed photos of women reported higher levels of self-objectifcation and worse mood than those who viewed landscape images. Men also felt more similar to non-objectified than objectified women. Finally, men felt that women who were shared objectified photos of themselves were doing so for self-serving purposes to garner social rewards. This work builds on objectification research and provides insight into self-evaluation processes that occur as men view women’s images on social media.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates how sexually objectifying visual images interact with images of female empowerment in driving young adult women’s responses to advertising. Participants will be shown video ads that systematically vary in terms of visuals of sexual objectification and female empowerment. Cognitive and emotional processing of the advertisements will be observed through psychophysiological indicators and message outcomes will be measured with self-report scales of conscious perceptions and attitudes towards the advertisements.\n","Abstract Body: Our experiences on social networking services (SNS) can often leave us envious of others, but others’ success could be inspirational as well. This study explored how perceptions of similarity and goal attainability, as well as dispositional optimism influence the outcomes of upward social comparisons with outstanding others. Relationships among similarity, perceived goal attainability, dispositional optimism, and inspiration were tested in an experiment in which college students were exposed to a success story on SNS (<i>N<\/i> = 192). A similar comparison target whose success seemed achievable resulted in participants feeling encouraged to work harder for their future success and to set higher goals for themselves. Additionally, dispositional optimism was found to indirectly affect inspiration through increasing perceptions of goal attainability for the female participants.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: inspiration, related attribute similarity, perceived goal attainability, dispositional optimism\n","Abstract Body: Sexist humor that objectifies and stereotypes women can negatively influence recipients’ tolerance of discrimination (<i>prejudiced norm theory<\/i>) as well as cognitive performance (<i>stereotype threat theory<\/i>). This experiment examines whether the exposure to sexist comedy may influence individuals’ endorsement of benevolent sexism, leadership aspirations, and domain identification. Participants (<i>n<\/i> = 426 women and men) watched either a sexist and gender-stereotyping comedy clip or a non-sexist and non-gender-stereotyping comedy clip by the American comedian Anthony Jeselnik. The data collection for this study has been completed. Data analysis will be completed until the conference. This study adds to prior research on the impact of stereotyping and devaluing media content. The results will illuminate theory; over and above, they are important from an applied perspective.\n","Abstract Body: Health information seeking has been typically operationalized as some form of aggregate of information seeking activities such as total number of sources sought (Czaja, Manfredi, & Price, 2003), total number of content types sought (Hartoonian et al., 2014), or total time spent on information seeking (So, Kuang, & Cho, 2017; Turner, Rimal, Morrison, & Kim, 2006). While these aspects of information seeking offer a good understanding of the extent to which one engaged in information seeking in terms of depth or breadth (Niederdeppe et al., 2006), they are irrespective of the <i>type of content<\/i> individuals sought as a result of their specific information seeking goals, which may serve a crucial role as much as breadth or depth does. Information foraging theory (Pirolli & Card, 1999) is one of the very few theories that address how one searches for specific type of information but it is focused on understanding how informational cues, so called information scent (e.g., hyperlinked text), impact navigational choices rather than information seeking activities prompted by one’s need for certain types of information.<br />A number of scholars have pointed out this issue for years. For example, Miller and Jablin (1991) noted that research on information seeking has “largely omitted considerations of message content” (p. 99): Even when information seeking is measured in terms of different types of information sought, they are, more often than not, lumped together as an aggregate of information seeking activities in the end. Such conceptualization of information seeking and corresponding methodological practice obscure the potential difference in individuals who sought different types of information, since individuals who sought similar amount of information might not have sought the same exact type of information (Morrison, 1993). <br />As a response to this gap, this study first identifies distinctive information seeking patterns observed in terms of types of information one sought upon exposure to a health message. Second, this study also examines the role of health-related perceptions (e.g., susceptibility, severity) in predicting the distinctive patterns of seeking specific types of information. The following research questions are addressed in two separate experiments:<br />RQ1: What are the distinctive clusters of individuals who exhibit homogenous information seeking patterns in terms of types of information sought?<br />RQ2: Which health-related perceptions predict the distinctive patterns of information seeking (i.e., information seeker clusters)?<br />Method<br />Study 1<br />Participants (<i>N<\/i>= 927, 57.2% female, mean age = 19.87) were recruited from a research subject pool at a large public university in the U.S. and were read a health message about meningitis. After the message exposure, participant’s perceptions of susceptibility, severity, fear, anxiety, response-efficacy, and self-efficacy were measured. They were then given an opportunity to seek ten types of information about meningitis such as transmission, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Their information seeking behavior was recorded unobtrusively via <i>Qualtrics<\/i>. A total of 408 participants (44.01 %) sought at least one type of information. Since this study examines the types of information people sought, the data from participants who sought at least one type of information were used.<br />Study 2<br />            A national adult sample (<i>N <\/i>= 524, 50.19% female, mean age = 43.93) recruited through a sampling service provided by <i>Qualtrics <\/i>watched an edited version of a movie portraying a main character suffering from either Alzheimer’s Disease (“<i>Still Alice<\/i>,” <i>N<\/i> = 253) or Spinal Cancer (“<i>50/50<\/i>,” <i>N<\/i> = 271). In addition to the six predictors measured in Study 1, narrative engagement variables such as transportation, identification, perceived realism, perceived social distance, and emotional movement were also assessed in Study 2. Consistent with Study 1, after the exposure to a health narrative, participants were given an opportunity to seek various types of information about the disease the narrative concerned. A total of 398 participants (76%) sought at least one type of information provided. Data from these participants will be used in the analyses.<br />Results<br />Study 1<br />            RQ1 was addressed by identifying information-seeker clusters that exhibited homogeneous information seeking patterns in terms of types of information sought.  The data representing types of information sought were dichotomous (i.e., 0 representing skipped, 1 representing sought) for each of the ten information types. In order to measure how similar or dissimilar two individuals’ seeking patterns are, we used <i>Hamming distance<\/i>, which counts the number of disagreements between two strings of equal length. For example, if Participant A’s seeking pattern was ‘0011001111’ and Participant B’s pattern was ‘111100000’, where each of the ten digits represent whether he/she sought (1) or skipped (0) the corresponding content, then the Hamming distance between the two would be 6. Once pairwise Hamming distances for all pairs of individuals were computed, Ward’s hierarchical clustering method was used to identify three distinctive clusters of individuals with homogenous information seeking patterns. The three clusters were: Cluster 1 (31.4%), the group of participants who primarily sought “symptoms” and “transmission” information only; Cluster 2 (41.9%), the group that sought various types of information; Cluster 3 (26.7%), the group that sought “prevention” information only (see Figure 1 for the types of information primarily sought by each clusters). <br />RQ2 asked which health-related perceptions would predict the specific information seeking patterns identified. To examine the influence of the predictors on the relative odds (i.e., likelihood) of being in one cluster over another, two multinomial regression analyses, one using cluster 1 (“symptom” & “transmission”) as the reference group and the other using cluster 2 (“various types”) as the reference group, were conducted. This way, the relative odds in all pairs of three clusters (i.e., 1-2, 2-3, 1-3) can be examined. To address multicollinearity, all independent variables were centered to their means. Perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, fear, anxiety, response efficacy, and self-efficacy were entered as independent variables. <br />The results showed that perceived susceptibility significantly predicted the likelihood of belonging to “various types” relative to “symptom” & “transmission”: A person with higher perceived susceptibility was 1.49 times more likely to seek “various types” (cluster 2) relative to seeking “symptom” & “transmission” (cluster 1), EXP(B)= 1.49, <i>p<\/i> =.04.  In addition, fear was a marginally significant predictor of relative likelihood of seeking “prevention” information only in comparison to “various types”: A person with higher levels of fear had 1.24 times higher chance to seek “prevention only” (cluster 3) than “various types” (cluster 2) of information, EXP (B) = 1.242, <i>p<\/i> = .07.  None of the independent variables predicted membership to “prevention only” in comparison to “symptom” & “transmission” cluster.  This finding is consistent with extant emotion literature, which suggests fear will motivate actions that facilitate protection against the given threat, which include information about prevention (So et al., 2017).<br />Study 2<br />A parallel analysis akin to the one conducted for study1 will be conducted.<br />\n","Abstract Body: A growing trend on YouTube showcases how medical doctors post their videos and engage with a vast audience through open communication. Previous research suggests that online video content is more persuasive when framed as a narrative, but no research seems to argue that narrative videos attract more viewership. This study analyzes the association between video format (narrative v.s. non-narrative) and viewership. Non-parametric ANCOVA analyses of 25 doctor channels and their most viewed videos demonstrate that: video narrative formats may increase the reach of doctor-produced online content, both in terms of channel subscriptions and video viewership. Meta-data of doctors’ YouTube channels are also analyzed to delineate the size of the impact that medical doctors can exert on the general public through social media.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: YouTube, social media, doctor channel, narrative paradigm, medical practice promotion, health videos\n","Abstract Body: Please see the Extended Abstract\n","Abstract Body: The present study explored the effects of self-affirmation and psychological distance on perceptions (i.e., threat and efficacy) about facing climate change, and participants' responses to a climate change message (i.e., reactance, message derogation, attitudes, and behavioral intentions). Participants (N = 298) recruited from an online Amazon MTurk panel were randomly assigned into one of four conditions crossing self-affirmation (yes vs. no) and psychological distance (large vs. small). Results suggest that self-affirmation reduced perceptions of freedom threat and counterarguing. The ecological world view, political orientation, and moral obligations moderated the effects of self-affirmation. Climate change threat messages framed as psychologically distant rather than close induced higher threat perceptions, more cognitive appraisal, and less message derogation. No significant interaction was found between self-affirmation and psychological distance on measured variables. The observed effects were discussed in light of the sleeper effect and self-affirmation manipulation itself. Limitations and implications were also discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: School readiness skills upon entering kindergarten are critical for children’s success later in life. Yet many parents, especially parents from under-resourced communities, lack an understanding of their role as their child’s first educator. Public media-based interventions are a fruitful way to bring interventions into the communities that need them, and likely effect change not only by teaching content but by influencing the norms and attitudes towards the target behavior. This pre-post quasi-experimental study utilized the Reasoned Action Approach to evaluate a community intervention program that is designed to equip at-risk parents (<i>n<\/i>=43) with skills they can use to support their young children’s school readiness. Findings suggest that the program had a strong effect on participants’ subjective norms. Qualitative data also showed that parents felt they had gained more skills and confidence as a result of participating in the program. Implications for community interventions are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Much of the extant research on green advertising has looked at appeals and the effects of individual differences, but what if another factor was influencing appeal saliency? Using self-construal theory (Markus & Kitayama, 1991) and the Persuasion Knowledge Model (Friestad & Wright, 1994), we propose that the use of social media (compared to a news website) will cause consumers’ relationship to others to be heightened, and alternate self-construal will occur, thus causing different green appeals to be effective for distinct reasons. We experimentally test how advertising influences purchase intention and attitude change when the appeal focuses on the benefits of the product (self), the environment (other), or a combination of both (hybrid). This initial study confirmed our hypotheses, and we will conduct a second experiment to further validate and find boundary conditions for our proposed effects.\n","Abstract Body: Despite infrequent false allegations of university-related sexual assault (2-10%; Lisak, Gardinier, Nicksa, & Cote, 2010), it is often a sad case of he said/she said. We manipulated faux online news article of an alleged sexual assault to assess how readers’ perceptions of blame and consent depend on the female accuser’s and the male accused’s sobriety, plus his status.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Internet users navigate a high-choice environment, in which they regularly encounter news content, either by directly accessing news websites or incidentally on social media. Thus, they have to make many decisions about which news items they want to read or otherwise engage with. While the factors, which influence these decisions are relatively well studied, the underlying cognitive processes are not. In this study, we build on a generic dual-systems framework to explain the role cognitive effort plays in Internet users’ news decision-making. We employ eye tracking to measure changes in pupil size during decision-making, which indicate cognitive activity. Our results show that users only apply little effort in their decision-making. Further results, limitations, and implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Public debate as civility has long been considered a valued indicator of functioning democratic principles (Papacharissi, 2004), yet civility of the comments remains as one of the most pressing challenges in online comments as an information system for journalists and media organizations (Su et al., 2018). While anonymous commenting might safeguard an expression of multiple voices in online spaces viewed as a new Habermasian public sphere, notwithstanding the challenges (see e.g. Zamith & Lewis, 2014), at the same time, anonymity in online settings has been found fostering disinhibition (Suler, 2004) or even abuse (Lavender and Anderson, 2009), and toxic online behavior (see e.g. Lapidot-Lefler & Barak, 2012). Thus, it can be hypothesized that people who post anonymously, are likely to be posting more antagonistic comments. Moreover, previous studies show that partisan media, especially conservative media, exhibit more traits of antagonistic language (Sobieraj and Berry, 2011), which could be facilitated by anonymous posting.  Finally, anonymity goes beyond antagonistic online subculture (Barnes 2018; Phillips, 2015). Posting by masking IP addresses in the comments in online news portals has been linked to an organized foreign influence, otherwise known as Russian trolls (see Zelenkauskaite & Balduccini, 2017).  <br />This study is interested in the publicness of communication—which is the opposite of anonymous or private posting—by analyzing far-right online news portal Breitbart. To what degree are democratic public discourse ideals are fulfilled by choosing information system’s publicness settings to leave comments to online news stories? Depending on the ‘weightiness’ of the topic of a news story, do users decide to comment on them publicly or privately? Are comments more “liked” if they are public? This study treats news portals as sociotechnical information systems—where comments are spaces in which users shape technology for their needs (Sawyer & Tapia, 2007), i.e. for users to choose the level of “openness” through privacy settings. Openness in this study is conceptualized as public posting. Publicness is operationalized as a setting one’s profile as being ‘public’, enabled by sociotechnical affordances of the DISQUS commenting platform.<br />\n","Abstract Body: New public diplomacy (NPD) by \"\"civilian diplomats\"\" is an emerging phenomenon in the present digital and globalized era but is less empirically studied. This study will investigate the influence of online news consumption, intrapersonal reflection, interpersonal political deliberation and NPD awareness on intention of NPD (Cho et al., 2009; Snow, 2010).<br />While public diplomacy (PD) suggests distribution of “ideas, ideals, and policies” to foreign public by governmental actors through mass media and social media so as to construct understanding and common points among nations and cultures, and fulfil national goals and interests (Sharp, 2005; Wang, 2005), NPD emphasizes the empowerment of the Internet and social media that enables non-governmental actors, which include non-governmental organizations (NGO), enterprises, celebrities and ordinary individuals, to share information and thoughts on political issues and public affairs of their own countries with foreign publics (Khatib et al., 2012; Park & Lim, 2014). PD and NPD share a development communication perspective that suggests an ultimate goal of opinion change of foreign public and their differences on communication process have been compared (Pamment, 2015). However, most of the studies focused on NPD by organizational actors such as NGOs and terrorist organizations while alternative communicators such as individual actors are less discussed (Sarvestani, Ameli, & Izadi, 2019; Yang, Wang, & Wang, 2017).<br />NPD participation includes 5 components, which are “listening, advocacy, cultural diplomacy, exchange diplomacy and international news broadcasting” (Cull, 2008) and features “publics-to-publics (P2P) transmission; unofficial/non-governmental; active and participatory public; dialogic and exchange orientation–two-way symmetric communication; generally more long-term in reference to behavioral change; and based on relationship, systems, and network theories” (Snow, 2010) and scholars have argued that a paradigm shift to participatory communication occurs in the field of NPD as it involves active participants (Pamment, 2015). To fill in the gap of literature, this study explores the participatory communication of NPD by examining the factors of intention of NPD based on the Orientation – Stimulus – Reasoning – Orientation – Response (O-S-R-O-R) model.<br />The O-S-R-O-R is an integrative model that suggests how communicative and cognitive factors influence participation (second R) and mediate between pre-existing “structural, cultural, cognitive, and motivational characteristics” (first O) and participation ( McLeod et al., 1994; Shah et al., 2007). Stimulus (S) refers to information consumption such as media usage, political attention, and news and ads exposure. The second O represents cognitive outcomes resulted from media stimulus such as political efficacy, political trust, and political satisfaction (Chan, 2016; Xia & Shen, 2018). Moreover, the O-S-R-O-R model was developed from the O-S-O-R model when scholars found that reasoning (first R in O-S-R-O-R) process, during which information is understood, refined, and elaborated through intrapersonal or interpersonal deliberation, can mediate between media exposure and cognitive outcomes (Shah et al.,2007). Since the model focuses on the effects of information exposure, consumption, reflection and exchange, which all require engagement and proactiveness, on participation, we think it is applicable for studying NPD.<br />As for theoretical framework (see Firgure 1), the first O consists of two independent variables which are political interest and intercultural communicating willingness and the stimulus is consumption of online news on politics and public affairs (An & Fang, 2016; Cho et al., 2009; Holt, Shehata, Strömbäck, & Ljungberg, 2013; Lupia & Philpot, 2005). Intrapersonal reflection and interpersonal political deliberation are considered as two variables of reasoning section and NPD awareness is examined as the cognitive outcome (An & Fang, 2016; Cho et al., 2009; Li & Chan, 2017).<br /><br />Figure 1. Theoretical framework<br /><br /><br />This study conducts both online survey and semi-structured interviews. The online survey has been conducted by snowball sampling through social media in China. The questionnaire was created on Qualtrics and distributed from March 28th to April 2nd in 2019. Each respondent received online red pocket as the reward for participation after finishing the survey. Among the 400 responses that we received, 89 of them were invalid so that the size of the final sample for analysis is 311. Three criteria were used to identify invalid responses: (a) finished the survey in less than 1.5 minutes, (b) constantly selected the same option for different questions, (c) inconsistently answered different questions that measured the same variable.<br />All the independent and dependent variables were measured based on the 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). The items for measurement are listed in Table 1. Control variables include gender, age, and educational background (see Table 2). Structural equation modeling will be conducted by Mplus 8 to examine the model fit and analyze the mediating effects of online news consumption, reflection, political deliberation and NPD awareness within the mechanism of NPD intention.<br />As the results from the survey are generalized in nature, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to further explore certain parts of the mechanism of NPD and the question lists will be formulated based on the results of data analysis.<br />Theoretical contributions of this study include: Firstly, as the definition of NPD is still uncertain because of its interdisciplinary nature, this study can help clarify the concept. Secondly, exploring the communication process of NPD by ordinary individuals, which is much less studied before, can complement the literature of NPD. Thirdly, by conducting surveys and interviews, empirical evidence for NPD can be provided. Fourthly, the research boundary of the O-S-R-O-R model can be extended into the field of NPD and the model validity can be tested. Fifthly, based on the O-S-R-O-R model, this study can reveal the influence of information processing (i.e., online news consumption, intrapersonal reflection and interpersonal political deliberation) as well as cognition (i.e., NPD awareness) on NPD intention.<br /><br />Table 1 Descriptive statistics of control variables<br /><br />Table 2 Measurements of independent and dependent variables\n","Abstract Body: Online news comments are prominent feature on most news sites, and it has drawn many scholars’ interests. Studies show comments affect perceptions of news or the associated media product. However, one area of research in particular has been sorely lacking: examination of <i>comment source <\/i>effects. In this regard, <i>commenter gender <\/i>can present interesting insights about commenter sources effects. Gender is an important source attribute, and past research suggests it can impact content perception. This study thus examines the effects of commenter <i>gender, <\/i>conceptualizing it as a heuristic cue that can affect content perceptions above and beyond the actual content attributes, following Sundar's MAIN Model (2008). Using the same model, we also seek to illuminate potential mechanisms underlying gender cue effects, via the elicitation of <i>authority heuristics<\/i>. Moreover, the study also seeks to examine how individual difference variables (<i>news media literacy<\/i>)<i> <\/i>can impact commenter gender’s effects.\n","Abstract Body: Extended Abstract<br />The carryover effect of preceding emotional content has been of interest to media researchers. Excitation transfer theory (Zillmann, 1971; Zillmann, Katcher, & Milavsky, 1972) suggests that an arousing experience will carry over to intensify the emotional response to subsequent stimuli. More recently, Wang and Lang (2012) noted that the activation and decay of dual motivational systems function as the mechanisms underlying excitation transfer theory.<br />The LC4MP framework (Lang, 2006, 2000) argues that mediated portrayals are initially responded as real and thus, elicit automatic motivational activation in human brains and thereby give rise to emotional experience. Once motivational systems are activated, they take time to gradually diminish until reaching the resting level affecting advertising recognition and recall, as well as product attitude and purchase intention (Wang & Lang, 2012; Potter, LaTours, Braun-LaTour, & Reichert, 2006). Building on the Wang and Lang (2012) findings, it has been proposed that the spillover effect can be explained as function of motivational activation decay and memory consolidation process (Yegiyan, 2015). The consolidation process for the encoded information from preceding emotional content may be concurrent with and interfere with the subsequent information processing (Yegiyan, 2015).<br />To extend these findings, we designed a study to test the function of the dual motivational system in understanding the mechanism with the spillover effect of preceding positive and negative arousing content on participant’s self-reported evaluation of how quickly time passed while viewing subsequent images and the recognition and free recall of those images.<br /><br />Method<br />Sample<i>.<\/i> A total of 40 individuals were recruited from Northern Taiwan. The average age was 24.58 (SD = 3.53), ranging from 20 to 34 years old; more females (72.5%) than males (27.5%). All participants had no experience viewing the materials in stimuli and had never participated in any similar experiments before.<br />Design and Procedure. A 2 (Arousal: High vs. low) x 2 (Valence: Positive vs. negative) mixed-factors design was applied in this study. Subjects were assigned randomly to one of two between-subject conditions (high arousal or low arousal). In either condition, participants were requested to evaluate 20 images (10 from positive valence and 10 from negative valence), which were presented to the viewers randomly.<br />Once arriving at the laboratory, a consent form was presented and signed by the participants. Next, participants were given practice for evaluating an image so that they can get familiar with the procedure of the main experiment, which was administered via Qualtrics and iMotions. After the evaluation of 20 images, participants needed to complete a questionnaire on the passage of time, time evaluation, numbers of images, free recall, recognition, and demographics. The duration of total time for the experiments lasted 20-30 minutes and participants obtained NT$100 (US$3.5) as compensation for participation.<br />Stimuli and Materials. Four sets of images were selected from the database of the International Affective Picture System (Lang, Bradley, & Cuthbert, 1997) to cover a variation of different levels of arousal and valence value, with 10 high arousal positive, 10 high arousal negative, 10 low arousal positive, and 10 low arousal negative. Meanwhile, there were additional 20 images selected from each category (HAPV, HANV, LAPV, and LANV) as distractors for recognition.<br />Measures. For the evaluation of each image consisted of three questions: the levels of interest, arousal, and valence. After rating the images, assessment of time, images, memory and demographic questionnaire were included.<br /><i>Evaluation of images. <\/i>Participants were asked to examine the levels of interest through self-reported measures on a 9-point Liker scale (<i>1 = not interest at all, 7 = extremely interest<\/i>). For the perceived arousal and valence, a 9-point Self Assessment Manikin (SAM) was applied from Bradley and Lang (1994). Participants were requested to give a lower rating for arousal when they felt calm and a higher score when excited after viewing an image, whereas participants were asked to assess valence by giving a lower score for feeling sad or unhappy, and a higher score if they felt happy or positive toward an image.<br /><i>The passage of time judgments.<\/i> On a scale of 0 to 100 (<i>0 = time dragged on, 100 = time flew by<\/i>) participants indicated the passage of time while evaluating the images (Sucala, Scheckner, & David, 2001) by responding to “How quickly time seemed to pass when you were evaluating the images?”<br /><i>Assessment of time and images.<\/i> After rating 20 images, two items were included to evaluate the perceived time spent and numbers of images they had rated. For the self-report time assessment (Wearden, 2005), participants were asked “Provide your best estimation of how much time you spent in rating images?” For the numbers of images, subjects were asked “How many images did you see during the period of image evaluation?”<br /><i>Memory. <\/i>Free recall and recognition were included to examine the extent of information that can be remembered or retrieved. An open-end question asked participants to recall the images and list anything they can remember. For recognition, a set of 40 images were presented (20 true targets and 20 false targets) and the participants were requested to provide a Yes or No judgments for each item.<br />Results<br />Manipulation check<i>.<\/i> A <i>t<\/i>-test was used to ensure the participants perceived two different levels of arousal (high vs. low). The test confirmed that participants in the high arousal condition (<i>M<\/i> = 6.43, <i>SD<\/i> = .75), perceived significantly higher arousal from images than in the low arousal condition (<i>M<\/i> = 4.37, <i>SD<\/i> = 1.43; <i>t<\/i> = 5.63, <i>p<\/i> < .001).<br />Time assessment<i>. <\/i>The average of actual time spent for rating images was 157.16 (<i>SD <\/i>= 45.25) seconds, whereas the average for perceived time spent was 554.48 (<i>SD <\/i>= 593.74). For the assessment of the numbers of images, the average was 17.35 (<i>SD<\/i> = 5.16). To understand the time assessment between high and low arousal, results of t-Test indicated that the numbers of images was reported higher in high arousal (<i>M<\/i> = 19.15, <i>SD<\/i> = 5.59) than in low arousal (<i>M<\/i> = 15.55, <i>SD<\/i> = 4.08; <i>t<\/i> = 2.33, <i>p<\/i> < .05). That is, participants in high arousal perceived more work done and provided a more accurate estimation of the numbers of images they saw. However, there was no significant difference between high and low arousal on actual time spent (<i>M<\/i> = 155.37 < 158.95, <i>t<\/i> = -.247, <i>p<\/i> > .05) and the perceived time spent (<i>M<\/i> = 424.90 < 684.05, <i>t<\/i> = -1.394, <i>p<\/i> >.05).<br />For passage of time judgments, the <i>t<\/i>-Test showed that there was significant effect on passage of time judgments (<i>t<\/i> =12.37, <i>p<\/i> < .001). Participants felt time flew by in high arousal (<i>M<\/i> = 61.35, <i>SD<\/i> = 20.79) and those in low arousal perceived time dragged (<i>M<\/i> = 2.6, <i>SD<\/i> = 4.38).<br />Memory assessment. Although there was no significant on total free recall between high and low arousal (<i>t<\/i> =-.258, <i>p<\/i> > .05), the results of <i>t<\/i>-Test revealed that participants in low arousal (<i>M<\/i> = 6.20, <i>SD<\/i> = 1.11) recalled positive images greater than in high arousal (<i>M<\/i> = 4.45, <i>SD<\/i> = 2.09; <i>t<\/i> = -3.311 <i>p<\/i> < .01). Interestingly, participants in high arousal (<i>M<\/i> = 6.10, <i>SD<\/i> = 2.05) recalled negative images greater than in low arousal (<i>M<\/i> = 4.6, <i>SD<\/i> = 1.76; <i>t<\/i> = 2.48 <i>p<\/i> < .05).<br />For recognition, two scores were calculated: recognition sensitivity and recognition criterion bias. The analysis of <i>t<\/i>-Test indicated that the recognition sensitivity was greater in high arousal (<i>M<\/i> = .23, <i>SD<\/i> = .017) than in low arousal (<i>M<\/i> = .22, <i>SD<\/i> = .001; <i>t<\/i> = 2.70 <i>p<\/i> < .001). The same result was found in criterion bias (<i>t<\/i> = 2.59, <i>p<\/i> > .001), that is to say, people in high arousal have greater strength and bias of recognition than in low arousal. The result showed that high arousal images could cause people to retrieve information easily but be less willing to recall information in memory (see Table 1).<br />\n","Abstract Body: One common mental strategy readers may use to understand story characters is egocentric projection—projecting one’s own mental processes onto the mind of the character. The current research explores the circumstances under which audience members understand a character’s mental states by egocentric projection. Through two experiments (N=475), we examined the impacts of familiarity with the character, valence of the story, and affective disposition toward the character on egocentric projection. The results support theories indicating that egocentric projection is most likely for unfamiliar and liked characters. These studies also explored the relationship between egocentric projection and people’s engagement with narratives and shed light on the mechanism of narrative processing.\n","Abstract Body: In a retrospective survey evaluating responses to popular feature films, we investigate the role of three novel constructs in regard to eudaimonic content of entertainment media: (1) salience of the human condition, which refers to the idea that life is often mixed bag, but experiencing the ups and downs is what leads to an enriching and meaningful life; (2) ability to make sense of difficulties, which is proposed as an outcome of exposure to eudaimonic media content; and (3) emotional range, which refers to the range or number of emotions experienced during media exposure. Results indicate that more eudaimonic films can increase individuals’ ability to make sense of difficult situations in their lives, as well as increase the motivation to pursue meaningful goals, such as being a better person. These outcomes were strongly mediated by salience of the human condition, feelings of elevation. Additionally, the extent to which participants’ values matched those portrayed in a film is shown to be an important aspect of both more eudaimonic and more hedonic films. Finally, more eudaimonic films tend to elicit a wider range of emotional responses, which increases feelings of appreciation. Overall, this study contributes to a broader understanding of what constitutes eudaimonic or hedonic media and the theoretical mechanisms that explain the positive effects of eudaimonic films. Implications of these findings and future directions for the study of entertainment media are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Many narrative engagement constructs are believed to be variable processes that can vary in both intensity and duration.  Despite this, previous research into narrative persuasion has relied almost exlcusively on self-report measures assessd after exposure. In an attempt to overcome this limitation, we utilize eye-tracking technology as a means of measuring perspective taking with a narrative character.  Our expectation is that perspective taking will predict attitudes in line with those espoused by the character.\n","Abstract Body: Spoilers (i.e., premature information about media content) influence anticipated enjoyment and other aspects of audiences’ appraisal of entertainment. However, little is known about what influences spoiler selection and avoidance. An experiment allowed participants to select between spoiler and spoiler-free reviews after watching a movie trailer. We examined the role of perceived content challenge, self-control and trait variables as predictors of spoiler selection and spoilers’ subsequent impact on anticipated enjoyment, anticipated appreciation and intention to watch.<br />\n","Abstract Body: One element of public discourse highly shaped by social media is the Black Lives Matter movement, which has been fueled by the rapid and wide dissemination of video evidence of unnecessary use of force by police against citizens of color. One of the main reasons these pieces of information are shared more widely and quickly is that they are negative in valence; individuals tend to comment on and share negative information more, especially when it is extreme. This project examined how camera angle and skin tone of the citizen being harmed affected not only emotional responses but also how likely viewers were to comment on and share the videos in their social media feeds. Further, we examined what types of comments they leave.  As expected, when videos depicted police violence against likely racial ingroup members, individuals felt more negative and were more likely to comment and share. These findings have important implications for how policing videos are perceived and discussed in the public discourse. Point of view interacts with other important factors to influence how individuals make judgements about violent interactions between police and citizens.\n","Abstract Body: This study proposed and tested the notion that the emotion spillover effect depends on the level of motivational relevance of both the preceding and the subsequent message content. Physiological and self-reported data were collected to test predictions. The results showed that perceived importance affected heart rate change pattern as well as recognition performance for the subsequent message. This suggested that perceived importance could be conceptualized as a motivational factor since it could elicit orienting responses and modulate resource allocation between subsequent message processing and the concurrent memory consolidation of preceding emotional content. Furthermore, the results indicated that perceived importance became a more significant factor in resource allocation when messages followed calm rather than arousing content. This indirectly suggested that emotional content was a stronger predictor of how cognitive resources were allocated. <br />\n","Abstract Body: “How to”-videos on YouTube have become a popular source for procedural learning. An important difference to traditional educational videos is that the protagonist is in most cases not a professional teacher. Building on work on social learning from models, this paper explores the role of the protagonist by looking at model-observer similarity, source credibility and conversational human voice as protagonist variables. A survey (n = 401) among active Internet users was conducted. The majority has used YouTube and has watched “How to”-videos on YouTube. Respondents preferred videos with protagonists that they perceived as experts and trustworthy, and who talked in a conversational human voice. Protagonists of the same sex were also preferred, especially by males. The protagonist variables explained variance in perceived usefulness and intention to use “How to”-videos above and beyond the technical and instructional quality of the video. However, only conversational human voice and same sex of the protagonist turned out as significant predictors of perceived usefulness and intention to use.\n","Abstract Body: When users are being tracked on social media all the time, they develop elevated privacy concerns as losing online privacy means losing control of personal life. Guided by Marshall McLuhan’s media ecology theory, this study assesses the factors contributed to internet privacy concern (IPC) in social media users from the United States and China (<i>N<\/i> = 1,340). A significant correlation between social media power use and IPC was identified, which was moderated by respondents’ cultural background. It also found a generation gap concerning IPC between people growing up with social media as a dominant media platform and those who did not. Those aged 18-25 had significantly lower IPC than those aged 50+. The findings expand McLuhan’s media ecology theory by providing new support to it in terms of the impact of dominant media technology (i.e., social media) on societal perceptions (i.e., IPC) in a cross-cultural setting.\n","Abstract Body: Despite a large number of studies focusing on how individual characteristics affect privacy management behavior, little research have carefully examined the role of privacy literacy. This paper measured SNS user’s privacy literacy in two different ways - self assessment for stated literacy versus true-false test for actual knowledge, to investigate discrepancy of the two kinds of literacy and how this discrepancy related to privacy concerns, attitude toward protective measures, and willingness to self-disclosure. With the sample of 404 SNS users from mainland China, our results revealed irrelevance of stated and actual privacy literacy, positive relation of attitude on protective measures and privacy concerns, and negative relation of privacy concerns and self-disclosure. Furthermore, findings indicated that, the more SNS users overestimated their privacy literacy, the weaker intention they had to self-disclosure. This correlation was mediated by their attitude toward protective measures as well as privacy concerns, with overestimation for privacy literacy positively affecting their concerns for privacy and then negatively translated into information sharing willingness. On the contrary, underestimation for privacy literacy was correlated to much information disclosure, which indicated that self-disclosure might not be as dangerous as previous research argued before.\n","Abstract Body: Technologies are increasingly evolving, and over time more digital platforms emerge. As Gillespie (2010) argues, these platforms consider themselves as ‘platforms’ because they have pre-thought out aims and goals to achieve with the help of their audiences and users. These platforms use their users’ most basic information to be able to provide them with curated content that meets their needs, which in turn makes more profit for them. However, the potential uses of user data benefit such companies in ways that may not be visible to users. Recently, literacy is becoming increasingly important within the capacity to understand and control one’s personal data. The evolution of digital technology has changed the way people interact with one another. The internet, which was first used to store information, has become a way for people to connect in a virtual environment (Hamilton, 2015). Therefore, it is essential for users to understand and be aware of the critical stances of their data in terms of how and why it is used (Pangrazio and Selwyn, 2018). Lately, traditional concerns over supporting the development of ‘digital literacy’ are now being usurped by concerns over citizens’ ‘data literacies’ (Pangrazio and Selwyn, 2018). However, there is little research exploring the relationships between different digital literacy and sharing information practices. It has not been sufficiently investigated yet whether individuals prefer sharing information over their privacy; whether individuals better engage with and perceive of the information sharing online when they are better digitally literate; whether data/information literacies moderate the relationships between sharing information practices and awareness of privacy and data uses of online platforms companies. An online survey of university students (aged 19 to 30) was conducted to examine the different levels of literacy in terms of data, information, technology and social media literacy and how that affects in the differences in concerns about privacy and personal data use of online platforms. The survey link was disseminated via student bulletins and students group communities on Facebook and further with the help of instructions (tutors/ lecturers) who are teaching in the university in class or via emails. In total, 200 samples were used for the analysis in this study. The survey compromises demographics, digital technology and online platform usage, digital literacy (information, data, social media literacies), awareness/concerns of data privacy and digital trust.<br />As a result, our correlation shows different relationships between different digital literacy, awareness and concerns of data privacy and digital trust. The underlying assumption was that if a user has higher levels of digital skills, it is more likely that he or she will have a higher degree of awareness and concerns of data privacy. In particular, the understanding content dimension of digital literacy was positively related to the awareness of information sharing and privacy, showing those who have a higher degree of understanding of online content, such as identifying prejudice or bias in media and discerning reliable information, are more likely to be aware of data privacy online. Also, the frequent engagement with information searching and interacting with others on social media was positively associated with higher levels of awareness. In terms of digital trust, information and system quality are positively related to trust in online platforms. That is, those who have a higher degree of perception of information completeness and accuracy towards online are more likely to trust in apps and platforms. While there is no significant correlation between digital literacy and digital trust, the three dimensions of digital literacy were positively associated with the perception of information and system quality. The ability to navigate, analyse, and participate in various activities online was significantly related to an understanding of information completeness and accuracy online, which in turn affects digital trust. The results of data analysis in this study highlights the significance of digital literacy in understanding the online system and data privacy, which ultimately contributes to increasing digital trust as a whole.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Video blogging (vlogging) has become an emerging form of digital cultural production on platforms such as YouTube (Bishop, 2018). Though many studies have used theoretical lens such as parasocial relationship (PSR) and parasocial interaction (PSI) to examine relationship building between vloggers and viewers, ambiguities exist in terms of the nature of such relationships in today’s social media environment. Many efforts have been made to adapt PSR to examine relationship-building on social media; however, there is still a lack of nuanced understanding of the mechanism underlying such process. In this paper, I first explicate a set of similar yet confusing concepts such as PSR and PRI, intimacy and interaction. Second, I discuss the boundary conditions to synthesize these concepts and provide a revised view of PSR as a two-way, interactive relationship in the vlog context. Third, through a synthesis of literature across Social Penetration Theory (SPT) and PSR, I propose a set of theoretical arguments that incorporate<i> reciprocal intimacy<\/i> as a mediator between self-disclosure and its relational output—<i>perceived interconnectedness<\/i>—in the vlog context. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. This paper hopes to shed light on the bi-directional, interactive nature of the relationship that is co-constructed by vloggers and viewers. This offers future directions worthy of empirical examination and has practical implications for vlog marketing.\n","Abstract Body: To delve into the role of the sender of advertising information on Facebook, this study attempts to examine whether individuals’ responses to advertising post is influenced by their perception of social distance of the advertising sender, drawing upon the Construal Level Theory (CLT: Trope & Liberman, 2003; 2010). Our study reveals that toward the advertising shared by their Facebook friend (vs. shared by a brand), individuals elicit more positive attitude toward the information and the brand and show higher eWOM intentions. Considering the fit effect of psychological distance and ad appeal, we expected the individuals will generate more positive responses to the advertising post when the social distance (distant vs. close) fits the appeal type (benefit vs. attribute). However, there was no interaction between social distances and ad appeal type. Therefore, in SNS environments in which individuals’ attitudes towards consumption activities are influenced by peer-to-peer communication through social interaction (Wang et al., 2012), social distance towards the sender of the ad was found to be a key factor that enhance advertising effectiveness on SNSs. Particularly, social distance, regardless of the message appeal, significantly influenced attitudes towards the persuasion object and eWOM intention on SNSs.\n","Abstract Body: Knowledge contribution on online knowledge-sharing platforms has long been considered instrumental behavior performed based on utilitarian considerations. We used cognitive evaluation theory and analyzed users’ behavior metrics to understand the underlying factors of why some users continue to contribute their knowledge for a long time while others quickly drop out. We found that involvement in learning activities was an important indicator of intrinsic motivation to maintain knowledge contribution behaviors. Furthermore, online learning activities mediated the widely known effects of social rewards in increasing the duration of knowledge contribution. We conclude that there is a self-reinforcement mechanism in the reciprocal relationship between learning activity and social rewards that governs continuous online knowledge contribution behavior.\n","Abstract Body: As innovation is increasingly generated via crowdsourcing, how to enable the crowd to integrate their knowledge and thus find innovative solutions remains unclear. This paper advances information systems literature on crowdsourcing for innovation by examining how members of online crowd collectively generate integrative and innovative knowledge. In particular, it tests the differential main effects as well as the interaction effects of knowledge diversity and centralized network position on the crowdsourced production of innovation and knowledge integration. Analyzing 21 organization-sponsored online crowdsourcing open challenges, two studies were conducted based on 3,200 unique posts generated by 486 participants. Findings showed that when knowledge contributors occupy a centralized position in the networked communication, they are less likely to generate integrative and innovative knowledge; and the benefits obtained from the exposure to others’ shared diverse knowledge tend to be mitigated by being centralized in online collaboration. Theoretically, this research extends the theory of perspective taking by incorporating the impacts of network position into studying crowdsourcing innovation challenges, as well as demonstrates a crowd-based mechanism of generating integrative knowledge. Practically, this paper suggests that crowdsourcing practitioners should design and implement platforms that can promote the diversity of crowd members’ explicitly shared knowledge without centralizing certain knowledge contributors.\n","Abstract Body: Online fan communities are a new form of organization that are devoid of formal organizational structure or membership. However, it remains unclear how online fan communities manage to organize themselves, particularly in times of an external shock. The study examined the response from an online fan community to a celebrity scandal on Sina Weibo. Applying automated text analysis, we compared the volume, valence and content of an online community (82,739 posts from 2,813 fans) before and after the smoking scandal of TFBoys member Roy Wang. The findings demonstrate that online communities are able to coordinate their strategies to shift public opinions during the celebrity’s public relation crisis. Yet celebrity scandals also poses a significant challenge to the community’s self-organization as they are detrimental to group cohesion and collective sentiments. Nevertheless, online fan communities are highly resilient and adaptive: their emotions quickly recovered and they promptly restored group cohesion and coordination after the scandal.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The purpose of this study is to examine whether Instagram brand communities could enhance perceived organizational authenticity and reputation, and whether membership of Instagram brand community would make a difference.Findings from a 2 (brand community membership: members vs non-members) x 2 (social presence: high vs low) x 2 (conversational human voice: high vs low) x 4 (multiple messages using four brands) factorial design suggests that Instagram brand community members have significantly higher perceptions of authenticity and organizational reputation compared to those who are not part of the community. Further, being an Instagram brand community member moderated the effect of social presence on perceptions of authenticity.\n","Abstract Body: Extending the common logic associated with public goods theories, this study reframes the conceptual dichotomy that traditionally classifies individuals as either free riders or contributors and builds on theory that treats both questions and answers as important resources in providing public information goods. Bighash et al. (2018) define individuals who participate often as <i>maintainers<\/i> of public information goods, and those who contribute infrequently or only once as <i>visitors<\/i> of public information goods. From this perspective, no one is classified as a free rider. Individuals are instead reclassified based on their their question- and/or answer-contributions over time rather than at any one point in time. We extend this empirically by determining who is a maintainer and who is a visitor in an online community. Specifically, those who retain or increase their level of contributions from one time point to the next are considered the <i>maintainers<\/i>. <i>Visitors<\/i> are those who decrease their contributions from one time point to the next. We detail the Stackoverflow data, preliminary results, and future analysis.\n","Abstract Body: <br />The social context of eating plays a significant role in influencing individuals’ eating decisions. However, how social eating cues are processed in health promotion messages is unclear. This study examined individuals’ psychophysiological responses to different types of eating cues in PSA contexts. Results suggested that the presence of a group of people eating, versus one person, created greater attention and arousal, which likely serve cross-purposes to those intended in the messages.\n","Abstract Body: This study aims to examine how social media start age and amount of use influence the persuasion process for social media users including social media natives who begin using social media in early ages i.e., between 8-17 years old. By carrying out an online experiment, this study compares combinatory features of online information such as interactivity (e.g., social media or website), modality (e.g., video or picture with text), and endorser (e.g., peer or specialist). This study found that the more social media use impact on a sense of non-mediation with the endorser and also social media early start age associates with a better media effect e.g., an attitude of introduced content, evaluation on the endorser, intention to share the content with others, and topic related interest. Also, the peer’s endorsement has increased the feeling of direct conversation as well as the media effect. However, the results also show that the social media natives who began using social media at an early age i.e., social developmental stages, feel a less social presence from the endorser. It implies that social media start age is an important distinction as to who could empathize with others. This result expands the discussion regarding the new generation called, ‘social media natives.’\n","Abstract Body: This study began with concerns about mis-/disinformation in the new media environment and how to combat it. We developed an online educational game designed to help young adults become information literate citizens, and examined its effect on skepticism toward online information and information literacy skills. In an online experiment, a total of 210 participants between 20 and 29 years of age were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the game (<i>Trustme!<\/i>) group, the quiz group treated with no additional game element, and the control group that does not get any intervention. A two-way ANOVA revealed that the participants who played the game demonstrated higher information literacy levels compared to the participants in the control group. In addition, there was a significant treatment effect × civic skills level interaction effect. That is, the participants in the game group showed a significantly higher level of information literacy skills than those in the control group and the quiz group only when their civic skills was low. However, in terms of skepticism, there was no main effect for civic skills or treatment, and no interaction effect[A1] was found. Discussions follow.\n","Abstract Body: Particulate matter (PM) causes many health risks such as premature death in people with heart and decreased lung function (Kim et al., 2014). Although public health agencies take effort on delivering PM information via their websites, PM is not considered as a serious risk (Choi, 2018). In order to make individuals feel comfortable toward those websites, this study examines the effects of interactivity and message processing on a website.\n","Abstract Body: From films like The Sound of Music to white noise generators, auditory stimuli have always played an important role in shaping and defining our media experiences. More recently, curated or created soundscapes have been found to cause autonomous sensory meridian responses (ASMR) – a pleasurable sensation akin to tingles or shivers starting from the crown of the head or the base of the neck. Numerous communities have developed around the popular video sharing website, YouTube, dedicated to the creation, enjoyment, and curation of videos containing ASMR facilitating content. Despite its proliferation, few studies have investigated ASMR phenomena, much less the underlying processes by which ASMR is created and experienced. This paper aims to further our understanding of ASMR as a potential media effect by developing and testing a taxonomy of the auditory components of ASMR content and their ability to generate pleasurable sensations.\n","Abstract Body: With increasing academic interest in the social activities of online communities, more attention and theory building has been devoted to interpersonal interactions than to the dynamics between individuals and groups. This study seeks to understand the dissolution of individuals’ affiliation ties to groups in a large online gaming community using large-scale longitudinal data. This study extends ecology and categorization theories by exploring how meanings and boundaries of social categories are collectively constructed at multiple levels. Event history models were built to understand the dynamics of 18,585 committed players and their affiliated 5,950 groups over thirty-four months. The results show that ecological factors like niche width, category contrast, structural embeddedness and age dependence all affect the tie decay hazard. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.<br />Keywords: <i>tie decay, categorization, ecology, embeddedness, MMOG, big data<\/i><br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examined how separate and interactive effects of cognitive and emotional processing measured as attention and emotional arousal respectively contribute to willingness to like, comment or share social media health posts. The study used the eye-tracking measure of fixation duration to examine attention along with the self-reported measure of emotional arousal. The findings of the study advance knowledge about the role of cognitive and emotional processes in influencing engagement behaviors.\n","Abstract Body: Political information varies in language complexity, and such complexity influences voting behaviors. But does language complexity influence all people in the same way? This paper examines how cognitive reflection, or the tendency to override intuitive assessments to carefully engage with information, may moderate the established relationship between political language complexity and abstention on U.S. state ballot measures. We find support that language complexity differentially associates with abstention depending on one’s level of cognitive reflection. Implications for policy outcomes and future research are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The present study examines the impact of sequential coactivation, as a result of the sequential presence of pleasant and unpleasant content, on the emotional and cognitive processing of messages. Previous research has identified an inhibition effect of initial appetitive activation on the processing of subsequent aversive content. However, little is known about whether the aversive system inhibits the processing of pleasant content and the extent to which dynamic changes in arousing content modify the strength of potential inhibitory effects on subsequent message processing. Results of this study provided evidence in support of motivational inhibition during sequential coactive trajectories. Specifically, appetitive inhibition occurred when appetitive activation was greater than that of the aversive system, while aversive inhibition occurred when both systems were moderately activated. Further, this inhibiting effect limited resource allocation and further impaired participants’ memory of the subsequent content. Theoretical implications and message design recommendations are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: While much is known about the fact that people tend to form automation bias towards algorithmic decisions that are comparable to rational or neutral human decisions, relatively less is known about whether this bias will be consistently formed towards biased algorithmic decisions. Therefore, this research asks the following research question: Will humans still favor algorithmic decisions over human decisions even when unfairness is manifested by both agents? Through a laboratory experiment, the current study aims to answer this question by exploring human responses to unfair (i.e., biased) decisions made by artificial intelligence (AI) and human agents. Specifically, drawing from the related works on human-AI interaction, this study investigates whether humans will perceive unfair decisions made by AI as more a) fair, b) credible, and c) enjoyable as compared to equal unfair decisions made human agents in the social ultimatum split game (SUSG). The SUSG is developed to understand human’s altruistic nature in the context of negotiation, and this has been frequently employed by previous AI researchers to examine human responses to algorithmic decisions. In addition, given that informing the intentionality of agents can moderate the process by which people evaluate decisions made by AI as more fair and credible, we examine whether informing the intentionality of agents will have impact on the evaluation of unfair decisions made by the agents. Finally, guided by past empirical evidence, this research attempts to test the mediation path in which perceived enjoyment is posited to mediate the relationship between perceived fairness and willingness to rely on the agent (i.e., willingness to play the game with the agent again; WP).\n","Abstract Body: In this study, we focus on empathy with media characters with a physical disability and its effects on desired social distance and prosocial intentions. Thereby, we not only look at assessments of identification by participants after exposure, but also examine concurrent empathic processing by measuring participants’ psychophysiological processing during viewing. The results of a one-factorial between-subject lab experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 76 students; 69.7 percent female; age: <i>M<\/i> = 23.8 years, <i>SD<\/i> = 3.4) show that mediated portrayals, especially narratives, have the potential to reduce stigmatization and increase prosocial behavior intentions by facilitating identification with stigmatized characters. The study contributes to research on media content’s potential for the destigmatization of individuals with physical disabilities, especially concerning the role of empathic processing during viewing.\n","Abstract Body: What compels us to share information with other people? The mechanisms that explain efficient information flow from individual to individual and through social networks are key to predicting and influencing outcomes ranging from voting behavior to well-being. Recent applications of neuroimaging to the study of sharing decisions have highlighted three basic motivational processes that are associated with sharing across diverse contexts. Specifically, based on this work, sharing is thought to be driven by concerns about its effects on the sharer’s self-image and on the sharer’s social relationships. Evaluations of self-related and social concerns are thought to contribute to an overall value-based evaluation of whether sharing has more positive or negative outcomes. Theoretically, building on these insights could allow content creators to systematically influence whether and how content is shared socially across diverse contexts. Yet, this assumption has not been confirmed empirically. We developed a simple intervention designed to stimulate information sharers to engage in the self-related and social thought processes that are hypothesized to contribute to the perceived value of sharing. In this pre-registered experiment, we test whether this intervention (1) causally drives neural activity in relevant regions of interest observed during sharing decisions; (2) whether it causes changes in sharing likelihood; and (3) whether is causes changes in the responses of those who receive shared content from others.\n",null,null,"Abstracts: Seven million American students receive special education services. Studies of these students’ edtech use often focus on discourses of power and empowerment surrounding the use of individual products (e.g., Alper, 2017). In that tradition, we adopted an analytical lens of power to examine special education use of the Lexia® Core5® Reading edtech program (Core5). We interviewed special education teachers and school administrators, and observed special education classes across three elementary schools in a large suburban school district in the Midwestern US. Our analysis centered in part on when and how Core5 empowers students and teachers (e.g., providing differentiated instruction). We also concluded that scholars would be remiss to continue focusing on individual products without considering broader contexts. Special education students are frequently pulled in multiple directions for interventions across subject areas, detracting from any one tool’s potential to truly empower and necessitating consideration of larger learning ecosystems.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: This paper explores the use of peer facilitated teaching in a prison arts program. Through an interdisciplinary effort involving faculty from art, communication studies, and sociology, we designed and implemented an art instruction program that includes peer teachers in order to create a sustainable program that enables inmates to participate in art courses. The use of peer teaching engages core concepts of culturally relevant pedagogy which enhances to transformational nature of art instruction for prison inmates. The implications for instructional communication research as related to training peer teachers are outlined.\n",null,null,null,"Abstract Body: Mass shootings have become a global crisis.  Consequently, debates are ongoing about how to mitigate them.  Suggestions range from placing more stringent restrictions on guns to providing more mental health counseling.  What is less well-known is what risk factors may signal potential perpetrators.  This study begins to fill that void by focusing on active school shooters and the potential risk factors to watch for to possibly avoid manifestation of the risk into a crisis event.  More specifically, we sought to teacher perceptions of instructional self-efficacy in the classroom generally and in identifying and addressing problematic behaviors of potential shooters specifically.  Results yielded several conclusions.  With regard to teacher self-efficacy, teachers perceive themselves as able to instruct, discipline, create a positive climate, and influence decision-making in the classroom.  However, they do not perceive themselves as able to identify risk behaviors and attributes of potential shooters nor to take appropriate actions when they do.  Theoretically, the IDEA model demonstrated its utility to discover these gaps in teacher training.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The relationship between the individual and social factors that might be predictive of a child’s self-perception specific to body image is quite complex. A large body of literature has suggested that individual factors such as gender, ethnicity, age, and BMI could certainly be related to lower or high self-perception and social factors such as media exposure, especially exposure to appearance-oriented media[A1] [A2] [A3] could also be related to a child’s negative sense of self. Using a survey of children in 2<sup>nd<\/sup> and 3<sup>rd<\/sup> grade from low SES households, factors such as nutritional knowledge, food preferences, health literacy, and household dieting are considered in the context of two dependent variables designed to measure a child’s self-perception specific to body image. Of key interest is information related to body positivity and its relationship to each child’s self-perception. Results from the present study indicate that health literacy attributes and the household environment specific to dieting were the strongest predictors of negative self-perception. Results also indicated that the body positivity messaging resulted in short-term increases in overall self-perception for some participants. Results from the present study will be used to modify an existing health literacy/health intervention program. These and other findings are discussed.<br />\n","Abstracts: The first five years are a critical time for reading, creating a foundation for early language development (Duursma et al., 2008). Research suggests that like print materials, mobile screen devices can enrich preschoolers’ emergent literacy development, but it is dependent on teacher scaffolding (Neumann & Neumann, 2014). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether book format influenced preschool teachers’ scaffolding and other behaviors during reading. In a fully crossed 2x2 within-subject design, teachers (N=21) read four books (print-interactive, print-noninteractive, electronic-interactive, electronic-noninteractive) to their preschool-aged students. Preliminary analyses suggest that teachers used more dialogic reading phrases and story-related talk with print books, regardless of interactivity. Device-related talk was most common while reading interactive eBooks compared to all other books. Restrictive comments did not vary by book type. Overall, teachers used more effective scaffolding techniques with print books compared to eBooks, despite high similarity in book content.\n","Abstracts: Early childhood educators are faced with the pedagogic task of encouraging child-centred learning that incorporates digital technology into the everyday activities of the preschool classroom. This study uses video-recorded observations of children and educators using digital technology in 15 early childhood classrooms from preschool into formal schooling. As well as presenting an overview of digital technology use in classrooms, this presentation presents a case study of one preschool classroom over an entire school year to show how a child-initiated interest in a hairy caterpillar became a year-long learning experience where the children and teachers seamlessly integrated digital resources for web searching for information, communicating with museum experts and conservationists, and digital literacy experiences, resulting in a garden built to encourage this rare caterpillar. Evident was how the teacher built on the children’s interests in ways that supported children’s curiosity and problem-solving, and integrated traditional and digital tools of communication.\n","Abstracts: Digital technologies have entered nearly all early childhood classrooms, yet how teachers are incorporating the technology into their pedagogy has yet to be documented.The purpose of this study was to observe teachers using technology in early childhood classrooms to document the ways in which use is being implemented in a supportive educational approach. A total of 10, 1st grade classrooms in the Chicagoland area were observed and teachers were interviewed. Preliminary analyses indicate that teacher attitudes and practices vary dramatically by district and individual classroom, but that many teachers are incorporating technology intentionally into their traditional teaching styles rather than adapting their teaching approach to utilize the technology. In many classrooms, we saw teachers pedagogy and classroom arrangements existing in identical forms when the teacher was using the technology as not, suggesting that teachers are using technology as one of their many tools as teachers to support student learning.\n","Abstracts: School districts in the U.S. are quickly adopting one-to-one technology, often without much notice or training for teachers or parents. However, parents’ and teachers’ attitudes towards technology are highly predictive of child outcomes (Blackwell et. al., 2013; Lauricella et. al., 2015). The purpose of this study was to gain a rich understanding of parents’ and teachers’ attitudes towards their school district’s adoption of a one-to-one tablet program for kindergartners. We conducted 6 focus groups, 3 with parents of kindergartners (n=10) and 3 with kindergarten teachers (n=14), to understand how the tablets were being used at school and at home and how parents and teachers felt about this new tool. Preliminary analyses using a grounded theory approach reveal that overall, parents and teachers perceive the tablets as useful learning tools, yet overwhelmingly are concerned with a lack of communication and training for how to best support their use.\n","Abstract Body: As students prepare to give a speech in front of an audience, they often consider what they will say and do in that moment and to what extent they have speech apprehension or nervousness. However, students need to recognize the importance of audience analysis during their speech. Audience analysis is defined as the “highly systematic process of getting to know your listeners relative to the topic and the speech occasion” (O’Hair, Wiemann, Mullin, & Teven, 2018, p. 322). However, within persuasion, audience analysis can be conceptualized two ways. “First, persuaders learn about audiences in order to communicate effectively to them. In other situations, persuaders use audience analysis to create their audiences” (Borchers, 2013, p. 135). This activity provides students with the opportunity to observe how a speaker uses both of these functions of audience analysis because of the different contexts and audiences.\n","Abstract Body: This activity can be completed in one class period and helps familiarize students with ethos, pathos, and logos by giving them practice in formulating and analyzing arguments.\n","Abstract Body: This GIFT may be used effectively in courses such as Public Speaking, Organizational Communication, or Media. The activity (1) exposes students to alternative approaches in developing and organizing presentations, (2) helps students examine the pros and cons of various speech development approaches and ultimately increase self-awareness of the ideal approach for them, and (3) gives students the opportunity to reflect critically upon the impact of presentation technology.\n","Abstract Body: Intended Course: Although developed for the basic communication course, it could be used in Intercultural Communication.<br /><br />Objectives:<br />Reflect on where stereotypes are learned<br />Understand the relationship between stereotypes and unconscious biases<br />Acknowledge the impact of biases and stereotypes on individuals’ daily lives through overt or covert communication<br /><br />Description: The instructor prefaces that we have all heard of stereotypes, that some of us can relate to some stereotypes, while others are far from what we hold true. The class will be told that the following activity might be perceived as awkward, but stereotypes are not supposed to be considered comfortable. In pre-phasing the activity, the instructor will address the definition of stereotyping as well as perceptual sets. Both terms were addressed in the reading assigned for that class period (Floyd, 2018).<br />Each student in the classroom is given a notecard. They are asked to anonymously write one stereotype they have heard about each of the following groups on one notecard: black people, white people, Asian people, Lationo/Latina people, men, and women. Once the class is done writing, they will fold the notes, and put it in a bag. They each pull out a set of stereotypes another person wrote down and choose one stereotype to write on the white-board in the appropriate category. Once each student had a chance to write something down, the instructor remains quiet for a couple of minutes to let these stereotypes sink in. From there, a discussion ensues about the stereotypes with the following questions as prompts:<br />How did you learn about these stereotypes?<br />Do you identify with any in the category you consider yourself in?<br />How are some stereotypes originated?<br />How could these stereotypes be harmful?<br />How could these stereotypes play into our perceptual sets?<br />Once the students had a chance to reflect on the stereotypes, the instructor will play a 3 minute clip of the film “Zwart als Roet” by Sunny Bergman (2014). The clip reveals the difference in response of witnesses when three men, a white man, a black man, and a man from Middle East- background steal a female bike in a busy park. The video shows that people were much more likely to help the white man steal a bike, and report or film the black or Middle Eastern man due to the fear of being attacked.<br />The last part of the activity is reflection in which students give some perspective, ask questions, or share ideas they have regarding stereotypes or the impact on them. Potential question prompts include: “Where did you learn some of these stereotypes?”; “Did you realize you might be unconsciously influenced by these stereotypes?”; “Do you realize ways in which these stereotypes have influenced ideas about people?”<br /><br />Evaluation: The effectiveness of the lesson is measured through the way students react to the lesson. Many students experience discomfort, which is good. Stereotypes are uncomfortable. In the discussion, a degree of reflectiveness to will show reconsideration of the stereotypes students have heard. Students should be able to understand that stereotypes help shape our biases, which might in turn impact our communication with individuals belonging to certain racial or gender groups.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />References<br />Bergkamp, S.

As any environment, a school environment is strongly influenced by elementary evolutionary processes such as cooperation, competition, or the fear of exclusion from a group or its resources. At worst, moments of increased violence (e.g., Zimbardo’s experiments) can occur. Therefore, there needs to be a conscious focus on safety and well-being topics (e.g., as a part of primary prevention programs).<br /><br /><i>Learning goals: <\/i>An essential condition for communicating safety is, however, the ability to name behaviors, emotions, and perceptions correctly, and in practice, pupils and professionals often simply lack the vocabulary. Then comes the tendency (both among pupils and adults) to use meaningless, sometimes pejoratively connotated expressions/judgments when not knowing how to describe behavior in an accurate manner. Those statements can sound like \"\"you're behaving badly,\"\" \"\"control yourself,\"\" \"\"don't look at me that weirdly,\"\" \"\"he/she is mean to me.\"\" It is nearly impossible to comply and make a change when the mistake is not understood. Many people lack the set of skills to respond directly and politely (e.g., the crucial question: \"\"What do you mean by that?)\"\". Often, when some children have self-regulating issues, they are negatively labeled by peers and teachers. In practice, we realized that the easiest and correct intervention is simply to look for lacking social skills, physiological reasoning, and the use of accurate words in the description of behavior. If issues are named correctly, and intentionality is taken away, attitudes of teachers and peers often change. They start acting supportively, even speeding up the process of learning, changing, or healing.<br />It gets even more complicated with avoidance, withdrawing, and absenting behavioral cues such as not reacting, refusing help, not answering, not joining in group activities, that can lead to hurting a specific partner in interaction or can threaten own position in a group. These passive behaviors are often excluded, not just only from scientific journals and research coding lists, but also in the awareness of practitioners.<br />We answered these issues in two manners. First, by testing the school climate and psychosocial safety by using more behavior descriptive questions. Second, by letting the children create behavioral and emotions manuals themselves according to the specific needs.<br /><br /><i>Description of the Puzzles technique: <\/i>Communication in social interactions is a complex process and cannot be fully simplified. There is rarely just one way of solving a situation, and therefore, a puzzle proved to be a helpful and universal metaphor. It also helps to keep in mind the complexity of variables and suggest relationships between them. The puzzle can be used with the entire class (during prevention and social skills development lessons) or with one child during an individual consultation. We use puzzle pictures to figure out the specific recipe, a system of how to act in this particular situation (in line with CBT protocols). In our case, we use this technique to help children and adolescents respond to conflicts and cope with discomfort.<br />Through the activity of replacing one single dysfunctional puzzle with a new one making the entire scheme work better, also new thinking patterns are transferred. Furthermore, it allows the freedom of experimenting and creating themselves. The idea of just needing a better working puzzle instead of blaming themselves (for being too hyperactive, shy, overweighed, etc.) takes away many obstacles in learning.<br />The puzzles technique can vary in its form. From a black and white small, quickly drawn down scheme to a prepared cardboard blank puzzles, or elaborated pictures made in Arts classes. The number of puzzles and specific shapes are dependent on the need for educative and social interventions. Simple symbols or shapes such as a circle, a house, or a human body proved to be useful. Balancing between time requirements (45 mins school hours) and creating functioning schemes, students provide on average 5-12 puzzles.<br /><br /><i>Examples of use: <\/i>In full classes, students compose and draw manuals. They list specific behavioral displays of, e.g., friendly behaviors, or behaviors leading to getting positive attention, and the final puzzle (in this case usually in the shape of the human body) stays in their classroom as a changeable/transformative support tool. At the individual and intra-personal level, but still, within the entire class group, we focus on self-regulation skills, within-person long-term goals, or adapting learning habits. For example, when pupils are experiencing troubles with self-regulation (e.g., sitting on a chair for a long time), they suggest some activities that could help them to cope and draw a puzzle scheme. Activities can be walking during breaks, avoiding sugary drinks, using a stress-relieving ball, drawing, standing up, writing down a joke to prevent feelings of tension, and also as a handout for intervention needs. This technique is also usable when the attention is not focused internally but towards an interactional partner. For example, when children have safety concerns of being called names by a peer, they usually compose puzzle recipes from preventive acts, e.g. staying close to specific classmates, practicing assertive methods, asking for a supportive hug, making agreements with specific classmates to be more receptive to those behaviors, having a descriptive scheme of how to approach responsible adult for help etc. This technique is also helpful for team building aims. With the same logic, each member gets one puzzle as a piece of the group, and depending on the topic, they can think of what picture they form as a class. Positive outcomes include communicating expectations and needs, own roles and positions in the group, delivering feedback, and describing the group.<br /><br /><i>Evaluation:<\/i> Summarized, this approach allows for changing thinking patterns both on an individual and on a group level in schools and, moreover, to create a real individual approach towards every student’s specific needs and individual differences.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The theory of dialectical tensions has primarily been used to study interpersonal relationships and groups. This study examines the dialectical tensions experienced by graduate teaching assistants. Through one-on-one interviews and analysis of syllabi, three dialectal tensions developed: the desire to be perceived as personable and the desire to be perceived as professional, the desire for an instructor lead classroom and a student lead classroom, and the management of work time and personal time. These tensions, along with the methods which graduate teaching assistants used to manage them, offer better insight into the dynamics of the position of a graduate teaching assistant. <br />\n","Abstract Body: The study of memorable messages (Knapp, Stohl, & Reardon, 1981) places communication at the center of social research in identity, cognition, and behavior across multiple contexts. As institutions of higher education aim to support diverse campus communities, a sense of urgency has developed to better understand the predictors of success for faculty and students of color. Memorable messages offer a framework to study faculty and students of color success because it centers communication in research regarding self-perception and behavior. Amongst the growing body of literature about the needs and challenges of faculty and students of color in higher education, one finding is unequivocal: messages matter and matter far beyond the initial utterance. In addition to discussing the difficulties that both faculty and students of color experience, this paper explores how memorable messages research from a variety of conceptual and theoretical standpoints can be used to better understand the role of communication in shaping student and faculty success.\n","Abstract Body: This study set out to validate the Instructor Communication Memorable Messages (ICMM) Scale and test its predictive power in relation to student outcomes (motives to communicate, motivation, learner empowerment, and relational distance). Results confirmed the two-factor instrument structure for confirming and disconfirming messages as well as validated traditional measures for motivation and relational distance; adaptations had to be made to the motives to communicate (removing items from the excuses subscale) and learner empowerment (removing impact subscale). Results revealed weak to moderate predictive power for confirming and disconfirming messages with respect to student outcomes. Additional validity and student outcome testing is needed to ferret out the nuanced ways in which these constructs work together.<br />\n","Abstract Body: During Fall 2018 faculty from the School of Communication Studies (SCS), Kent State University, Ohio, USA, and the Institute of Press and Information Sciences (ISPI) in Tunisia collaborated to create a transnational classroom experiment for students enrolled in the Intercultural Communication course. This paper reports on the process, the results, and the lessons learned from this transnational educational experience. Although ICT tools provided a cost-free space for transnational intellectual collaboration, the process was not free of challenges and obstacles. The time zone, along with political, and administrative contexts affected the process and the outcome of the experience and compelled educators to adapt and adjust their goals, objectives, and expectations to the environmental and contextual influences.\n","Abstract Body: Education technology is a booming industry based on optimism for Edtech’s potential to transform education and learning outcomes. This investment indicates real promise for Edtech’s diffusion, yet less is known about the public’s view of technology’s role in education. To help fill our knowledge base, we conducted a mixed-methods analysis based on a survey of a representative sample of the U.S. population (N=2,254) that explores perceptions of artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual reality (VR) in education. Respondents were more accepting of VR as a teaching tool than they were of AI taking on various roles in education. AI as an assistive tool was more accepted than AI with more decision-making responsibilities. Personality had an influence on, and experiential traits were most important for, respondents’ openness to the education technologies. The results suggest support for a blended model of AI and VR use in the classroom.\n","Abstract Body: When teaching public speaking, instructors often can, should, and do show exemplars of public speaking. While political speeches are a common tool in the classroom, students often desire more content-specific exemplars that represent informative and persuasive speeches (Jones-Bodie, Anderson, & Hall, forthcoming). In the past few years, competitive speech and debate, or forensics, has begun releasing the videos of nationally competitive speakers who perform informative and persuasive presentations, among others. With this resource available, however, instructors must question the effect that showing a forensics exemplar to public speaking students will have on those students. This project examines the effects of modeling public speaking behavior using priming and social cognitive theory (SCT; Bandura & National Institutes of Mental Health, 1986). Given that forensics students often dress in business professional clothing, perform with memorized delivery, and exude a skill level much higher than what is to be expected from one semester in a public speaking course, this online experiment used SCT to test the impact of more similar and less similar exemplars in shaping student learning outcomes. A 2 (priming: yes, no) x 2 (formal: (formal, informal) online experiment was conducted among a sample of undergraduate students (<i>N <\/i>= 100). Preliminary results indicated that informal exemplars led to greater public speaking self-efficacy than formal exemplars. No interaction effects were noted. Implications for teaching and learning are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This paper outlines the collaborative creation of an online learning module designed to develop students’ information literacy capability: identifying information types, searching online databases, and evaluating quality using an indigenous-informed evaluation framework. Student learning was measured using reflective assessments. The paper challenges communication teachers and librarians to collaborate to explicitly embed information literacy development into large core courses as a means to support students’ transition into tertiary learning and enhance their lifelong learning capability.\n","Abstract Body: The purpose of the present study was to examine instructional communicative influences of students' task value. A total of 382 undergraduate students participated in this survey study. The data supported a mediated model in which instructor misbehaviors (i.e., antagonism and lecturing) indirectly decrease students’ task value through the psychological responses of perceived immediacy and burnout. Therefore, findings of this study indicate that instructors who do not control their antagonism and lecturing behaviors may reduce the value that students see in the course they teach, ultimately hindering students’ learning experience.\n","Abstract Body: As technology access and use increases in formal learning environments including classrooms, there is an increased need to teach and support student’s understanding of core digital citizenship competencies. While teaching of digital literacy in education has some historical context, it is only relatively recently that we have seen school districts expand their awareness and teaching of more complete digital competencies to include internet safety, media balance, and digital footprint concepts. The purpose of this paper is to better document and understand how and in what types of schools early childhood teachers are beginning to introduce digital citizenship competencies in early childhood years, specifically kindergarten through 5th grade. Results from this descriptive study, indicate that early childhood educators are beginning to teach these core digital citizen competencies as early as kindergarten but not all aspects of digital citizenship are being taught equally. These results have implications for early childhood education and policies around supporting digital citizenship lessons starting early in formal schooling.\n","Abstract Body: One particularly exciting platform with the potential to teach STEM in early childhood classrooms is the tablet. However, one challenge in using these devices for STEM learning is that traditional tablets lack important sensory information. The emerging technology of haptic (or tactile) feedback touch-screen displays might reduce this barrier. In order to better understand pre-school teachers’ attitudes toward haptic technology in teaching STEM concepts, we conducted focus groups. Themes identified from the focus groups provide insight on teachers’ attitudes and could influence the design of future STEM apps created for haptic tablets. Ideally, if these technologies can be realized to improve STEM learning and engagement, the young children using these devices now may become our next scientists, mathematicians, engineers, and technology experts in the future!<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study identified the patterns of motivation (i.e., the motivation profiles) that reflect the interrelationships among expectancies of success, utility value beliefs, and perceptions of cost pertaining to an important school domain, namely mathematics. In addition, this research investigated similarities/differences among these profiles with regard to a set of eight motivation and communication factors that play key roles in learning environments: the motive to avoid failure, competitiveness, entity theory of intelligence, prevention orientation, general and school-related communicative self-efficacy, satisfaction in communicating with the mathematics teacher, and communication apprehension. To examine these aspects, data were collected from 463 secondary school students. Latent profile analyses were conducted to identify the motivation profiles. The results indicate that four motivation profiles provided a parsimonious representation of students’ patterns of expectancies of success, utility value, and cost related to mathematics. In addition, significant differences among profiles were found for the majority of the factors.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines open science practices, such as open educational resources and open textbooks, which make higher education more affordable for students, and provide faculty with better access to and control over their instructional resources. Fifty-three open textbooks published in the field of communication were analyzed using the following criteria: availability of learning objectives, easily identifiable key terms, key takeaways, practical/real-world examples, assessments/exercises or discussion questions linked to learning objectives, additional resources, as well as the quality of writing, text formatting and images/graphics. Out of nine textbooks which met all proposed criteria three were in public speaking. Several other textbooks that did not meet all criteria were still found to be excellent texts based on existing peer reviews. It was found that suitable open textbooks exist in various communication disciplines.<br />Keywords: open science, open textbooks, communication education; OER\n","Abstract Body: “Critical communication” and “communication activism” pedagogies in universities are important because they teach students to become aware of how communication processes can produce social difference and be harnessed to advocate for social justice. To keep these pedagogical aims relevant to younger generations and promote open practices of communication instruction, the pedagogies can benefit from an injection of culturally responsive approaches that engage college students today. To this end, this essay reflects on the fusion of “critical hip hop pedagogy” into my own communication teaching praxis through a course I developed, “Hip Hop Culture, Communication, and Social Change.” The course seeks to open up critical pedagogical spaces that examine social difference in society at large and culturally expressive modes of community building and activism in Chicago.<br /><br /><i>Keywords: critical hip hop pedagogy, critical communication pedagogy, communication <\/i><i>activism pedagogy, hip hop culture, Chicago<\/i>\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the relationship between student-veterans’ self-perceived level of participation in school activities/events and school organizations and the association his/her participation has with his/her level of assimilation to college life. Subjects in the study were one hundred student-veterans from a southwestern university and college. The instruments for the study were the Veteran’s Involvement Questionnaire (VIQ) a modification of Grover’s (2014) Family Involvement Questionnaire and the Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ) (Baker, 2017). The results of the study reveal significant correlation between the variables participation and assimilation. The results of the study also suggest the need for further research to investigate other factors that contribute to student veterans’ assimilation into campus culture.\n","Abstract Body: This GIFTS activity involves using a smartphone app recently created by talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, called Heads Up as an innovative way to teach the dynamics of nonverbal and verbal communication. This activity has the direct educational benefits of helping students understand concepts like encoding, decoding, meaning, and perception. As an added bonus, the activity is also a way for an instructor to demonstrate immediacy by incorporating popular culture and technology in the classroom.\n","Abstract Body: Being able to define and conceptualize persuasion and its nuances without engaging in coercion, propaganda, and/or manipulation can be difficult for students at first. This activity centralizes the fine points among these persuasive concepts. This activity further explores to what extent persuasion is effective through the compelling nature of storytelling. “A story can have a dramatic effect and can be a great source of persuasion” (Beeson, 2014, p. 109). Rather than only having a conversation about the common characteristics of persuasion, coercion, propaganda, and manipulation and how these ideas differ, students can observe them within the fictional movie <i>The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1.<\/i> The plot of <i>The Hunger Games <\/i>franchise focuses on how revolution occurs and persuasion plays a key role in that rebellion. By observing and critically evaluating these persuasion examples, students can further improve their own persuasive techniques. If instructors choose to engage in the debriefing activity, students can also comprehend how ethics impact these course concepts as well.\n","Abstract Body: When giving a persuasive speech, speakers often focus on other aspects, such as the motivation for the speech, speech delivery techniques, and credibility. However, the underlying knowledge and the reasoning used to support the argument often become afterthoughts. This activity utilizes the classic board game <i>Clue <\/i>to focus students’ attention on how to formulate soundly reasoned persuasive arguments. Rather than only playing a game, this activity allows students to assess persuasive arguments and critically analyze how to use sound reasoning in their speeches. It employs the basic rules and premise of the classic board game to encourage students to consider how persuasive arguments are constructed; it also demonstrates what happens to a persuasive argument when that statement isn’t well supported with facts and conclusions.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Title of Activity:<\/i> Dialogical Reflexivity Through ‘Pretend Play’<br /><br /><i>Intended Course:<\/i> Dialogic Communication<br /><br /><i>Learning Goals/Objectives:<\/i><br /><br />At the end of the session, the participants should be able to:<br />1. perform individual and collaborative problem-based tasks in a playful learning environment;<br />2. demonstrate dialogic communication in their play performances; and<br />3. analyze reflections on their experiences using Margaret Archer’s Theories of Reflexivity.<br /><br /><i>Description of Activity:<\/i><br /><br />A study on reflective dialogue in the context of classrooms revealed that it is creativity, more than explicit reasoning, that plays a greater role in generating productive dialogues (Wegerif, 2007). It was further observed that the level and extent of creativity found in classroom dialogues is promoted through educational design. Thus, I propose a design that reframes the conventional relationships in the classroom. From a teacher-facilitator to teacher-co-player, from students to players, and from classroom to imagined spaces, this design invites participants to experience ‘theater as play’ in an immersive learning environment.<br /><br />In the ‘theater as play’ philosophy, the dialogues are not written by a playwright, but rather, shall emerge from the play interactions of the participants who perform ‘roles,’ fulfill quests, and engage in collaborative problem-solving. Participants will form groups, and each group will be given game cards where problem-based tasks and carefully detailed game rules can be found. The “What-If” of the ‘improv’ play, akin to a live role-playing game, is that participants are secretly joining a revolutionary movement. They need to undergo initiation in stealth mode amid a festival event, while avoiding the risk of being caught by the civil guards. While the festival is on going, the participants need to collaborate, communicate, be resourceful and creative in order to evade the guards and successfully do the tasks.<br /><br />Note that this immersive play does not require massive props, sets or costumes. The power of “What-if” taps the imagination of the players, and they enter the make-believe world with the help of the story premise, the music, and the game cards. Only printed game cards, activated by artful, convincing facilitation and storytelling are needed to enact the play. Any given space can be transformed into a festive venue using available materials and music. Participants will no longer just be participants, but will assume the roles of revolutionary group aspirants and civil guards. This kind of theater takes inspiration from children’s ‘pretend play’ or make-believe play, also called ‘playing house.’ Creativity, imagination, collaboration, spontaneity, risk-taking, and resourcefulness are activated.<br /><br />Theater, with the cognitive and visceral experiences that it gives, may prompt dialogue and reflection, especially since this theater is not the conventional type where actors and audiences (in the classroom, teacher and students) are separated by a fourth wall. Allowing playful experiences to emerge will generate spontaneous communicative interactions in a safely curated environment.<br /><br />According to Bakhtin, dialogue “is a multi-layered process that constantly unfolds throughout time and possesses virtually no generic characteristics” (Kim, 2011, p. 55). Being multi-layered, it respects multiple voices and different worldviews. For Bakhtin, communication participants bring with them a world view with its own meanings and values. If the interactions between or among the different worldviews are mutual and reciprocal, these will eventually influence or condition one another. New meanings will then emerge. However, this is predicated on the communication participants’ openness and willingness to suspend judgment and willingness to accommodate worldviews different from their own. This respect for multiple meanings therefore arises through dialogues between differing world views and voices (Kim, 2011).<br /><br /><i>Evaluation of Activity:<\/i><br /><br />Participants are asked to reflect on their experiences through writing and these reflections will be analyzed from the frame of Margaret Archer’s Theories of Reflexivity.<br /><br />Dialogues spring from deep reflection. According to Ryan (2014), reflection “is an intensely personal undertaking, yet a conscious awareness can prompt deep learning about our relationship with the world and the people around us” (p.7). Being both an individual and a social process, reflection may lead people to interrogate how their own personal understandings are mediated by dominant worldviews. In this regard, Ryan argues that what can be used as lens to understand such dynamics is that of Margaret Archer’s theories of reflexivity.<br /><br />Archer (2007) defines reflexivity as “the regular exercise of the mental ability, shared by all normal people, to consider themselves in relation to their (social) contexts and vice versa” (p. 4). Archer further presents these modes of reflexivity: “1) Communicative reflexives: Those whose internal conversations require completion and confirmation by others before resulting in courses of action; 2) Autonomous reflexives: Those who sustain self-contained internal conversations, leading directly to action; 3) Meta-reflexives: Those who are critically reflexive about their own internal conversations and critical about effective action in society; 4) Fractured reflexives: Those whose internal conversations intensify their distress and disorientation rather than leading to purposeful courses of action” (p. 93). Understanding our reflexive processes is crucial in developing self-awareness.<br /><br />Participants will individually write a short reflection note about his/her experiences in the immersive play. Then, in pairs, they will analyze the modes of reflexivity present in their reflections. Knowing our inner speech and how other people occupy voices in our internal dialogue allows us to experience communication as a discursive reflection.<br /><br />Also, the learning design is an innovative approach that can be applied in the classroom, in organizations, and in development communication. The proposed design has been proven to activate flow based on the Flow Theory by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is a mental state of complete absorption in the current experience. The right combination of challenge and fun in the learning design, along with the power of play to make us unconsciously disclose our worldviews similar to how we engaged in ‘pretend play’ when we were children, is what makes this proposed GIFTS activity worth pursuing.<br /><br /><i>References:<\/i><br /><br />Archer, M.S.

Epistemologists have developed several typologies of the ways of knowing. We ground this activity in Peirce's four ways of knowing: knowing by tenacity/tradition, by authority, on a priori grounds, or through the method of science.\n","Abstract Body: Throughout history, families have relied on stories to pass down memories, family traditions, and culture (Segrin & Flora, 2019). Family stories represent “verbal accounts of personal experiences that are important to the family, and typically involve the creation and maintenance of relationships, depict rules of interaction, and reflect beliefs about family and other social institutions” (Fiese et al., 2001, p. 260). Family stories can vary in topics from birth stories, relationship formation stories, and stories about the family overcoming a hardship. Stories also fulfill a variety of functions including a socialization function that is meant to “socialize children into roles and behavior that parents hope children will enact later in life” (Segrin & Flora, 2019, p. 56).<br /><br />Similarly, social learning theory (Bandura, 1977) uses the process of observational learning to suggest that (in the context of families) children can learn behaviors they should adopt and/or avoid by modeling other family members behavior. Social learning theory implies that observations occur repeatedly and visually. In other words, for observational learning to happen, people must see the behavior to be modeled. However, since stories also serve to teach preferred behaviors (e.g., socialization function; Segrin & Flora, 2019), family stories also provide opportunities for observational learning by hearing about, instead of seeing, behaviors. The purpose of this activity is for students to apply the relevant concepts of social learning theory to one of their own family stories. In addition, this activity teaches students to critically evaluate foundational aspects of social learning theory.\n","Abstract Body: Many students experience communication apprehension and are afraid to talk in class, ask questions, or approach the professor. This activity helps build positive peer relationships early in the class to help students feel comfortable participating in class discussions and to ask questions. Students take the Personal Report of Communication Apprehension (McCroskey) within the first week of classes. Based on their results, assign them to groups of 5-7 peers. Instruct them to spend 2 hours outside of class doing something fun and communicative. Afterwards, have them fill out a brief questionnaire or write a brief reflection essay on their experience with their peers.\n","Abstract Body: An increase in demand for online education has led to the creation of a new technology, machine teachers, or artificial intelligence (AI) teaching assistants. In fact, AI teaching assistants have already been implemented in a small number of courses in the United States. However, little is known about how students will perceive AI teaching assistants in their own classrooms. Thus, the present study investigated students’ perceptions about AI teaching assistants in higher education by use of an online survey. Primary findings indicate that perceived usefulness of an AI teaching assistant and perceived ease of communication with an AI teaching assistant are key to understanding an eventual adoption of AI teaching assistant-based education. These findings provide support for AI teaching assistant adoption. Based on the present study’s findings, more research is needed to better understand the nuances associated with the learning experience one may have from an AI teaching assistant.\n","Abstract Body: This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Lexia<sup>®<\/sup> PowerUp Literacy<sup>®<\/sup> blended learning program (PowerUp), which was designed to promote literacy skills among struggling and non-proficient adolescent readers through a series of online activities and teacher-led lessons. Using a cluster randomized trial, we tested PowerUp’s impact on a sample of 155 struggling and non-proficient readers enrolled in supplemental literacy classes in two middle schools. Students in classes that used PowerUp scored significantly higher on STAR Reading (STAR), a standardized reading assessment, than students in control classes. Effects were comparable for both White and Black students. The faster students completed key PowerUp online content, the higher their STAR scores. Together, these findings provide strong evidence in favor of PowerUp’s effectiveness. Further implications for theory and practice are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: <br />To assess the influence of quantity and quality of contact on attitudes towards intercultural communication, 21 domestic-international undergraduate student pairs engaged in semi-structured interaction tasks over the course of a semester. Following each interaction, the 42 participants wrote reflections. Using content analysis, these reflections were coded for major themes. Predominant themes common to both domestic and international students include: Thought-provoking, Learning, and Connection. Other themes highly relevant to domestic students were Increased Understanding of Self and Pleasurable/Enjoyment. Other themes highly relevant to international students were Challenging and Open. The least predominant themes common to both domestic and international students include: Stereotype-Confirm, No personal Change, Own-reject, and Awkward. Examination of the most and least predominant themes indicate support for the contact hypothesis.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Drawing from the theory of planned behavior, a belief elicitation study was conducted to gain insights on the substantive considerations that guide Chinese EFL students’ decision to participate in English in class. Four semi-structured focus groups in Chinese were used to elicit salient beliefs from a total of 34 Chinese university students enrolled in a Sino-American international branch campus. Transcripts were translated to English from Chinese and content analyzed with kappa’s inter-rater agreement thresholds set at .90. Participants appear to consider forms of attentive listening an integral part of classroom participation, probably given their pre-college education experience. They also perceived participation to be an effective means to improve English skills and to acquire a “Western mindset,” but also a frustrating practice that can waste class time and generate anxiety. With their verbal and nonverbal, positive and negative interactions, both instructors and classmates play a crucial role in affecting students’ intention to participate in English in class. Practical pedagogical implications as well as relevant theoretical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This phenomenological qualitative study explores the meaning of global engagement among American students who are participants in a global scholars program. Students spent the first semester of their first (freshman) year at the University of Sydney in Australia before returning to their home campus. The resulting research will further inform program coordinators as they work with future cohorts and may guide study abroad or global education experiences at other colleges and universities.\n","Abstract Body: The purpose of this investigation was two-fold: (1) to ascertain the extent to which course type (face-to-face or distance) affects instructor credibility; and (2) to examine whether these perceptions differ as a function of student nationality. Using a 2 X 2 factorial MANOVA, findings among New Zealand born and Chinese international students studying in New Zealand revealed that face-to-face students rated teachers as significantly higher on all three aspects of credibility: caring, competence, and trustworthiness. Results also revealed Chinese students rated teachers as significantly higher on all three aspects of credibility. Implications, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Measures of social capital like trust have been declining in America for the better part of a century, with an influx of immigrant diversity appearing to quicken the decline. And yet, direct interactions with diversity can reinforce feelings of trust. Except differences now prevent the requisite contact from occurring, as new means of creating shared experiences have become necessary. The present study tested the value of gamified roleplaying for fostering trust in immigrants. Students in an online American Government class at a major southeastern university were asked to create a fictional persona from either Mexico, India, or China, and seek U.S. citizenship. Their success or failure factored into their overall grade. Results suggest that roleplaying the administrative experience of immigrants contributes to trusting them over time. This has value for life in a diverse, withdrawn society.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores the early days of business education with the aim of understanding how the Harvard Business School (HBS) contributed to the constitution of ‘management’ as a science-based profession. The research focuses on HBS signature pedagogy, the case method, and its role in the institutionalization of managerial knowledge. The research is based on a qualitative content analysis of HBS Annals published between 1908 and 1930. Through a manual coding of the annals, the paper traces the diffusion of the case method in the curriculum and connects it with the institutional transformations that took place between 1908 and 1930. The data show how HBS curriculum transitioned from lectures to case teaching in the aftermath of World War I. This pedagogy allowed HBS to demonstrate the possibility of systematically investigate management problems and to deliver business education at scale. The discussion argues that the case method, acting as a boundary object between business praxis and management theories, constituted management as a science-based profession. Recent debates have emerged about case method’s ability to critically question socio-economic structures within which business is conducted. This paper contributes to the debate arguing that the historical and institutional factors leading to the affirmation this pedagogical approach had a substantive role in the type of knowledge produced through its application. The findings challenge the idea that the affirmation of the case method is attributable to its epistemological primacy in investigating business problems.\n","Abstract Body: This study presents the results of a quasi-experimental pilot program incorporating a virtual reality (VR) public-speaking training simulation as an aid in a basic communication course. Results indicate that VR practice is associated with higher subsequent speech delivery grades in the course for participating students, but did not reduce public speaking anxiety, nor was any software-based feedback associated with increased grades. Results are discussed in terms of the feasibility of adoption and use of existing public-speaking software in large undergraduate public-speaking courses, as well as potential applications for similar interventions in advanced courses.\n","Abstract Body: This study transferred the personalization effect – using conversational style instead of formal style – to quiz design, specifically to questions and feedback. Ninety-two students were randomly assigned to a 2 (personalized vs. formal questions) x 2 (personalized vs. formal feedback) between-subjects factorial design. Personalized questions or personalized feedback generated better knowledge retrieval. Only personalized questions fostered learning (retention and transfer). Interaction effects showed that coherent styles resulted in higher transfer results and interest than incoherent styles.\n","Abstract Body: Many communication courses are discussion-oriented, where students provide personal experiences with class material. However, a challenge is that students often struggle brainstorming relevant stories to tell or examples to share. Especially for young students without employment or extracurriculars, many think they have very little history in organizations and with organizing. Not remembering all their involvements can limit class discussion and may also be detrimental in employment interviews. The first part of this activity gives students time outside of class to brainstorm their experiences and present them creatively to the class. The second part of this activity gives students the opportunity to reflect on what they have learned in class and what they want their organizational future to look like. This activity helps students learn who each other are and practice giving presentations at the front of the room, which facilitate community-building and skill development.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Abstract<br />Drawing on qualitative in-depth interviews, the study aims to understand the implications of social media use for immigrant youth’s cross-cultural adaptation in Macao. It approaches this issue by exploring how young immigrants navigate various social media platforms as tools for coping with acculturative stress, acquiring sociocultural skills and psychological self-seeking during the dual-process of relocation and emerging adults. It found that young immigrants relied highly on home-based social media platforms to obtain emotional support from their left-behind family, friends and co-ethnics typical of the initial period of immigration. To better adapt to the host society, they also learned to use host-based social media platforms as a way of acquiring cultural-specific skills and knowledge in respect of school adjustment, language-skill acquisition, local information seeking and online participation in local community events. Always switching over various platforms, young immigrants gradually developed a hybridized online space where they can realize a psychological adapting self through striking a balance of home and host social media. The study highlights that in the unique cross-border context under “one country two systems” different social media platforms may not work as opposites in immigrant youth’s adaptive process but be complementary for their psychological and sociocultural adaptation.<br />Keywords: Immigration; Social Media; Cross-cultural Adaptation; Acculturation\n",null,"Abstract Body: As the Internet and social media has been widely developed and advanced in China, Chinese public discourse’s scope and power have become noticeable (Huang, Wu, Cheng & Lyu, 2016). In this context, the public discourse has been given the talent and the ability to access information far and wide through Internet (Bowman & Willis, 2003), thus gaining the scope and power to contest authoritative voices. Given that the communication barriers and conflict between government’s and public discourse have not been eliminated, which means the transmission of government’s discourse cannot achieve the expected effect or even produce positive effects, this study attempts to use a multi-case study to discuss the representation, nature, and causes of communication failure in China’s social media field. In this study, I proposed that the failure of communication in the social media field is mainly manifested in the antagonistic interpretation and banter reproduction of public discourse to government’s discourse. Such antagonistic interpretations and banter reproductions have an overtly confrontational character usually aimed at the speaker’s realistic interest, right to know, right to define, or right to explain. The fundamental reason for this communication failure is the lack of dialogue between government’s and public discourse. Public discourse does not trust government’s discourse, whereas government’s discourse avoids the challenge and appeal of public discourse. Only by improving the dialogue between the government’s and public discourse can we fundamentally offset the failure of the communication.<br /> <br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> government’s discourse, public discourse, failure of communication, social media, antagonistic interpretation, banter reproduction<br />\n","Abstract Body: This article examines how oplakvane (“complaining, mourning”) is enacted as a ritual within Bulgarian discourse.  Ethnographically collected data is examined for the presence of oplakvane: its structure, function, and cultural norms and values.  Local symbols and cultural notions of being (the “mentality”), dwelling (the “Bulgarian situation”), and feeling (resignation and anger) are evoked by the participants within the practice. The data indicates that initiating the oplakvane ritual utilizes local cultural symbols and their meanings in order to not only create shared bond through the experience of misery, but also index political stances, and allow the participants to engage in a complex social political action.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores the online market for language learning. Specifically, we consider LanguaSpeak (pseudonym), a platform that connects teachers, learners, and language exchangers for virtual meetings online. Drawing on a survey (N = 1,086) we examine which user characteristics affect various types/patterns of use on the platform. In particular, we consider how use is affected by individuals’ instrumental and affective motivations for learning languages, and theorize underlying motivations and consequences of use. We conclude that LanguaSpeak in particular, and language learning platforms in general, do offer the potential for cultivating cultural openness, but also highlight that a variety of instrumental concerns contour individuals’ motivations for use. Further, our results indicate that instrumental and affective motivations are complexly intertwined. We conclude by calling on scholars of platforms and intercultural communication to devote renewed attention to issues of language learning and language ideology in light of their potential role in facilitating –or hindering- cross-cultural connection and understanding.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Countering conventional theory, this study found that online homophily and heterophily—connectivity with both similar and dissimilar others—are not necessarily countervailing phenomena. Respondents in five Arab countries who say the Internet has increased their contact with politically and religiously similar people also tend to say it increased their contact with politically and religiously <i>different<\/i> people (N=4,198 from Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Lebanon, Qatar, UAE). A scale of four items measuring online political and religious homophily and heterophily was reliable among all respondents (<i>a<\/i>=.754; .79 among Arab nationals), and is referred to in this paper as an “idea chamber” index. The study explored numerous media use and attitudinal correlates of the measure, and the strongest predictor was online political efficacy, which positively predicted idea chamber scores in all countries.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The purpose of this study was to examine which factors influence the social perception of a person who had attempted suicide or had suicidal ideation. We focused on the cultural context, including the impact of Korean’s cultural factors such as -<i>chemyon- <\/i>sensitivity, conformity tendency and interdependent self on the social stigma associated with suicide. We found that these indigenous cultural characteristics were closely connected to the social stigma of suicide. These findings have important implications for suicide prevention and for developing culturally appropriate interventions.<br /><br />Keywords: suicide, cultural contexts, social stigma\n","Abstract Body: <i>In 2017, newly elected President Donald J. Trump released new, controversial immigration policies. The policies targeted immigrants from specific countries and left many current and potential international visitors to the U.S. wondering about their status and whether existing or pending visas of all types would be honored. Among the potentially affected people were more than one million international college students. This exploratory study asked international students how they interpreted the federal policy and their university’s response to it, and how they perceived the policy would affect their short- and long-term decisions regarding staying at the university or in the U.S. Findings suggest the international students’ experiences could be profoundly affected by the political rhetoric of the country’s leadership. While an educational institution could distance itself from the rhetoric and currently enrolled students may be reluctant to terminate their enrollment regardless of the political climate, their educational experiences, career plans, and recommendations they pass on to potential enrollees may remain unaffected by the university’s efforts. The study highlights the necessity of studying such topics as educational experiences and political communication effects in concord, underscoring the fluidity and interconnectedness of aspects of our lives traditionally studied separately.<\/i>\n","Abstract Body: Inspired by the co-cultural thery, this study uses a phenomenological approach and 25 in-depth interviews to better understand the use of ethnic media of Chinese students in the U.S. and the impact of such media or imagined community upon their identification needs. The research findings indicate that integration and separation are the main co-cultural communication outcome and that Chinese students are using ethnic media as an assertive communication approach. From a co-cultural communication perspective, their ethnic media use reflects their dynamic negotiation of cultural identities and their efforts to redefine themselves while incorporating their own cultural background with the expectations of others. It also highlights that Chinese students use ethnic media not only for community building and cultural identity reinforcement but also assertively to express themselves and educate others.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines place-making by Syrian Armenians who have fled to Armenia to escape the violence of the Syrian civil war. Interviews carried out in Armenia found that despite cultural similarities that enabled the refugees to connect with “locals,” differences remain in the ways work and cultural place-making activities are communicated and carried out in Armenia compared to Syria. Such differences became the impetus for change for newcomers and locals alike. This happened in multiple ways including fostering new communication practices, changing gender roles and highlighting cultural traditions.\n","Abstract Body: Tongan students are among the least likely to earn a bachelor’s degree of all major ethnic groups in the United States (Teranishi et al., 2010). Given the documented effects associated with low educational attainment, it is essential that researchers focus their attention on the cultural and ethnic groups that are most academically disadvantaged. As such, this study aimed to uncover how communication hinders Tongan students’ success in higher education. In-depth interviews were conducted with 30 Tongan students who had either (a) graduated from college or (b) began college but did not complete their degrees. Findings revealed that, in regard to higher education, normative Whiteness is communicatively constructed and maintained via programmatical, structural, and interpersonal communication. The discourse of normative Whiteness, and the exclusionary communicative practices that reinforce this discourse, foster <i>a sense of un-belonging<\/i> for Tongan students in institutions of higher education, which hinders their academic success.\n","Abstract Body: I examine the discursive construction of integration through analysis of an ethnographic project that included 31 formal, semi-structured interviews in Antwerp, Belgium, which has invested in establishing and entrenching systems of integration - systems that facilitate open communication between newcomers and Belgian citizens. Considering this investment, integration failure is constructed as the singular result of the “mindsets” of (im)migrants, which is central to the three integration dictums (<i>Learn the Language<\/i>, <i>Get a Job<\/i>, and <i>Adapt Culturally<\/i>) I deconstruct in this paper. While each of these dictums read as rather straightforward, barriers such as geographical segregation, cultural reservedness, and racial discrimination complicate these supposedly innocuous instructions. While the structural investment in integration in Antwerp is impressive, the discursive conceptualization of integration as having a fixed and prescriptive threshold not only makes integration a more difficult endeavor for (im)migrants to achieve, but fuels cyclical anti-immigrant sentiments that point to a paucity of successful integration, hindering open communication in the process.\n","Abstract Body: This study aims to contribute to better clarity about the utility and understanding of the stereotype content model (SCM) in a multi-racial South-east Asian economy. Based on SCM, we examine Singapore citizens’ perceptions of three immigrant groups in Singapore (Chinese nationals, Caucasians, and foreign workers), as well as the influence of social media on stereotypes. An analysis of a survey of 424 undergraduate students suggests that the findings are not entirely consistent with the SCM expectations. In line with SCM, competition was associated with less warmth for Chinese nationals. There are no significant associations between status and competence for Caucasians, as well as between competition and warmth for Caucasians and foreign workers. On the other hand, competition predicted competence for Caucasians while status predicted warmth for foreign workers. Social media consumption and heterogeneous online discussion had some effect on stereotypes but not social media production.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Recent studies investigating misinformation spread have been situated within political contexts and have used psychological and technological approaches. In response, this study illuminates everyday life situations where people discover misinformation. Based on interviews conducted in Vietnam, it found that people’s decision to counteract misinformation in part links to their existent relationship with its sharer. People tend to counteract misinformation shared by significant others rather than by strangers. The need to adhere to norms in order to keep the relationships harmonious and to avoid embarrassing the sharer shapes what methods are used to counteract misinformation. The findings demonstrate the role of maintaining relationships in choosing appropriate ways of counteracting misinformation, offering insights for reconciling ideological polarizations in everyday life.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Refugees and other displaced people have been the object of much research related to how people are adapting. Few have focused specifically on women even though women and children are by far the majority of refugees in general and especially in Utah (Utah Refugee Services Office, 2017). One of the few, focused on narratives of newly arrived women refugees (first author, 2018).  Narratives are an important method for hearing authentic lived experiences versus assuming researchers can know the answers. However, questions arose about how those narratives might change after being in the U.S. for a longer period of time. Eleven refugee women who had been in the U.S. longer than 10 years were interviewed for this study. Narratives allowed us to present this scholarship in a way that is accessible to anyone. Five themes were found: language, education, family, assistance, and transition. These themes demonstrate both the resilience of the women and the difficulty and complexity of long-term adaptation.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This essay aims to contribute to the development of invitational rhetorical theory, using the phenomenon of ‘comfort women’– one of the saddest, most controversial, and traditionally silenced pages of the recent world history – as an illustrative case study. By focusing on the relatively recent mediated and special turns in the rhetorical studies, we propose a critical cultural analysis and eventual addendum of mediated texts as well as the rhetoric of materiality as essential means to understand and apply invitational rhetoric. Our project demonstrates how—in a socio-political context of cultural erasure and forgetting—material and visual messages serve as the most invitational modalities. The material and visual rhetoric intervene in the context of strategic amnesia, endurance, and as the center the voices and experiences that historically have been made completely subaltern. Utilizing a selection of artifacts of the rhetoric of materiality and pieces of media rhetoric, we demonstrate how those forms of invitational rhetoric create and encourage safe dialogical spaces for traditionally silenced, marginalized communities. Ultimately, we aim to demonstrate how the new understanding and utilization of invitational rhetoric can become a mechanism for social change and enable a shift in the public consciousness.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The year-long trade war between the U.S. and China has Midwest farmers reeling as sales of agricultural products to a major market was cut in half.

The file is attached to this submission (including tables, figures, and references).<br /><br />Introduction<br />Despite the growing threat posed by extreme groups, little research has focused on the persuasive communication strategies employed by such groups. Whether global jihadi networks, nationalist movements, race supremacists, or anti-government activists, extreme groups rely on persuasive messaging operations, including the spread of conspiracy theories, fake news, calls for radicalization, and racist rhetoric. Many of these efforts have found success using non-traditional avenues such as social media, Internet message boards, and online streaming services (Blaker, 2015; Connelly et al., 2015; Zeitzoff, 2018). As research has found, most extremists are not pathologically, mentally ill (Gage, 2011; Loza, 2007); to the contrary, the majority are quite capable of planning, organizing, and leading groups in complex operations, while giving the appearance of blending in and functioning normally within society. The propaganda efforts by various extremist groups have also been on the rise, and some watchdog groups indicate that those efforts have been quite successful (e.g., ADL, 2019). Thus, a pressing question becomes: What makes extreme, radical messages persuasive, not just to fellow believers but to individuals in otherwise ordinary, mainstream populations?<br /><br />Theoretical Rationale<br />Premised in social identity theory (SIT; Tajifel & Turner, 1986; Turner, Hogg, Oakes, Reicher, & Wetherell, 1987), Hogg’s (2007, 2011, 2014) uncertainty-identity theory (UIT) posits uncertainty about the <i>self<\/i> motivates people to identify with social groups. Within UIT, the self is conceptualized as the “critical organizing principle, referent point, or integrative framework for perceptions, feelings, and behaviors” (Hogg, 2007, p. 77). According to UIT, a potent means of eliminating self-uncertainty is identifying with groups.<br /><br />Not all groups share the same uncertainty-reducing functions, however. As Hogg (2004) notes, groups high in what he terms <i>entitativity <\/i>are better suited to reduce self-uncertainty. In UIT, entitativity is defined as, “the property of a group, resting on clear boundaries, internal homogeneity, social interaction, clear internal structure, common goals, and common fate” (Hogg, 2012, p. 23). Groups high in entitativity are extreme in nature, as such groups favor rigid boundaries, internal homogeneity, and intolerance of dissent. According to UIT, groups high in entitativity should be more attractive to individuals experiencing self-uncertainty given that such groups provide clear identity roles, thereby alleviating self-conceptual uncertainty.<br /><br />The present research examined the persuasive appeal of extreme groups under conditions of self-uncertainty. The guiding theoretical framework, UIT (Hogg, 2007) argues self-uncertainty motivates people to identify with social groups. In this regard, UIT also considers properties of groups, arguing those high in entitativity are extreme in nature and also more attractive to self-uncertain individuals. Given debate within the literature as to whether liberals or conservatives are more prone to identify with extreme groups (Jost & Napier, 2012), ideological congruence between group (sender) and participant (receiver) was also a factor in this research.<br /><br />As Jackson et al. (2019) note, there is consensus among intelligence and law enforcement agencies that greater scrutiny should be paid to the persuasive campaigns of extreme groups to counter domestic and international terrorism. Although recent communication research has considered the appeal of extreme groups from an interpretive lens (Bruscella & Bisel, 2018), such work does not draw on the considerable body of empirical research devoted to understanding the appeal of extreme groups. Thus, the present study applies a communicative socio-scientific approach to examine key information-processing effects occurring when an individual receives a persuasive message from an extreme group under the threat of self-uncertainty.<br /><br />Key Predictions<br />Three main effects: (H1) Perceived group extremism, (H2) self-uncertainty, and (H4) ideology: Extreme group (vs. moderate), self-uncertainty (vs. self-certainty), ideology congruent (vs. incongruent) content results in higher (a) identification, (b) behavioral intentions to act on behalf of the group, (c) perceptions of source credibility, (d) positive attitudes toward the advocated position, and (e) favorable perceptions of message quality.<br /><br />Self-uncertainty x Perceived group interaction (H3): in the extreme group condition, relative to self-certainty, self-uncertainty increases (a) identification, (b) behavioral intentions to act on behalf of the group, (c) perceptions of source credibility, (d) positive attitudes toward the advocated position, and (e) favorable perceptions of message quality, whereas in the moderate condition, there is no difference between self-certainty and self-uncertainty on any of these outcome variables.<br /><br />Method<br />The study employed a 2 (self-uncertainty: self-certainty, self-uncertainty) x 2 (group extremism: high entitativity, low entitativity) x 2 (ideological congruence: congruent, non-congruent) independent group design. Participants (<i>N <\/i>= 423 college students; age: <i>M<\/i> = 20.00, <i>SD<\/i> = 2.53, range: 18-48; 61.2% female) completed an online pretest measuring political ideology before attending a lab session. In the lab, participants read about an ostensible tuition increase, and then were randomly assigned to watch an interview of two moderate or extreme student group leaders responding to the increase, after which participants were primed with self-certainty or uncertainty. The ideology of the group was manipulated by describing the groups as conservative or liberal. Ideology scores from the pre-test were used to create an ideological congruency grouping variable.<br /><br />Discussion of Results<br />Results point to three general conclusions. First, the data offer support for UIT, with self-uncertainty showing a main effect across all outcome variables. Second, self-uncertainty interacted with group extremism, resulting in more favorable attitudes toward positions advocated by an extreme group, as well as more perceived goodwill from the extreme group leaders. Third, ideological congruence between sender and receiver only affected behavioral intentions for liberals and not conservatives. Additionally, the two-way interaction between ideological congruence and group extremism showed greater preference for a moderate congruent group and not an extreme one. Finally, an unexpected main effect for group extremism points to the need for greater scrutiny of source credibility outcomes in future research.<br /><br />Overall, the study results have theoretical and practical implications. In terms of theory testing and development, present research provides a test of UIT and integrates its predictions with persuasion research. Our study is the first to examine persuasion variables in the context of UIT. In terms of practical implications, the study results may inform de-radicalization and anti-terrorism efforts and offer insights to field researchers, practitioners, and law enforcement agencies.\n","Abstract Body: Rural areas consist of a unique sociocultural environment (Moreland et al., 2013; Ulrich-Schad & Duncan, 2018). Social isolation (Cantrell, Valley-Gray, & Cash, 2012), values about self-reliance (Broffman et al., 2017) and social cohesion (Wilson, Wilson, & Usher, 2015), and norms about privacy (Boyd & Parr, 2008; Walker & Raval, 2017) and community gossip (Komiti, Judd, & Jackson, 2006), comprise an intersection of cultural values and social dynamics in rural areas that create a uniquely complex environment of attitudinal barriers (e.g., stigma) to mental health treatment seeking in rural areas.<br /><br />This intersection is poorly understood for two reasons: (1) intersections between stigma and mental health treatment are multifaceted and intricately linked with sociocultural environment and (2) extant rural-nonrural typologies classify rurality resulting from geographic isolation and do not consider rural sociocultural environment. While stigma is communicated via interpersonal interactions (Smith, 2011), stigma is also intimately linked to larger sociocultural norms (Goffman, 1963). As such, establishing an identity as devalued—or stigmatized—is dependent upon the processes that comprise social environments and the group dynamics that facilitate social consensus (Rintamaki & Brashers, 2010). Rural sociocultural norms are particularly important to understanding mental health treatment in rural areas because mental illness is highly stigmatized (Vogel et al., 2006) and individuals are motivated to behave in ways that reinforce positive group distinctions (Giles, Reid, & Harwood, 2010).<br /><br />This study used a social identity approach (Tajfel & Turner, 1986) to understand the relationships among variables that exist on a macro-societal level, yet impact interactions and outcomes that occur on an individual-level. Rural sociocultural context was conceptualized as rural social identity to examine the intergroup dynamics that shape mental health treatment seeking among a rural community sample. A rural orientation toward mental health was conceptualized via attributes of rural identity (<i>stoicism, self-reliance, self-efficacy, PSOC, control<\/i>) to see how these attributes are associated with mental health stigma and how these attributes moderate associations between mental health stigma and treatment seeking intentions. It was hypothesized that links between processes of stigma socialization (perceived family, perceived community mental health stigma), attitudes toward mental health (self-stigma, perceived public stigma), and intentions to seek formal treatment (mental health practitioner, general practitioner) and informal support (semiformal, informal, self-help) vary given attributes of rural identity.  <br /><br />Participants (<i>N<\/i> = 220) were recruited from rural communities in the Midwestern United States. Self-reliance was measured using eight items (Britt et al., 2014; <i>α <\/i>= .75). Self-efficacy was measured using eight items adapted from the Self Rated Abilities for Health Practices Scale (Becker, Stuifbergen, Oh, & Hall, 1993; <i>α <\/i>= .86). Stoicism was assessed using Wagstaff and Rowledge’s (1995) Stoicism Scale (19 items; <i>α <\/i>= .86). Internal locus of control was assessed using seven items from the Internal Health Locus of Control subscale (Wallston & Wallston, 1978; <i>α <\/i>= .74). Psychological sense of community (PSOC) was assessed using the Sense of Community Index (Obst, Smith, & Zinkiewicz, 2002; 19 items; <i>α <\/i>= .83). <br /><br />Self-stigma was measured using items from the Self-Stigma for Seeking Help Scale (Vogel et al., 2006; <i>α<\/i> = .90). Perceived public stigma was assessed using the Perceived Discrimination and Devaluation Scale (Link, 1987; <i>α<\/i> = .76). Perceived family stigma was measured using nine items assessing family-level orientation towards mental health (<i>α <\/i>= .95). Perceived community stigma was measured using items Wrigley, Jackson, Judd, and Komiti’s (2005) scale for community stigma (<i>α<\/i> = .84).<br /><br />Treatment seeking intentions were measured using the General Help-seeking Questionnaire—Vignette Version (Wilson, Dean, Ciarrochi, & Rickwood, 2005). Participants responded to six vignettes and rated intentions to seek help from providers (parent, other family member, close friend, intimate partner, pastor or religious leader, coach or teacher, telephone helpline, support group, general practitioner or family doctor, psychiatrist, counselor, psychologist or therapist, unguided website use, books) using a 7-point scale (1 = <i>extremely unlikely<\/i>, 7 = <i>extremely likely<\/i>). Cronbach’s alpha revealed strong internal consistency for items assessing intentions to seek treatment from formal providers, i.e., mental health practitioner (<i>α<\/i> = .97; psychiatrist, counselor, psychologist or therapist) and general practitioner (<i>α<\/i> = .80; family doctor, general practitioner), as well as from semiformal providers (<i>α<\/i> = .94; coach or teacher, minister or religious leader, support group, telephone helpline/hotline), informal providers (<i>α<\/i> = .93; parent, other family member or close relative, a close friend, intimate partner), and self-help resources (<i>α<\/i> = .94; self-guided web resources, book).<br /><br />Using self-report data, path analysis revealed that family and community stigma increased levels of self-stigma and perceived public stigma (see Table 1 for descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations; Table 2 for standardized path estimates for each type of treatment provider). In addition, self-stigma and public stigma mediated associations between family and community stigma and treatment and support intentions. <br />Conditional process modeling revealed multiple direct and indirect effects in the model moderated by rural identity (PSOC, self-reliance, self-efficacy, stoicism, control). Results demonstrate how a social identity lens can be used to conceptualize rural identity and provide more nuanced explanation of the link between rural cultural norms and mental health treatment seeking behaviors among rural populations. Results show that PSOC, self-reliance, and self-efficacy function to promote and constrain treatment seeking behaviors and play a significant role in determining treatment seeking intentions for specific types of self-help, informal, semiformal, and formal treatment and support providers. <br /><br />Findings demonstrate how intergroup theorizing can be used to understand ways that mental health stigma functions in rural areas to deter mental health care service use. Moreover, findings demonstrate how conceptualizing rurality as a social identity can provide a more holistic understanding of the intersection between macro-level norms that promulgate stigmatized beliefs about mental health and the micro-level behavioral outcomes that shape treatment seeking. Limitations of the present study as well as opportunities for future studies examining the structure of rural identity and how this varies given rural community contexts in different geographic regions are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This paper reports a mixed-methods, inter-group communication study (<i>n<\/i> = 72) of antisocial outgroups. It examined (a) how individuals perceive group membership markers of four antisocial outgroups (grouches, bullies, assholes, and bitches); (b) communication resignation/resistance tendencies when encountering members of these four antisocial outgroups, and (c) the role (if any) that communicators’ sex and dispositional happiness plays in interactions with members of these four antisocial outgroups. Results provide evidence that an intergroup approach to studying antisocial outgroups is conceptually rich. Cluster analysis identified shared and unique group markers of four antisocial outgroups (grouches, bullies, assholes, and bitches) and shows that group markers matter when individuals make communication choices whether to resign/resist, especially when communicating with assholes. Sex of communicator and dispositional happiness were also found to affect resigning/resisting when encountering assholes\n","Abstract Body: In this study, we explored physical and psychological correlates of negative age-based categorization in middle-aged and older adults’ communication. As described by Turner and colleagues (1987), social categorization is based on fit, including normative fit. To the extent that people have negative stereotypes of old age as a time of physical decline, depression, and isolation, we expected that engaging in a greater degree of age-based categorization might be associated with (a) poorer physical health; (b) poorer mental health; and (c) lower levels of perceived social support. Participants were <i>N<\/i> = 316 middle-aged and older adults from the United States. We found that perceived stress, an indicator of mental health, predicted age-based categorization in communication; physical health and social support did not.\n","Abstract Body: The contact space framework (Harwood, 2010) presents an important theoretical refinement to the contact literature by identifying two dimensions on which various contact experiences fall. Drawing upon this work, this paper focuses on the richness dimension to examine whether and how differing levels of mediated contact richness—afforded by different kinds of media—affect intergroup contact outcomes. Two divergent processes are examined: a positive indirect effect of contact richness through increased feelings of closeness, and a negative one through increased feelings of anxiety and threat during the mediated contact experience. Experimental data collected from a Korean adult sample (<i>N<\/i> = 510) show that contact richness afforded by richer forms of media trigger psychological feelings of closeness with the outgroup character, without increasing threat and anxiety during contact. <br />\n","Abstract Body: The present research presents a recent pilot study of German migrants’ identity-based negotiations in the UK in the context of the BREXIT. A feeling of <i>neither here nor there<\/i> arises during the interviews, when a total number of eight participants, residing in different locations in England, were interviewed in February 2019, individually and in one group interview. Spanning an age group from 35 to 65 years, the interviewees give insight into their everyday life experiences as short- and long-term residents in the UK. While some just recently relocated, a few months to a few years ago, others have spent most of their adult life in Britain, counting up to 25 years. These participants express a variety of problems in terms of their identity negotiations, being German in Britain, related to the recent BREXIT discussion.\n","Abstract Body: This research investigates the representation of Venezuelan immigrants in the local media of Roraima, a Brazilian state that borders Venezuela. According to the Human Rights Council of United Nations (2018), Venezuela is suffering an economic, political and humanitarian crisis. As a result, 4.3 million people left the country in this decade (R4V, 2019). It is estimated that 31,949 Venezuelans live in the city of Boa Vista, capital of Roraima, accounting for almost 10% of the city's population (UNICEF, 2019). Some authors have pointed to this migratory wave as one of the largest in recent Latin American history (Hanson, 2018, Almeida & Santi, 2018). In this context, local media play an important role in figuring out events and their social actors. Based on a literature review about local journalism, Nielsen (2015) says that local newspapers coverage of social events and public affairs can help people develop a “sense of community” through sharing experiences (Nielsen, 2015, p. 13-17). Therefore, when writing about Venezuelans in Roraima, local media helps to construct the image of the immigrants, showing where they belong and positioning the audience in relation to them. Media also define relations among different actors (Fairclough, 1995). For instance, by separating groups and identities, media may simplify social relationships to binary opposition of “us” and “them”.<br /><br />According to Hall (2013) identities are representations built on a division, on the place that the “Other” occupies. “Identities are thus points of temporary attachment to the subject positions which discursive practices construct for us” (Hall, 2011, p. 6). In representation processes, some identities may be privileged over others, creating what we call “nodal points”: on one hand we have the ones who possess societal power, and on the other hand the “others” who are defined by the ones who hold power (Laclau & Mouffe, 1985/2001). Therefore, one has to recognize the need to observe which disputes, differences and adversities are behind the discourses that pervade social representations.<br /><br />Vayer and Rocin (1989, p. 60) assert that self-knowledge is, in a way, a dialectical game that characterizes the other’s presence between two poles: similarity and difference. And the perception of these differences takes us to attitudes and behaviors towards the “other”. To exemplify the idea of exclusion on the identification and proximity process, Silva (2000, p.75) claims that when one states that “I am Brazilian”, it means that one is denying a set of other identities and differences. When the difference is too great that obscures the sense of belonging, it becomes an insecurity factor for those who are othered. When it reaches a certain point, this difference becomes a threat to integrity, triggering feelings of rejection and exclusion.<br /><br />To observe the identity aspects and, consequently, the representation of Venezuelan immigrants in the local media, this research uses the methodology of Content Analysis (Bardin, 1977; Neuendorf, 2002), with inferences to the specificities of online media. From September 1st to 14th, 2019, all 445 news stories published on the local website “Folha de Boa Vista”<sup>1<\/sup> were collected. The dataset was divided into two groups: <i>Group A -<\/i> with news whose main theme is migration and <i>Group B –<\/i> with other themes. The purpose of the creation of <i>Group B<\/i> is to observe if immigrants are widely included in the newspaper by participating in the journalistic coverage of other issues that are part of the daily life of Boa Vista, such as education, health, traffic, police, politics, etc. Thus, Group B is divided into two subgroups: <i>Subgroup 1<\/i>, where Venezuelans are inserted as news sources, and <i>Subgroup 2<\/i>, when there is no mention of them.<br /><br />In Group A were registered 11 news stories and in Group B there were 444 in total. In <i>Group B / Subgroup 1<\/i> there were 35 news items and in <i>Subgroup 2<\/i> 409 news stories. Another analysis was conducted about the type of news sources. It was registered 612 sources from the news in the period, between direct and indirect sources. Of these, Venezuelans were direct sources in only 3 occasions and were indirectly cited 30 times.<br /><br />The analysis suggests what we might call \"\"silences” about the migration issue and the incorporation of Venezuelans into local media daily life. This is justified by the low incidence rates of Venezuelans as sources in both <i>Group A<\/i> and <i>Subgroup 1<\/i>. In <i>Group A<\/i> Venezuelans have no voice because they do not act as direct sources. In most cases, they are only cited by representatives of Official Institutions, such as government, churches and NGO. In <i>Group B<\/i>, they usually appear only in hard news about violence. Considering the studies about identity (Vayer & Rocin, 1989; Hall, 2011), in reference to the demarcation between “us” and “them”, it can be stated that Venezuelans’ immigrants, even sharing the same physical space as native Brazilians in the city of Boa Vista (us), are portrayed by the media as “they” - demarcating an identity and a cultural conflict in the symbolic social space. The conclusions point to a reflection on how far the media discourse can contribute to xenophobic actions in the local and regional context from the far North of Brazil. It is necessary to emphasize that the analysis described in this extended abstract is part of a research in progress. Discussion and reflection on the partial results may help in future analysis.<br /><br />[1] “Folha de Boa Vista” news website is produced by a media conglomerate from Roraima state, that includes radio stations, printed newspaper, online news portal and publisher<br /><br />References<br />Almeida, T., & Santi, V.

However, the growing prominence and economic successes of casino and gaming enterprises operated by Native American tribes has put a new spotlight on the historically complex relationships between American Indians and U.S. state governments.<br />Nowhere perhaps, are the challenges more highlighted than in Oklahoma. When it received statehood in 1907, Oklahoma territory had been the unwilling home, initially, of thousands of American Indians forcibly removed from their homelands in other parts of the expanding United States (Debo, 1968). Today, it is the home of 39 federally recognized tribes and holds the second largest population of American Indians in the U.S (Bentley, 2003).<br />In all meaningful ways—politically, legally and culturally--these tribes are recognized as “sovereign” –nations within a nation, empowered by a long history of treaty-making within the United States. Yet, as Indian journalist/editor Paul DeMain speculates, the reality of what it means to be “sovereign” remains complex in the face of overlapping—even dueling—jurisdictions (2012).<br />The purpose of this paper is to explore the communication messages about Indian gaming, state policy, and identity present in a Twitter-based campaign between tribal advocates, who support maintaining the current compact, and those who support the governor’s desire to increase the revenues the state of Oklahoma would receive from this agreement. Through the lenses of Critical Race theory applied to Narrative Policy theory, this project highlights the rhetorical strategies used to construct messages about “us” vs. “them,” Indians vs. Oklahomans, in an attempt to sway policy. While the results of this battle may not be clear until 2020, current analyses of these campaigns show strikingly different communication strategies in their attempts to influence Oklahomans about their respective positions.<br />Background<br />On July 10, 2019, the newly elected governor of Oklahoma (US), Governor Kevin Stitt, held a momentous news conference. In it, he announced his intent to renegotiate the 2005 gaming compact between the state’s 39 Indian tribes and the state, which is set to expire under its current terms December 31, 2019. Stitt offered his rationale for this policy shift based upon the state’s projected fiscal needs (Metzer, July 2019). He added that he had “reached out” to tribal leaders in advance of this media appearance but received no response. In fact, during a radio interview, Stitt acknowledged that his outreach to tribal leaders consisted of phone calls to a select handful of tribe officials the weekend before his announcement, leaving phone messages instead of one-on-one conversation (Halter, 2019).<br /><br />From this awkward media start, the question about whether to re-negotiate the Oklahoma Tribal-State Compact continues to stall officially. Meetings between the governor’s office and tribal liaisons have proved unfruitful. But, the mediated battle to win public sentiment through multiple channels is in full view online, revealing latent stereotypes and struggles over shared resources that evoke historical tensions.<br /><br />Gaming: Some Legal Contexts<br />The 1988 Indian Gaming Revenue Act (IGRA) gave some tribes unprecedented levels of economic independence, which reinforced the less tangible idea of sovereignty. Tribal economies in Florida, New Mexico, California, Wisconsin, New York, and Minnesota have evolved from nearly full dependence on federal funding to nearly complete independence through gaming revenue (Cattelino, 2005; Conner & Taggart, 2009; Light, 2008). Whereas the tribes were granted sovereignty by the U.S. Constitution long before the IGRA was passed, the blossoming economies of gaming nations gave them relatively sudden political influence. State politicians in California (Van Lueven, 2006) Minnesota, New York, and Wisconsin have argued that the tribes were not paying their “fair share” (Light, 2008, p. 228). California’s battle, waged in 2004, inspired then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to infamously declare “the Indians are ripping us off!” (Van Leuven, 2006, p. 1). The IGRA prohibits states from directly taxing tribal gaming revenue but it does allow for state and tribal governments to negotiate payment compacts. In exchange for payments from the tribes, the state is required to provide benefits deemed “appropriate in light of the benefits conferred on the tribe” (Meister, et al., 2009, p. 378).<br /><br /><br /><br />Methods & Results<br />On August 11, 2019, Oklahoma Tribal Compact Facts launched a Twitter account, @TribalFacts, designed to offer a “counterbalance in Oklahoma to the tribes’ vast control of the media dialogue regarding the merits of a fair market gaming compact rate. Little more than a week later, United for Oklahoma launched its Twitter conversation, clearly in response to @TribalFacts, as @UnitedForOK. Its self-stated purpose evoked a commitment to “mutual respect, shared strength and productive partnerships that benefit every Oklahoman.”<br />This analysis examines 152 Tweets from @TribalFacts between August 11, 2019 through October 28, 2019, as well as 37 Tweets from @UnitedForOK during the same period. Coding for both groups of tweets examined semiotic and narrative themes in six categories: <i>Evidence of Visuals, Indigeneity Identity, Policy, Economic descriptors, Numerical Measures, and Gambling<\/i> terms. The researchers tallied the recurring presence of these themes and studied correlations between key terms within these themes, Results highlight striking differences in the narratives created about gaming revenues that emphasized a collective good vs. a sense of victimhood. Finally, by coding for social identity along with policy elements, this study contrasts how differently public narratives can encode race and identity. Implications from this study discuss the mediatization of public discourse, especially within a social media context, and how identity could inform future narrative strategies about policies intending to benefit diverse publics.<br /><br />-end-<br />\n","Abstract Body: How do Facebook Live users react to real-time arrests during racial justice protests? Here we examine a critical case study of digital political discourse after a police-involved shooting in the Southern United States. We employ qualitative content analysis of a sample of real-time comments to understand how Facebook users responded to public manifestations against segregation and centuries-old racial divisions. Preliminary results revealed critical information about interactive deliberation between members of the ingroup (e.g., whites) against members of the outgroup (e.g., blacks). Racial comments, related to racial justice and racial dismissal, largely reflected group-identity differences among users, hindered the civility of the conversation, and altered shared online conversational rules. More broadly, this study illuminates the promise and peril of social media platforms for local political communication, and how social position shapes expression in contentious impromptu dialogues.\n","Abstract Body: Memorable messages play a central role in framing the way individuals perceive and respond to significant periods of their lives. The goal of this study is to investigate how memorable messages frame significant, violently charged social movements. In the summer of 2016, numerous violent racially charged movements swept through the city of Baton Rouge, inciting mass outrage amongst individuals across the country. Here, we investigate how citizens living in the area cognitively processed those events, and how memorable messages from both the event and the social movements influenced perceptions of risk both in the city of Baton Rouge and in their neighborhoods. Results indicate a significant connection between risk and memorable messages, such that negatively valenced memorable messages were associated with increased risk perceptions.\n","Abstract Body: Self-transcendent emotions such as hope and admiration can have powerful effects on our individual well-being: when we are hopeful, we believe that our lives can change for the better, and this feeling of hope can help us to attain our goals. Previous research has shown that exposure to inspirational media can lead to experiencing self-transcendent emotions. However, certain features of an inspirational story may affect the likelihood that positive outcomes might occur, including the ingroup/outgroup status of the individual in the story and the difficulty of the obstacle they have overcome. The results of this study show that both the ingroup/outgroup status and the difficulty of the obstacle can influence the extent to which readers experience hope. Individuals were most hopeful after reading a story about an outgroup member who overcame a relatively easy obstacle. However, those who read about an ingroup member overcoming an easy obstacle reported the <i>least<\/i> amount of hope.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Co-cultural theory posits that disempowered groups must adopt certain communication practices to achieve their goals within dominant structures. Currently, although the theory accounts for senders, receivers, and messages, it has yet to elaborate the role of channel. We conducted semi-structured interviews (<i>N <\/i>= 30) to examine the role of channel in co-cultural communication strategies. Channel affordances predicted the implementation of certain strategies and new strategies were identified, indicating potential extensions of co-cultural theory.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Intergroup communication can be an effective tool to reduce prejudice and improve attitudes towards stigmatized groups (such as immigrants), especially when narrative messages are well crafted. Taking as a reference the research on narrative persuasion and on the psycho-social processes that explain prejudice reduction, an online experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 464) was conducted in which the role of two narrative devices was analyzed with a 2 (audience-character similarity based on social identity: low vs. high) x 2 (narrative voice: first vs. third-person message) between-subjects factorial design. Serial multiple moderated mediation analysis showed that identification with the protagonist (which involves a process of <i>merging<\/i> with a particular case exemplified in a testimonial message) and <i>identity fusion<\/i> experience (that involves individuals identify with the whole group) were processes operating in tandem, allowing to explain how, why and when certain <i>narrative devices<\/i> improved outgroup attitudes, promoted contact intention and encouraged prosocial behaviors towards the stigmatized group. Our work improves the understanding of the mechanisms that explain the impact of narratives in the field of intergroup communication, and demonstrates that certain attributes of this type of messages (narrative devices) can increase their effectiveness.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Using a twin study design, we explored the extent to which affectionate communication is a heritable trait. Participants (<i>N<\/i> = 928) were 464 adult twin pairs (229 monozygotic, 235 dizygotic) who provided data on their affectionate communication behaviors. Through <i>ACE <\/i>modeling, we determined that approximately 47% of the variance in trait expressed affectionate communication is heritable, whereas 23% of the variance of trait received affection was heritable. A bivariate Cholesky decomposition model also revealed that 34.23% of the covariation in expressed and received affection is attributable to additive genetic factors. These results suggest the utility of giving greater attention to genetic and biological influences on communicative behaviors by expanding the scope of communication theory beyond consideration of only environmental influences. That is, communicative traits are more accurately described when accounting for both biological and environmental effects.\n","Abstract Body: The present study examines shame and guilt responses to esteem support messages of varying quality. Participants (<i>N<\/i> = 360) in this experiment were randomly assigned to either a shame or guilt induction. Then, participants were presented with three hypothetical scenarios that might evoke that same shame or guilt feeling: being left by a romantic partner, performing poorly on an exam, and upsetting a friend. Next, participants were directed to a randomization of emotion-focused (EF) and problem-focused (PF) esteem support messages and were asked to rate how the message would affect their feelings of state shame and state guilt. Results revealed that EF messages were more likely to alleviate feelings of shame (in two of three scenarios) than guilt. Additionally, PF messages were more likely to alleviate feelings of shame (in one of the scenarios) than guilt. When comparing the messages to each other, EF messages were better at alleviating both shame and guilt compared to PF messages (in two of the scenarios). Theoretical and pragmatic implications are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Every romantic relationship goes through stressful moments. What happens, however, when stress and conflict begin to override the positive moments in the relationship? Using the theory of resilience and relational load (Afifi et al., 2016) as a framework, this study examined the impact of dating partners’ ongoing relationship maintenance and communal orientation on perceptions of relational load and executive functioning immediately after a stressful conversation in the laboratory. It also explored the aftermath of relational load on romantic partners’ communal orientation and mental health in daily diary logs for five consecutive days following the conversation. The results primarily supported the TRRL in that communal orientation and conflict mediated the association between ongoing relationship maintenance and perceptions of relational load. Greater perceptions of relational load also resulted in diminished feelings of communal orientation during the week after the lab visit. Finally, relational load harmed mental health after the lab visit, but the effect was short-lived.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study seeks to further the Communication Theory of Resilience (Buzzanell, 2010, 2019) by examining how individuals construct a sense of anticipatory resilience through the emplotment of narratives of disruptive life events. Through Boje’s (2001, 2008) postmodern frame of antenarrative, we analyze emplotment in 50 narrative accounts from 25 individuals’ accounts of their own and others’ experiences with disruptive events to further understand how participants made sense of these events and prospectively craft a notion of resilience in light of the possibility of future disruption. Findings suggest a reframed concept of anticipatory resilience as a communicated logic for future resilience and suggest new avenues for antenarrative research outside of organizing contexts.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Social anxiety disorder (SAD), the second most common DSM-IV disorder, has deleterious effects such as lower income, higher rates of unemployment, and other mental health comorbidities. Not surprisingly, SAD individuals are prone to social isolation although they desire interpersonal relationships. To understand when they experience social anxiety and how they cope with it, we focused on uncovering communication safety strategies, which SAD individuals employ to increase their sense of safety. Participants (N=27) were recruited and interviewed. In-depth interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. Uncertainty reduction theory, impression management theory, neuroscience distinctions (i.e., wanting and liking) and “predictive coding” approaches were leveraged in interpreting results. Three themes were discovered with regard to affective situations that induce social anxiety for SAD individuals, and five themes were revealed regarding communication strategies that SAD individuals employ in social situations. Mitigating “prediction errors” seems a key intervention target: Implications and limitations are discussed.<br />Keywords: college students, social anxiety disorder, safety behavior, communication strategies, thematic analysis\n","Abstract Body: Shaken baby syndrome/abusive head trauma (SBS/AHT) is the number one cause of child abuse related deaths in the United States, and a concern worldwide. This study, based on qualitative interviews with 26 parents of SBS/AHT survivors, employs grief management and dialectical theory to explore the ambiguous loss experienced by parents. This study finds parents experience dialectics of acknowledgement-denial, control-helplessness, certainty-uncertainty, guilt-innocence, and openness-closedness which prevent them from fully experiencing grief due to the ambiguity of the loss. Because their child is still alive, and the loss is the experience of raising a formerly healthy child, the ambiguous loss experienced, complicated by dialectics of grief, prevent fully dealing with the grief. Grief management tactics that impact family communication are explored.\n","Abstract Body: According to the Communication Theory of Resilience (CTR; Buzzanell, 2010, 2019), resilience occurs as people reintegrate from disruptive events and construct a new normal through their language use, interactions, and attention to identities. CTR specifies five interrelated processes by which people enact resilience: (a) crafting normalcy (e.g. maintaining and/or creating new routines), (b) affirming identity anchors, (c) maintaining and using communication networks, (d) constructing alternative logics (e.g., reframing and using humor), and (e) foregrounding productive action while backgrounding negative emotions. This paper develops a Communication Resilience Processes (CRP) scale that can be used to assess how people construct resilience in response to a range of disruptive events (e.g., death of a loved one, job loss, divorce). Items were generated and refined via a pilot study as well as with feedback from expert raters. The main study (<i>N<\/i>=303) offers initial support for the 39-item CRP’s reliability and factor structure, convergent/divergent validity, and predictive validity.  Future directions for further validating the CPR and using it to better understand processes that promote or inhibit resilience are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Memorable messages have the ability to influence behavior when they are recalled long after initial exposure. Knowing the topics and sources of the messages that are remembered by, and impact, women on probation and parole can improve the efficacy of criminal justice research, practice, and outreach. To this end, guided by Control Theory, we asked 402 women about memorable messages they received since their terms of probation and parole began. A high percentage of women (<i>n<\/i> = 356; 89%) recalled a memorable message, described it, identified its source, and noted whether it had resulted in behaviors of which they were proud, not proud, or had avoided. Seven categories of message topics emerged. In addition, eleven categories of sources of these memorable messages were found. Previous research on this issue was limited to probation and parole agents as sources.  By expanding the range of possible sources, results indicate a wider range of influential network members beyond probation and parole agents.  This research demonstrates that message topic and source both play roles in determining how memorable messages impacted important behavioral outcomes for women in the criminal justice system.  <br />\n","Abstract Body: Family Communication Patterns (FCP; Koerner & Fitzpatrick, 2002) is a renowned theory in family and interpersonal communication research. This study investigates the significance of conversation and conformity family communication patterns on Thai young adults’ self-esteem and emotional intelligence. Further, the paper also discusses the relationship between conformity FCP and collectivism. 145 young adults in Thailand, who were juniors and seniors in university, participated by completing surveys administered by their instructors. Contrary to previous findings, the surveys revealed that Thai young adults believed their families adhered more to conversation-oriented communication than conformity-oriented communication. Furthermore, conversation orientation showcased no impact on self-esteem but did predict emotional intelligence. However, the notion that conformity is intertwined with collectivist values, was consistent with previous research. These findings add to the expansion of research on FCP by looking at family communication patterns through a less ethnocentric and more inclusive and cultural lens. However, it is crucial to mention the study’s limitations; in order to make more unequivocal conclusions, future research on this topic must include a larger sample size, have more equal gender representation, and consider gathering data from rural areas in Thailand. <br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>family communication patterns, Thailand, self-esteem, emotional intelligence, collectivism\n","Abstract Body: The study of putative secrets is a burgeoning area of inquiry in the context of close relationships, yet little work has been conducted to examine how these secrets function in the family context. Framed by communication privacy management theory, the current study sought to examine the nature of family putative secrets (i.e., topic, valence, intimacy), the ways in which family members discover these secrets, and the relational and communicative outcomes of learning these secrets. Using a cross-sectional design, 214 participants completed an online survey that asked about a current putative secret held by an immediate family member. Three types of putative secrets distinct to families emerged (i.e., relationship ties, abortion, leaving school), and participants reported accidental discovery and revelation by another family member as the most common ways of uncovering the putative secret. Further, results reveal that more negative putative secrets led to increased relational distancing and hurt, and decreased relational satisfaction. However, the putative secret perceiver’s communication efficacy moderated the relationship between secret valence and relational distancing, such that increased efficacy diminished relational distancing, even when putative secret valence was negative. Finally, the findings suggest that individuals are unlikely to confront family members about the putative secret despite discovery method or perceived communication skills, but are more likely to confront if they are feeling especially hurt because a family member is keeping a secret from them. Implications for the discovery of family putative secrets are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Families headed by LGBTQ parents in the United States face social challenges, including heteronormativity in the family context. The current study draws from theorizing of social identity and the discourse-dependence of family identity, examining LGBTQ parents’ communicative and psychological experiences navigating social situations. Thematic analysis of 25 parents’ written responses was conducted. Results demonstrate the persistent salience of non-normative family identity for LGBTQ parents, particularly when navigating public spaces and traveling. Feelings of similarity with other families were less prevalent, occurring primarily in local neighborhoods and during LGBTQ community events. Perceiving family identity difference had adverse psychological effects on parents. To manage social challenges, parents primarily used the strategy <i>ignoring/avoiding<\/i> with non-family members. Parents also enacted <i>labeling<\/i> across psychological response valences. <i>Narrating<\/i> was used to communicate with children about family identity challenges, with children tending to express understanding in response. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: A goal of our research is to understand the kinds of messages and social interactions that are salient for people in their experience of work-family conflict management.  While individuals will experience many different types of tensions or contradictions throughout their lives, tension between managing work responsibilities and family responsibilities emerges as one of the most distressing and enduring challenges that working adults face.  Work-family conflict is comprised of several elements, including time pressures, role strain and role inconsistency, and physical/psychological strain (Kirby, Wieland, & McBride, 2006).  The choices people make to manage the conflict between work and family realms are diverse and communicatively-based (Yoshimura & Heisterkamp, 2019).\n","Abstract Body: Sibling relationships are fertile grounds for the socialization of communication patterns that are both pro- and antisocial in nature. Worrisome are the negative outcomes linked to aggressive experiences that are detrimental to individual health and well-being. The study comprises a national sample from the U.S. in which participants reported on sibling use of specific types of supportive and aggressive messages in a comparative study that examines communication patterns in pre-adulthood to adulthood. The frequency, type, and pattern of use overtime was investigated to test if patterns experienced while growing up are predictive of patterns in adulthood. Results indicate there is a moderate-strong relationship between sibling patterns of use in pre-adulthood to adulthood for both supportive and aggressive message types, with a general decrease in both categories in adulthood. Implications for advancing future work on the impact of sibling communication patterns to better understand the characteristics and factors that shape the socialization process and impact of detrimental effects are discussed.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study aimed to examine the benefits of communication savoring. Based on the consistent findings on the positive psychological benefits of general savoring, it was predicted that communication savoring, a particular form of savoring focused on the language and social interaction aspects of savoring, leads to similar positive outcomes. Using an online quasi-experimental research design, this study examined the immediate effects of communication savoring on positive and negative affect, happiness, and life satisfaction among young adults (N = 86). Further, perceived stress was predicted to moderate the effect of communication savoring on the positive outcomes. The findings showed that participants in the communication savoring intervention group reported less negative affect compared to those in the comparison group. However, no other group differences were observed. Suggestions for future research were provided.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined the relationship between how middle-aged and older adults talk about age and aging in interpersonal conversations and their health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which refers to components of people’s well-being associated with physical and mental health. Participants were <i>N<\/i> = 685 middle aged and older adults in the United States.Controlling for participants’ demographics, perceived social support, and number of chronic conditions, higher levels of age self categorization in communication predicted higher levels of pain and marginally, poorer general health. Higher levels of expressing optimism predicted lower levels of pain, better general health, and higher satisfaction with life. Finally, higher levels of discussing wishes about future health decisions and care predicted higher satisfaction with life.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Several previous studies have connected affectionate behavior to mental and physical health benefits. One outcome not yet adjudicated—yet highly relevant for overall health—is inflammation. The current study asked a small (<i>N <\/i>= 20) sample of healthy young adults to report their daily hugging behaviors over a 14-day period and to collect their saliva at the beginning and end of the study. Based on affection exchange theory, we hypothesized that the frequency of hugging would be inversely related to proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukins (IL) 1-b, 6, and 8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a). Controlling for baseline levels, hugging was significantly and inversely related to IL1-b and TNF-a after the 14-day period. Associations with IL-6 and IL-8, although nonsignificant, were also in the hypothesized direction. Implications for research on the health benefits of interpersonal behavior are offered.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Uncertainty is commonly experienced in everyday life, especially so in illness conditions (e.g., Cohen, 1993; Mishel, 1988). Most of the literature on illness uncertainty (e.g., Mishel, 1988) as well as uncertainty and communication (e.g., Afifi & Weiner, 2004; Brashers, 2001) conceptualizes uncertainty as resulting from information deficiency, suggesting individuals respond to uncertainty by actively engaging in information management and using cognitive and other resources toward that end. More research is needed to understand uncertainty as an affective experience (e.g., Hirsh, Mar, & Peterson, 2012) and how it motivates emotion-focused responses such as support seeking (e.g., Barbee & Cunningham, 1995). Drawing from the theory of motivated information management (TMIM; Afifi & Weiner, 2004), the entropy model of uncertainty (EMU; Hirsh et al., 2012), and support seeking literature (Barbee & Cunningham, 1995), this two-wave study (N = 344) tested the associations among uncertainty, information seeking, and support seeking behaviors in the context of mental health. Preliminary results suggest that uncertainty discrepancy led to more direct social support seeking and less avoidance when individuals felt efficacious. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined the development and evolution of accounts, or narratives people develop to make attributions about events, created by survivors of sexual assault. Through interviews (<i>N<\/i> = 31) we investigated the self-disclosure of these accounts and how accounts varied based on audience and over time. We also examined how recipients responded to these disclosures and how these responses shaped survivors' accounts and subsequent disclosure.\n","Abstract Body: Social networking sites (SNSs) provide a convenient channel for people to exchange social support. This project adopted a mixed-method approach to examine relational and contextual factors that influence people’s intention to provide support on SNSs. Study 1 used a survey method to explore people’s use of SNSs in support exchange. Participants were asked to identify two recent support-seeking posts that they viewed on SNSs, one from a close friend and the other from an acquaintance. The results suggested that Facebook was the most used SNS to seek social support. This study also showed that people were more likely to respond to a close friend’s support-seeking post than to an acquaintance’s post. Built upon the findings in Study 1, Study 2 conducted an experiment to examine the impact of relational closeness and valence of a support seeker’s previous posts on viewers’ appraisal of the support seeker and their intention to provide support. Findings showed that relational closeness between a support seeker and a viewer positively affected liking, responsibility attribution, and intention to support the poster. Further, a support seeker who previously posted much negative content would be less likeable and be attributed more responsibility for their stressor compared with a frequent poster of positive content. However, valence of previous posts did not impact viewers’ intention to support the poster when they were in need of help. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Since Instagram is considered a platform of idealistic content, female users utilize a variety of editing techniques to ensure that their content is picture perfect. Cognitive dissonance is prevalent on Instagram, as users acknowledge that the content that they and other users publish on Instagram can be inauthentic, yet they still use the application. To explore this interdisciplinary phenomenon, twenty interviews were conducted among both freshmen and senior women at a small liberal arts college in the Northeast. Results found that students are secretive about authentic content online, students will engage in resolution models when experiencing cognitive dissonance regarding their online behavior, and positions of power played a role in the acceptance of content online. Vulnerability and comfortability were preconditions for users to post authentic content, and perceptions of content online were dependent upon the experience participants had with social media. Implications of this research provide hope for the future of authenticity on the small screen and in reality.<br />Keywords: cognitive dissonance, social media, photo-editing habits, Instagram, power, authenticity\n","Abstract Body: The smartphone has become a ubiquitous device in our daily lives and, among different functionalities, instant messaging remains the most popular and used one. Past research has investigated the differential effects of online and offline communication, however, the majority of the studies treated online communication as a black box. Using an experimental design, the present study manipulated three aspects of smartphone-mediated communication, i.e. its synchronicity, modality, and valence, to investigate whether these aspects have an impact on several aspects of the psychosocial functioning, namely interpersonal trust, social support, and personality attribution, through the mediation of perceived and subjective social presence. The data, coming from 160 young adults who took part in the experiment, were analyzed using a Structural Equation Modeling approach. Examination of path coefficients yielded evidence for the hypothesized paths with few exceptions. The valence of the message, i.e. empathic accurate vs. empathic inaccurate messages, and its modality, i.e. messages with or without emojis, significantly predicted both subjective and perceived social presence. Furthermore, synchronicity predicted perceived but not subjective social presence. Subjective and perceived social presence were positively associated with perceived social support, while personality attribution was positively associated with subjective but not with perceived social presence. Social presence was not significantly related to interpersonal trust. Overall, in can be concluded that both what is said <i>and<\/i> how it is said impact the quality of interpersonal relations in terms of perceived social support and positive evaluation of the communication partner in smartphone-mediated communication.\n","Abstract Body: Guided by the uses and gratifications theory (Katz, Blumler, & Gurevitch, 1973) and the goals-planning-action model of interpersonal influence (Dillard, 1990), two studies are presented to examine aspects of dating app communication. Study 1 (<i>N <\/i>= 526) investigates proximal relations between a personality trait and motives as well as motives and behavioral intent. Study 2 (<i>N<\/i> = 200) further probes elements of study 1 in a new sample and investigates new personality traits in relation to motives. Collectively, these studies provide an initial look at and explanations of the relations between personality traits, motives, and behavioral intent, which serve to advance understanding of dating app use from an interpersonal communication perspective. Implications, limitations, and future directions are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates the relationship between the use of emojis and perceived likability of the sender. A 2 (emoji valence: positive vs. negative) x 2 (message valence: positive vs. negative) x 2 (message repetition) mixed experimental design was conducted among participants aged between 21 and 35 (<i>N<\/i> = 206). Results aligned with prior research as senders of positive emojis and positive texts were rated higher in perceived likability than senders of negative emojis and negative texts. In addition, perceived similarity was found to mediate the link between emoji valence and perceived likability.<br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>emojis, perceived likability, perceived similarity, emoji valence, text valence, text messaging, computer-mediated communication\n","Abstract Body: As the prevalence of technology has grown, so too has scholars’ interest in its impact. The present manuscript examines technology use impact on the fulfillment of affection, inclusion, and control in interpersonal relationships. Hierarchical regressions were estimated to examine whether control moderated the relationship between technology use and affection as well as technology use and inclusion. Results indicate that control moderated the relationship between affection and technology use. Interpersonal, mass communcation, and human-computer interaction lenses provide implications for this study. Attachment theory, transformed social interaction, self determination theory, and feedback each help explain how varying degrees of control differentially impact affection.\n","Abstract Body: Despite wide recognition that youth spend a significant amount of time communicating on social media, the literature is mixed when assessing the offline interpersonal impact of such time spent. This systematic review aimed to synthesise evidence on the associations between social media use and offline interpersonal outcomes in youth. A review of the literature across seven databases was conducted. Eligible studies examined interpersonal outcomes and social media use in young people aged 10-24 years. A quality assessment of methodological features was applied to the studies. Forty-nine eligible studies were identified. Impact findings are synthesised according to type of offline interpersonal outcome (relationship quality, individual attribute, group based, and offline behaviour). The most consistent findings regarding interpersonal challenges associated with social media use across the included studies were alienation from peers, family, and school, relational aggression, relationship quality with parent, and perceived isolation. The most consistent findings regarding interpersonal benefits associated with social media use were sense of belonging, social capital, offline social interaction, and degree of offline socializing. Particular attention is also given to inconsistent measurement approaches to social media use and interpersonal outcome variables. Methodological, theoretical, and future research recommendations are made as a result of literature review findings.<br />\n","Abstract Body: With the world population aging, psychological well-being among older adults has become one of the key concerns along with their physical well-being. As the number of older adults using social media is increasing, recent studies show that social networking online has similar benefits as retaining social networks offline. Moreover, online social networking bears significant meaning as social interactions among older adults decrease over time. This study aims to investigate the relationship between interpersonal communication via social media, digital media literacy, and psychological well-being among older adults. 150 older adults over the age of 60 residing in Korea, consisting of each gender equally, were interviewed. Digital media literacy in this study, includes internet literacy, self-expressing activities and relationship maintenance activities whereas psychological well-being primarily included subdimensions of environmental mastery and positive relationship with others. First, we found a positive relationship between the extent of interpersonal communication via social media and overall psychological well-being. Second, men showed a stronger relationship between interpersonal communication via social media and positive relationships with others. Overall, our study suggests that the activity theory of aging can also be applied to interpersonal communication via social media, providing evidence that could expand the theory.<br /><br /><br />Keyword : older adults, social media, psychological well-being, interpersonal communication, activity theory, digital media literacy, gender\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates ghosting, the unilateral disengagement or breakup strategy used to terminate communication via one or multiple media. Applying two theoretical frameworks, Media Richness Theory (MRT) and the Channel Expansion Theory (CET), across two studies, we tested the interplay between sociotechnical and socioemotional processes of channel richness. Employing MRT in Study I, non-initiators (N = 189) reported first observed being ghosted on multiple media rather than on only one channel, with texting being the most frequently used. The channels coded with more richness, reduced suffering for non-initiators of ghosting. Using CET in Study II, non-initiators (N = 169) reported face-to-face communication as the most hurtful, yet texting caused the most suffering. Findings highlight how channel selection may change non-initiator expectations. Together, these studies found message channels carry an interaction, which highlights static and perceived channel richness.\n","Abstract Body: In China, marriage is regarded as the most important thing in life. Parents always get involved in their children’s life decisions on marriage. Nowadays, with the industrialization and modernization of Chinese society, more and more urban young adults delay marriage for career development, failing to meet their parents’ expectation. Intergenerational conflicts thus become common in China while seldom studied. Under the perspective of grounded theory, we conducted 16 in-depth interviews with unmarried young adults so as to disclose the pattern of parent-child conflict communication. The findings indicate that (1.) as the manifestation of Chinese culture within family context, conflict avoidance and compromise are still the dominant patterns the interviewees adopt in handling the marriage-related issues they had with their parents, (2.) thus most of the interviewees are trapped by the \"\"infinite loop\"\"—parents who are unsatisfied with their children’s boundary defense will push harder next time and make further avoidance or compromise more difficult, which in the long run may result in an increasingly estrangement or a breakdown of parent-child relationship; (3.) nevertheless, there are some interviewees shifting their positions from boundary defense to open communication, treating conflicts as an opportunity for breaking the loop and making themselves better understood by their parents. The implications of above findings for Chinese parent-child conflict management are discussed in this study.\n","Abstract Body: Maintaining good mental health is important for assuring an individual’s well-being during the entire course of life. Individuals learn self-regulation abilities, such as self-efficacy and locus of control, during childhood through parental modeling (Bandura, 1986). Both self-efficacy and locus of control are incorporated in the concept of Self-Mastery (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978) which has been found to be a valid predictor of mental health in both youth and adulthood (Infurna & Mayer, 2015; Oi & Alwin, 2017). Moreover, it was found that self-mastery is associated with ability to cope with stressful situations during adulthood (Bollini, Walker, Hamann, & Kestler, 2004; Korten, Comijs, Penninx, & Deeg, 2016; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) and that stress is detrimental for health (Brosschot, Gerin, & Taylor, 2006; Slavich, 2016).<br />One gap in the literature is the lack of consideration about the mutual influence between parents and their adolescent children. If self-mastery develops through parental modeling (Bandura, 1986; Clark & Zimmerman, 1990), research should measure the parental influence on their children. Moreover, since children are active partners in the relation with their parents, especially during adolescence, it should be expected that the influence would be mutual/reciprocal (from parents to children, and vice versa) instead of one-way direction (from parents to children). Therefore, the present study aims to analyze the relations among self-mastery, ability to cope with stress, and health, the analyzing the mutual influences between parents and their adolescent children applying the Actor Partner Interdependence Model extended Mediation analysis (APIMeM; Ackerman, Ledermann & Kenny, 2010; Coutts, Hayes, & Jiang, 2019; Lederman, Siegfried, & Kenny, 2011). With the APIMeM four actor effects, two direct and two indirect, and four partner effects, two direct and two indirect, can be estimated. The actor effects estimate whether the X variable of a person influences his/her score on the Y variable, directly or through the mediation of a mediator M. The partner effects estimate whether the X variable of a person influences the score of the partner’s Y variable, directly or through the mediation of a mediator M. Partner effect allows the exploration of the interdependency across partners of a dyad (see Kenny, Kashy, & Cook, 2006). Figure 1 shows the theoretical model tested. We expected to find both significant actor and partner effects.<br />Data came from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP; see Tillman et al., 2016) collected on 2015, 2016, and 2017 (following T1, T2, and T3). The sample was composed of 178 individuals (89 dyads; M<sub>adolescents<\/sub> = 14.47, SD = .50, age range 14-15; M<sub>parents<\/sub>= 47.24, SD = 4.54, age range 37-58).<br />Measures of self-mastery (Levy, Guye, Kaufamann, 1997; Strodtbeck, 1958; Rosenberg, 1965), coping ability to manage stress (Cohen, Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983), and mental health was collected. Adolescents’ high self-mastery increases mental health both directly (b = .45, p < .001) and indirectly (b = .69, p <.001) through the mediation of the coping ability to manage stress (b=.16, p<.05). Likewise, parents’ self-mastery significantly predicted their mental health (b = .38, p < .001) through the mediation of the coping ability to manage stress (b = .94, p < .001). The paths were controlled for gender, mental health measured at T2, and parental educational level. Parents with high level of education had children with higher ability to manage stress. Likewise, being a mother positively influences the same variable. Our findings confirmed that self-mastery longitudinally promotes mental health, both through a direct link and through the mediation of coping ability to manage stress. We also found that, in a group of adolescents and their parents, the effect of self-mastery on mental health does not pass through the other in the relation (i.e., parental self-mastery does not influence adolescents’ mental health), even if it is co-constructed through interactions with significant others. Likewise, adolescents’ self-mastery does not influence parental mental health. This could be explained by the fact that during childhood parents are the primary significant others who children model their behavior on, whereas, during adolescence, significant influences derive from outside the family, and especially from peers (see Siegel, 2014). By contrast, personal traits, once developed, become stable over time (Oi & Alwin, 2017). We also found that high parental level of education positively influences adolescents’ coping ability to manage stress, as previously demonstrated (Mirosky & Ross, 1998). Moreover, mothers, compared to fathers, had children with higher perceived coping ability to control stress, as previously found (Lansing et al., 2017). Further research should estimate the same model during childhood, which is a period of life in which personality traits develop and the parental influence is even more important than adolescence. Hence, a deeper understanding of these phenomena can provide specific guidelines for intervention due to the role played by self-mastery in assuring good mental health (Infurna & Mayer, 2015; Oi & Alwin, 2017).<br />\n","Abstract Body: Moving from the traditional approach which assumes parents as responsible for overparenting toward a relational approach investigating both parents’ and children’s roles in overparenting, this study examined the relationship between parent-child attachment and overparenting. Relying on data collected from 213 parent-emerging adult child dyads, multiple regression results showed parents’ attachment anxiety with their children positively predicted overparenting, and parents’ attachment avoidance negatively predicted overparenting. Additionally, a positive association was observed between children’s attachment avoidance with their parents and overparenting. The results indicate parental insecure attachment with their children as one possible antecedent to overparenting. In contrast, children’s attachment with their parents has limited influence on overparenting.\n","Abstract Body: Employing both interpretive thematic and Foucauldian critical analyses, this study analyzes 33 interviews with rural-urban migrant workers in China who have experienced long-term separation from their children. In addition to identifying themes central to participants’ construction of parent-child separation, the study uncovers larger social discourses that produce the migrant parent subject, including migrants as “internal aliens,” left-behind children as problematic kids, and family resilience as the solution to structural injustice.\n","Abstract Body: In-laws are often viewed with a very negative stereotype and routinely characterized in the media as negative, complex, and challenging; depicting the in-law in a very destructive fashion. While most research has focused on the negative aspects of the relationship between children-in-law and parents-in-law, in present study I examined positive in-law relationships from the perspective of the children-in-law. I used a turning points methodology to represent how the relationship has changed throughout the course of their marriage and utilized Communication Privacy Management Theory to better examine how children-in-law are creating, negotiating, and attempting to maintain a positive relationship with their parent-in-law. This study represents the second half of my dissertation research, where I analyzed how children-in-law managed times when boundary turbulence was present with their parent-in-law to better understand how they attempted to build and maintain positivity within their relationship at those times and after.\n","Abstract Body: First-year college students undergo a transition period leaving their homes and moving to college. Our study uses data from the First Years Away from Home Program. Parent-student dyads were randomized into three conditions; control, parent handbook, and parent handbook plus. The parents in the handbook plus condition periodically received booster text/email messages. Specifically, we examined how often parents read the text/emails, how often they consulted the handbook as a result of receiving the messages, and how often they contacted the students as a result of the messages. We also examined how often parents found these messages useful for their interpersonal communication. Additionally, we examined the percentage of parents who did not want to receive the messages and discuss the feedback from these parents. Findings show majority of the parents reacted positively to the booster messages. Our findings are impactful in understanding interpersonal communication between parents and first year college students.\n","Abstract Body: Although males are the primary vector of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), college males have been understudied in promoting the HPV vaccination. The present study has looked into the role of perceived injunctive norms from parents and different communication orientations on the college males’ intention to talk with their parents about the HPV vaccination and their intention to get vaccinated against HPV in the near future. College males (<i>n <\/i>= 198) from the United States participated in the online survey. Indirect effect of perceived parental injunctive norms on behavioral intention was statistically significant via college males’ intention to talk with parents about the HPV vaccination. Also, the normative effect on participants’ intention to communicate with parents was positively moderated by conversation orientation. In sum, the present study suggests that family discussion is a key mechanism of parental injunctive norms. And open communication style between parents and college males strengthens the normative effects.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Little research has examined the content of coming out conversations and how the interactions unfold. This study conducted a content analysis of 262 LGB participants’ written narratives of their first coming out experiences. Eight themes emerged from the data and compose scripts of different coming out conversations. In pre-planned coming out, individuals engaged in initiating (setting up a situation to start the disclosure), preparing (getting self and others ready for the disclosure), revealing (breaking the news), elaborating (providing more information about their sexualities), concluding (ending the conversations). In emergent coming out, people start a daily conversation with receivers (conversing) and then reveal, elaborate, and conclude the disclosure. In forced coming out, individuals respond to others’ confrontations about sexualities (responding), followed by revealing, elaborating, and concluding. In sexual/romantic coming out, people engage in same-sex activities (sexing) to reveal their identities. Preparing and elaborating were correlated with better psychological outcomes.\n","Abstract Body: Building new social networks with connections is especially important for freshmen to deal with the transition to college. The goal of the current study was to investigate the link between congruence in extroversion and the interaction frequency within cross-sex classmate dyads on SNSs. Based on a cross-sectional study among 371 cross-sex freshmen dyads (<i>M<\/i><sub>age<\/sub> = 18; <i>SD<\/i> = 2.08 ), using polynomial regression with response surface analysis, we found that (1) dyads with congruent levels of extroversion indeed interacted more frequently online than dyads with incongruent levels of extroversion; (2) Extroverted dyads interacted more frequently online than introverted dyads; (3) Dyads with higher levels of incongruence on extroversion had lower frequency of online interaction. The discussion focused on the potential explanations from <i>the reward of the interaction model<\/i> and the <i>expectations for cross-sex friendship<\/i>.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: extroversion, social networking sites, cross-sex friendship, congruence, freshman, dyadic analysis.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The study examines compliance gaining and communication accommodation in mediated conversations to address social influence processes amid the merger of mass and interpersonal communication. We adopt Goffman’s theory of interaction ritual to advance a theoretical link between accommodation and compliance regarding features of today’s mediated encounters. We conducted an online experiment of compliance-gaining conversation with 915 dyads of strangers recruited from Amazon M-Turk. The extent to which these strangers accommodated each other’s non-content linguistic features predicted their behavioral compliance––monetary donation to charity. This accommodation–compliance link (a) occurred mutually in dyads despite a seeker–target role assignment, (b) was partially mediated by perceived warmth and competence, and (c) was robust against alternative mechanisms including compliance-gaining strategies, personality, and demographics. We discuss implications regarding communication-induced influence in mediated encounters through the lens of interaction rituals.\n","Abstract Body: This study builds upon research on interpersonal advice and extends theory and methodology from interpersonal communication to compare human-human and human-machine communication. Participants were randomly assigned to make a series of forecasts dealing with either humanitarian relief planning (low demonstrability) or organizational operations management (high demonstrability). In each condition, they received advice from either a machine advisor only, a human advisor only, or their advisor human/machine was replaced with the other type of advisor midway through the experiment. Machine advisors were trusted more at the start of the low demonstrability task, but there was no effect of advisor replacement on trust. Decision-makers rated humans as more expert, delivering more useful advice, and as more similar in thought and value similarity to the decision maker than the machine advisor. These perception effects were strongest when a human advisor was replaced by automation. Decision makers experience more negative emotions, lower feelings of reciprocity, and more desire to fault their advisor for mistakes when automation replaces a human. Results are related to other research comparing interpersonal and human-machine communication and are situated in communication theory.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This project investigates how women in India share symptoms they experience along with menstruation with others while wanting to main privacy around it in wake of cultural taboos. By using Communicatioon Privacy Management theory, this reseacrh in progress has revealed preliminary findings where women experience gendered and cultural dialectical tensions.\n","Abstract Body: More traditional forms of pornography use are consistently studied in the context of committed relationships and are mostly associated with negative effects. Much of the research is conducted on flat screen (FS) pornography consumption. Virtual reality (VR) pornography is increasingly popular and little is known about how the impacts of VR and FS pornography consumption differ. The current study addresses differences in relationship satisfaction for users of VR and FS formats. Additionally, perceptions of infidelity and feelings of guilt are analyzed as mediators in the relationship between pornography medium and relationship satisfaction. An exploratory online experiment was conducted with adult males (<i>N<\/i> = 50). Participants were randomly assigned to view a pornographic video in either a VR or FS format. Measures of relationship satisfaction, feelings of infidelity, and feelings of guilt were measured in a follow-up survey. Results suggest that consuming VR pornography led to less relationship satisfaction compared to those who consumed FS pornography. Neither infidelity nor guilt were significant mediators of this relationship. More work is needed to uncover the mechanisms that explain why there may be porn medium differences in relationship satisfaction.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the impact of vocal fillers on perceived credibility, communication competence, and interpersonal attraction in the context of an interview. Previous studies indicate that vocal fillers may decrease professional credibility and discredit communication competence. A 2 x 2 factorial experimental design was constructed (N = 145) in which four audio recordings contained responses to an interview question; the number of vocal fillers (absent or many) and the gender of the speaker (female or male) were manipulated. Results indicated that vocal fillers had a negative impact on all outcome variables. However, males listening to candidates using vocal fillers perceived them significantly more negatively than females listening to candidates using vocal fillers (for professional credibility, personal credibility, and communication competence). This suggests that male evaluators were generally more critical when candidates used vocal fillers in comparison to female evaluators.\n","Abstract Body: <br />Social Appearance Anxiety (SAA), perceived by individuals when others evaluate them in terms of physical appearance, can affect adolescents’ well-being.  Literature highlights the protective role of self-esteem and social closeness in decreasing SAA. In accordance with Seiffge-Krenke’s model, these internal and external factors contribute to the development of coping strategies that can be adaptive (e.g., problem solving, benefit finding, perspective taking) or maladaptive (e.g., rumination, self-blame). The aim of the present study is to investigate the longitudinal relationship between self-esteem, social closeness, and SAA by considering the partially mediating role of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies, in a sample of 1085 early adolescents.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Previous research reveals inconsistent findings with regard to whether smartphone use enhances or displaces interpersonal face-to-face (FtF) communication. We argue that the occurrence of enhancement or displacement effects is contingent on the specific type of smartphone use. Specifically, we tested how adults’ communicative and passive smartphone use influences the quantity and quality of FtF communication with family and friends. Results of a two-wave panel survey (<i>N<\/i><sub>Time2<\/sub>= 461) revealed a positive influence of communicative smartphone use on quantity of FtF communication with friends but not with family members. The quality of FtF communication with close ties, however, was not influenced by communicative smartphone use. Our study partially supported an enhancement effect. Contradicting the displacement hypothesis, we found no influence of passive smartphone use on quantity and quality of interpersonal FtF communication with close ties.\n","Abstract Body: The present research examines how the ways in which people mentally represent their personal networks affect in-the-moment perceptions of social support. Using a fixed name-generator approach, Study 1 showed that the density of chronically activated networks predicted perceived support in both emotional and informational domains. Study 2 assigned participants to think of a dense or sparse personal network of equal size to test whether experimentally-manipulated density can influence perceived support. Results indicated that thinking of a dense (vs. sparse) network led to higher perceived support, which in turn, promoted more confidence in coping with life stressors. This effect was partly explained by the tendency to view a dense (vs. sparse) network as one entity and as part of one’s identity. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that activated social network density may enhance perceived support and explicate key psychological mechanisms tied to cognitive social structures.\n","Abstract Body: Social penetration theory postulates that relationships become more intimate through disclosure. One outcome of relationships becoming more intimate is the exchange of social support. This study investigates the five people undergraduate students feel closest to and how communication characteristics (e.g., frequency of interactions, channel multiplexity, self-disclosure, and social support) differ across and within the five people. Findings indicate mothers and romantic partners are students’ closest relationships, and that frequency of communication decreases as a person becomes less close, but channel multiplexity remains stable, except for when compared to the closest person. Significant differences in homophily, self-disclosure, and social support exist within and across the five people. Finally, there is partial support for the hypothesized path model where homophily directly predicts self-disclosure and social support, and self-disclosure directly predicts social support.\n","Abstract Body: Research has proven that the normative influence of peers can change child and adolescent behavior. However, there is still little theoretical and empirical knowledge about the development of social norms. The present study helps to fill this gap with a longitudinal examination of perceived peer norms during the period of early adolescence. Particularly, it was hypothesized that the perceived prevalence of peer aggression (descriptive norm) may have an impact on the development of the perceived peer approval of aggressive behavior (injunctive norms). To test this hypothesis we used data resulting from the first 4 waves of a longitudinal study involving 101 classes randomly selected from 36 middle schools in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland. Results from a multilevel analysis conducted on a sample of 1748 adolescents reveal that perceived peer approval of aggressive behaviors significantly increased over the two years of study, and the predicting role of descriptive norms in this development was confirmed: higher perceived prevalence of peer aggression was significantly associated with more positive injunctive norms both at baseline and over time. Although gender was found to determine different initial levels of perceived approval of aggression, differences in their developmental paths were not significant. Discussion focuses on the relationship between injunctive and descriptive norms, introducing further potential predictors of their development.\n","Abstract Body: Previous studies suggest that network density acts as the antecedent of supportive interaction. However, how density of a communication network influences support process remains unanswered. This study aims to examine the relationship between network density and supportive interaction in a peer support context. Across the fall semester, 105 students in a undergraduate communication course participated two supportive interactions respectively in a high-density group and a low-density group. Results suggest that network density significantly predict support exchange and support outcomes, moderating by individual difference of needs for companionship. In particular, when people have high intention to build connections, a high-density network predicts higher received emotional support, lower emotional support gap, and more perceived in-group homophily. In addition, network density has impact on individuals’ psychological and behavioral outcomes. Individuals with high companionship needs benefit more in the high-density group, show higher self-efficacy towards exam and have better exam performance.<br />\n","Abstract Body: A large body of research on romantic relationship focused on matching effect within dyadic partners, as the matching perspective could reveal the interdependence and interplay between partners. Yet, how attachment matching relates to relationship quality has yielded inconsistent findings. The present study investigated the links between dyadic matching of attachment and relationship quality among 538 dating couples and 874 married couples. We found that congruence in anxiety relates to higher relationship quality compared with discrepancy in anxiety. Particularly, the association between congruence in anxiety and relationship quality represented a U-shaped curve, indicating dyads with two highly anxious partners could cultivate a rather great relationship. However, regarding avoidance, dyads with larger discrepancy in avoidance were associated with higher relationship quality compared with dyads with smaller discrepancy. Discussion focused on the dyadic regulation effect, especially the buffering and thriving effect for dyads with insecure partners.\n","Abstract Body: The current study investigated how communication strategies are associated with weight management, personal, and relational outcomes. It also examined how communication strategies and weight management outcomes were related to the type of diet/exercise related goal and reliance on one’s partner for support. As anticipated, findings revealed that those who received partner support (particularly in the form of instrumental influence and encouragement) were satisfied with the progress of their goal, whereas those who were undermined were unhappy with their goal progression. When assessing personal outcomes, those who received positive support messages did not necessarily have lower appearance anxiety in self. Though, coercive support and undermining tactics from partner predicted high appearance anxiety. Third, partners pursuing diet/exercise goals to lose weight, as opposed to other objectives, talked about their goals and received more positive support from their significant other. Lastly, those who relied on their partner felt less satisfied with their goal, less motivated and accomplished towards their goal, and experienced higher levels of appearance anxiety than those who sought support from a greater social network.\n","Abstract Body: Gaslighting has gained significant conceptual traction in contemporary discourse. The present study offers an empirical account of the relational preconditions and outcomes of gaslighting understood as an abusive interpersonal dynamic. Survey data on individuals in romantic relationships (<i>N <\/i>= 295) examined how unequal power relations enable gaslighting to emerge and how that dynamic is associated with reduced relational satisfaction and trust. Results indicate that low-powered and high-powered individuals experience high levels of gaslighting victimization, and gaslighting is a form of dominance that affords relational partners the ability to control each other or the relationship. Additionally, results support the counter-theoretical notion that men are victims of gaslighting more than women. Implications, future directions, and limitations are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Using a name generator, 620 non-depressed and 382 self-reported clinically depressed participants nominated people to whom they confide when they experienced difficult situations in the past three months. We compared the differences in the “confidant networks” of the clinically depressed versus non-depressed individuals. Results show that clinically depressed participants have more centralized, but less cohesive confidant networks compared to those of the non-depressed. Subsequent analyses pointed to the importance of at least three factors in improving depression: (1) actively seeking confidants (high centralization), (2) having a well-connected confidant network from which one can draw support (high cohesion), and (3) having a network within which confidants can communicate and form a “safetynet” for the ego (more “constrained” network). This study contributes to further identifying the link between social relationships and depressive symptoms as well as the importance of designing social relationship interventions for the clinically depressed.\n","Abstract Body: Questioning the presence of consent in a sexual encounter can result in both people suffering confusion and long-term effects of trauma and distrust. Traditional gender norms, sexual scripts, token resistance, and rape myths contribute to the challenge of identifying consent. Because of these clashes, consent is seen as a grey area. The BDSM (Bondage, Dominance, Sadism, and Masochism) culture embeds within it consent practices that do not see consent as a grey area but rather black and white. The purpose of this study is to explore the ways the BDSM culture communicates consent in their interactions. Twelve interviews were conducted with BDSM practitioners and findings relating to communicating consent verbally and nonverbally from the self and identifying consent verbally and nonverbally from others emerged from the data. Future directions from these results include an analysis of power difference in communicating consent and the differences between giving, gaining, and revoking consent.\n","Abstract Body: China’s family planning policy has historically silenced the voices of unwed single mothers in their own reproductive discourse, always at the expense of their reproductive health and overall wellbeing. In particular, unwed childbirth is penalized by the government and such pushes the women to seek support in the realm of interpersonal relations. Drawing on Risman’s theoretical framework of gender structure, this article explores the ways in which macro gender norms and expectations are played out for the unwed single mothers within interpersonal relationships. Specifically, through thirty interviews this study explored the ways in which macro gender roles and expectations are communicated in interpersonal spaces. The findings emphasize the complicated ways in which gender structure is enacted within relational contexts. In this way, a woman’s experience of motherhood is deeply interwoven with her fulfillment of other gendered identities, such as daughter, daughter-in-law and wife. These ideas connect with the Chinese discourse of gender roles and expectations.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Women who experience infertility are often confronted with uncertainty about their identity as a woman, wife, or mother. This study examined the ways that women’s identities are changed, disrupted, or challenged in response to reproductive hardship. Women coping with infertility (<i>N <\/i>= 146) wrote narrative responses to a question asking them about the ways their experience of infertility affected their identity. A preliminary content analysis identified themes of identity change or challenge in the responses. A secondary analysis drew upon communication theory of identity as a framework for organizing the resulting themes with regard to the personal, enactment, relational, and communal layers of identity and the identity gaps that participants experienced across layers of identity as they confronted their infertility. Results are discussed in terms of the identity implications for women experiencing infertility and the strategies they can use to cope with identity challenges under these circumstances.\n","Abstract Body: Objectification theory posits that individuals who come to evaluate themselves as objects, rather than people, tend to experience negative <i>intra<\/i>personal consequences, such as anxiety, depression, and eating disorders (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). Although recent research has begun to illustrate the <i>inter<\/i>personal consequences of self-objectification, more progress is needed to understand how self-objectification may be detrimental to interpersonal interactions and relationships. Thus, the present study aimed to extend the existing literature on intra and interpersonal consequences of self-objectification. Data were collected from 196 college students (<i>M<\/i>= 22.21 years, <i>SD <\/i>= 4.36, 67.9% female). Results showed negative impacts of self-objectification on relational initiation, withdrawal, and positive relationships with peers. In addition, self-objectification was positively associated with attachment anxiety and avoidance in romantic contexts. Further, two intrapersonal outcomes of self-objectification (i.e., low self-esteem and high perceived stress) explained the associations between self-objectification and the observed relational outcomes. The findings suggest that evaluating oneself solely based on the way they look is a key predictor and barrier to positive interpersonal experiences.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The study assesses the moderating effects of communication media (face-to-face vs. instant messaging) on the intrapersonal and interpersonal effects of two contrastive, discrete emotions (anger vs. compassion) on dispute resolution tactics and relational outcomes. Participants formed same-sex negotiation dyads to resolve a dispute between roommates either face-to-face or via WeChat, an instant messaging tool. Results showed that distrust mediated the effect of anger on power-based, right-based, and face-threatening dispute resolution tactics in FtF but not CMC negotiations, whereas trust mediated the effect of compassion on interest-based, face-enhancing dispute resolution tactics in CMC but not FtF negotiations. Overall, participants reported more compassion, trust, and dispute resolution tactics in FtF than CMC negotiations. Theoretical and practical implications of these findngs are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Even though Socioemotional Selectivity Theory (SST; Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999) suggests a novel perspective on goals by claiming future time perspective (FTP) is a key element in pursuing goals, previous research of the theory is limited in that i) it adopts relatively indirect measure of goal pursuit, and ii) it takes a passive stance on goal pursuit by highlighting FTP as an external force affecting goal pursuit. Addressing the limitations, we conducted a 2 (FTP: limited vs. expansive) x 2 (scenario: 1 vs. 2) x 3 (interaction time: 30 minutes vs. 3 hours vs. 3 days) experiment to examine how individuals’ agency (i.e., affective motivation and ability) affects social partner selection and social goal pursuit, independently from and interacting with FTP. We found that affective motivation and ability positively predict close tie selection and emotional goal pursuit, and the effects of motivation and ability on close tie selection become weaker when FTP is limited. Our findings confirm and complement SST by suggesting that social tie selection and social goal pursuit are intricate processes where perceived social ending and individuals’ agency interplay together.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study used objectification theory and Vangelisit’s (1994) types of hurt categories to explore “skinny shaming”, or hurtful messages individuals receive for being perceived as too thin. It also investigated the types of relationships individuals’ experience “skinny shaming” from, as well as perceived hurt and mental health outcomes related to those who experience these interactions. Results indicated that individuals experience these messages most often in the form of evaluations, directives, and accusations. Though, a new type of hurtful message, <i>multimodal,<\/i> emerged where participants reported being verbally criticized and offensively touched in the same area. Threats, expressions of desire, jokes, and accusations tended to evoke the most pain. Findings indicated that individuals receive skinny shaming messages most often from friends, non-family adults, acquaintances, extended family, and their parents. No significant associations were found between the most commonly reported sources and perceived hurt of the skinny shaming message. Lastly, those who experienced more hurtful skinny shaming messages reported higher levels of experience anxiety and objectified body consciousness in the form of surveillance and body shaming\n",null,"Abstracts: In 2010, the Dutch Journalism Fund - a government-sponsored agency mandated to support the press in The Netherlands - switched focus, after many years of discussions and lobbying with both the news industry and parliament. Before, the Fund would support publishers in maintaining their print publications with various subsidies. Afterward, significant financial resources were redirected to inspire innovation across the journalism landscape, including supporting fledgling news organizations online. This in turn boosted the rapid development of startups, and in a few years over 70 of such new journalism ventures were founded and (partly) funded. This presentation compares the influence and impact of policy with The Netherlands as a case study, in comparison with news startups developments elsewhere in Europe as part of the 12-country ‘Beyond Journalism’ research project.\n","Abstract Body: Why do some individuals consume a lot of news, while others consume very little? Why do some people seek out partisan news, while others turn to legacy news sources? This study seeks to explain different patterns of news exposure through a typology of four distinct news media orientations. A reworked version of the Gamson Hypothesis (1968, 1971) is applied to the field of journalism to argue that the combination of two perceptions—news media trust and news media self-efficacy—will explain different patterns of news exposure. A national survey of U.S. adults, fielded in January of 2019, is used to test this argument. Results indicate that the four orientations correspond to different socio-demographics, patterns of news consumption, and overall levels of news intake. We discuss the merits of the Gamson Hypothesis (for news) as a framework for understanding thedemocratic implications of the current high-choice media age.\n","Abstract Body: As news organizations navigate a period of uncertainty, many are increasing their efforts to improve their relationship with their audiences. he result is a growing emphasis within journalism and journalism research on \"\"audience engagement,\"\" a loosely defined term that comprises efforts by journalists to more explicitly communicate and collaborate with their audiences. This study builds on research focused on audience engagement by examining news workers' perceptions regarding audience engagement in a local newspaper chain and their organization's attempts at strengthening their relationship with audiences. By breaking down how journalists perceive their efforts at audience engagement into specific functions, this study reveals what audience engagement and community strengthening strategies news workers think of as more successful over others and uses the theoretical lens of new institutional theory to explain the findings.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Why do some individuals consume a lot of news, while others consume very little?

Based on interviews with 22 editors and journalists from 13 publications in Singapore, this study finds three interesting trends: First, news organizations in Singapore follow closely how web analytics is used in newsrooms in the West and have embraced it but are cautious and selective towards data-driven journalism, especially when it touches on sensitive issues like politics, race, and religion. Second, conceptualizations of web analytics use in earlier research conducted in the Western context is less significant in Singapore where its use accentuates a triangle of tension between three forces: the social system, editorial autonomy and market values. Third, the dumbing down of news linked to web analytics in the West becomes more complex, with newsrooms finding it “safer” to respond to web analytics by dabbling with soft news, memes, the tragic and the comic as they assign utopian and dystopian values to web analytics through the lens of the social system.\n","Abstract Body: This article proposes a typology for the ways that journalists respond to their policy environments in contexts of semi-authoritarianism. Using ethnographic data collected over seven months of participant observation and interviews in East Africa, the study applies concepts from field theory and neoinstitutional theory to propose that, depending on the level of conformation or division within the political system and the primary funding model of the journalism field, journalists within a field tend to choose one of three types of response. These responses range from the most passive — cooperation, exemplified by most Rwandan journalists; to the most active — exploitation, exemplified by most Ugandan journalists. Tanzanian journalists generally fall in between these two responses with a critical approach that involves verbal criticism while generally abiding by media policy. This study illuminates the range of agency available to journalists operating within strong, centralized political systems and, in so doing, highlights ways that media policy has direct and indirect effects on national journalism fields and individual journalists.\n","Abstract Body: <br />The Lebanese media sector has played a pioneering role in the Arab world due to its free and diverse system.

The question of how to balance the public’s right to free speech with the negative implications of extremist content has always been a difficult one to reckon with. However, it has grown even more pressing at a moment when extremist content, and the websites that host it, have become implicated in acts of violence and terror across the globe, spurring increased calls for regulation of these platforms.<br /> <br />For instance, the creator of the web forum 8chan called for it to be shut down in August 2019 after shootings in California, Texas, and New Zealand were declared on the site before they happened (Roose, 2019a). In response to a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, where more than 20 people were killed, the internet infrastructure company Cloudflare took the site offline (Roose, 2019b). Though Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince eventually decided to stop supporting 8chan, he also told the <i>New York Times<\/i> that he was concerned pushing it into harder-to-reach corners of the internet would make extremists’ activities more difficult for law enforcement to monitor (Roose, 2019b). Prince then relayed a “slippery slope” argument: If Cloudflare deplatforms 8chan, how would the company distinguish other sites that might be acceptable in the U.S. but disfavored elsewhere, like a site promoting a gay rights organization operating inside a country where such an identity is prohibited (Roose, 2019b)?<br /> <br />Prince’s ambivalence about 8chan speaks to a larger question of how best to approach the regulation of extremist content online. It also speaks to a set of assumptions about the audience for extremist content: that it comprises a similarly extreme, homogenous group of people who are unlikely to seek out news from more mainstream sources. Yet despite the fact that many are concerned about the audiences for extremist sites, few empirical studies have explored who these audiences actually comprise, and how these audiences actually behave.<br /> <br />This study will explore these questions. It will draw on data from the online analytics firm Comscore to examine the audience composition and behavior of three extremist websites: 8chan, Stormfront, and Infowars. These sites were chosen because 8chan and Stormfront publish racist, hateful language, while Infowars publishes conspiracy theories. These sites also tend to play central roles in discussions of how extreme language on the internet should – or should not – be regulated. We will compare the audiences for these sites against the audience composition and behavior of news websites such as the <i>New York Times<\/i>, the <i>Washington Post<\/i>, and Fox News Politics. Comscore data has been used in the past to analyze digital audiences (Nelson & Taneja, 2018; Nelson & Webster, 2016).<br /> <br /><i>Literature Review<\/i><br /> <br />In an attempt to understand the psychology and functioning of extremist groups online, scholars have examined how extremists communicate (Bliuc, Faulkner, Jakubowicz, & McGarty, 2018) and the networks they create (Burris, Smith, & Strahm, 2000). For instance, Gerstenfeld, Grant, and Chiang determined through a content analysis that extremist sites give hate groups the opportunity to control their own images and “allows them to share materials and members with little regard for geographic, linguistic, or other barriers” (2003, p. 42). Interviews with users of Stormfront, a long-running white supremacist site, uncovered that some of them feel a sense of community and safety in that virtual space (De Koster & Houtman, 2008). Glaser, Dixit, and Green interacted with white supremacist chat room users to rank scenarios, such as interracial marriage, racially integrated neighborhoods, and competition for jobs, that the users found the most threatening (2002).<br /> <br />Brown analyzed white supremacists’ framing of people of African descent and concluded that “critical attention to White supremacist discourse, on the internet and elsewhere, may not only provide attention to hate groups, but also may help uncover social norms that validate Whiteness in society” (2009, p. 205). Similarly, Adams and Roscigno’s framing study of white supremacist discourse determined that while the “relative anonymity” of the internet gives white supremacist groups new avenues for recruitment, it may also offer social movement scholars new opportunities “for extracting and assessing the components” of white supremacist, and other, subcultures (2005, p. 775). What is missing from these analyses is a comprehensive look at the audience composition and behavior of extremist sites.<br /> <br /><i>Findings and Conclusion<\/i><br /> <br />Our study fills this gap. Our initial findings reveal that the audiences for extremist sites tend to be far more heterogeneous than many suspect. In August 2019, more than 55% of the unique visitors to Stormfront, the white supremacist site, self-identified as “somewhat liberal” or “very liberal” in their political outlook. These findings suggest that a significant portion of Stormfront’s traffic consists of curious users who want to see what the site contains but do support the content. Furthermore, preliminary findings also indicate extremist website audiences consume news media from more mainstream news as well. Finally, we find evidence that visitors to these extremist sites are much more deliberate about finding this content than news consumers of more mainstream sites.<br /> <br />We will conclude by discussing how our findings could be used as an argument against regulating the distribution of extremist content, since it seems as though the people who expose themselves to these sites are willing to go out of their way to find it. Instead, in light of the fact that audiences of extremist sites also consume news from mainstream sites, perhaps stakeholders should pursue means to make the content within those mainstream sites more effective at dissuading their users from also venturing out to extremist sites as well.\n","Abstract Body: Concerns about shrinking audiences for news have inspired a growing number of studies that examine why people say they avoid news and how they navigate the world without it (e.g., Edgerly, 2017; Newman et al., 2019; Toff & Nielsen, 2018; Woodstock, 2014). But since news avoiders make many of the same complaints about news as news consumers do, the question of why some people sustain a news habit while others actively avoid news remains largely unanswered. This in-progress study draws on a mix of both qualitative and quantitative approaches to advance and test new theory about the role played by individual personality differences in shaping whether or not people maintain a regular news habit. If personality characteristics do in fact predict amounts of news consumption to a significant degree—even if conditional on other factors—these results have important implications for how news organizations might seek to expand and/or retain their subscriber bases. Different messages—if not different modes of news altogether—are likely to appeal to different segments of the public.\n","Abstract Body: A growing number of citizens actively avoid being exposed to legacy news media. In research, a number of contextual factors are discussed as reasons for this increase in avoidance, such as increasing negativity, polarization, and emotionalization of our information environments (Van Aelst et al., 2017). This research project aims to find out, to what extent news avoidance can be explained through the psychological concept of being ‘high sensitivity’. Highly sensitive persons process information more deeply than others, and are more strongly impacted by the emotions of others. We argue that they are thus affected more strongly by negative and emotional new coverage as well. We tested whether highly sensitive citizens are more likely to avoid legacy news media, by examining the relationship between media use and sensory-processing sensitivity among a representative sample of Austrian citizens.\n","Abstract Body: Despite conventional wisdom that maintains that images hold power to affect change, pervasive academic debate exists as to the extent of the actual influence that news images possess to create outcomes. And with more than 1 trillion photos taken each year, it is difficult for any single photo to capture our attention. But from time to time, select images of horrific mass suffering have shaken us temporarily and led to some immediate action. Through experimental research, this study seeks to explore how indicators of image virality (e.g., the number of shares, social engagements) modify perceptions of an image and one’s proclivity to take action against the atrocity.\n","Abstract Body: What is news (or what it is not) is a question that has been asked time without number in the past, particularly in the Global North. Harcup and O'Neill, (2017: 1470) contend that “the deceptively simple question “what is news?” remains pertinent even ponder the future of journalism”. McQuail(2000:337) notes that the question of what is news? Is problematic; ‘journalists themselves seem to find distinctly metaphysical and difficult to answer except in terms of their institutions, ‘feel’ and ‘innate judgment’.These questions, among many others, asked in the past, calls attention to the simple yet complex and elusive definition of news. Inadvertently, these questions and the responses elicited have obscured rather than reveal the description of news, particularly from a user(s) perspective. The framing of these questions seems to be aimed at journalists, thus reproducing a passive gaze of the audience, while painting an image of stable journalism practice.<br /> <br />Nonetheless, the above questions are relevant in the increasingly networked mediascape for two main reasons: first, the question has received little (if any) grounded empirical and theoretical responses in the global south. Secondly, the increasing focus of news as an object of journalism has obfuscated rather than reveal the daily consumption patterns and uses of news among African users, despite the calls for urgent research on ‘media audiences and users’ (Willems and Mano, 2016). Put differently, news has often been approached as an object of journalism, with very little efforts expended to delineate it from emerging forms of ‘citizen journalism’ (Deuze, 2019).<br /> <br /><br /><br />News consumption has received considerable attention in Europe and America. Notably, two research bodies: The Pew Research Centre (Brenner, 2013; Gottfried & Shearer, 2016; Purcell, Rainie, Mitchell, Rosenstiel, & Olmstead, 2010; Purcell, Rainie, Rosenstiel, & Mitchell, 2011) in the USA, and the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford University ( see Newman, Fletcher, Kalogeropoulos, Levy, & Nielsen, 2017; Newman, Levy, & Nielsen, 2015); have consistently monitored and mapped news consumption providing incredible insights on the emerging trends and patterns in the global north comparatively to the global south. Young people's news consumption patterns, Antunovic et al., (2016) established, revolves around routine surveillance needs gratified directly or incidentally through a wide range of online platforms. News is conceptualized in this case as ‘not just mediating reality but actually constructing experience and acquiring identity’(McQuail, 2000:337). The increasingly networked Kenyan mediascape, arguably, have altered ‘roles, relationships and human group identities’(Hepp, 2011:14). However, news as the object of consumption has not received much attention.<br /><br />Thus by focusing on ‘news’ content, this study not focuses on news as content disseminated via a multiplicity of platforms but also positions social media and messaging applications as symbolic news content by themselves due to their embedded socio-technical affordances. Important to note, these affordances keep changing and mutating as technologies evolve. For example, in the twilight years of Facebook and Twitter, (Boyd & Ellison, 2007) identified four affordances, namely: persistence, visibility, spreadability, and searchability (10). However, Miller et al., (2016:10) argue that platforms such as WhatsApp (founded in 2009), Instagram (founded 2010) and Snapchat (founded 2011) among others don’t necessarily exhibit such affordances, instead they ‘do consolidate a trend towards scalable sociality’. Social media have challenged the mundane understanding of ‘sociability, audience activity, passivity and involvement’(Papacharissi & Mendelson, 2010:212).<br /><br /><br />For Park (1940) news is bits of information about social events, which offers people the way of knowing the world. This view is consistent with Tuchman's (1978) suggestion that the explanation of news events provides a much-needed context for consumers’ debates. McQuail (2010) further adds that news is not something complete and fully formed-it is constructed like any other form of communication (110). In the same fashion, Clark and Marchi (2017:21) view “news” as a form of story-based communication (21), with social media playing an increasingly important role in how news is defined”(4). While for Fletcher and Park (2017) news is a lens through which people view society. Embedded in these descriptions of news is the unsettling view of news as a useful tool in making sense of immediate surroundings and keeping touch with the ‘outside world’. Thus, “news consumption is the key pillar of civic life” (Elvestad, Phillips, and Feuerstein 2017:3), leading to an informed electorate (Jarvis, Stroud, & Gilliland, 2009), who then actively participate in their civic and political duties (Elvestad & Phillips, 2018; Westlund, 2015). However, the continued focus on news as a pillar in entrenching and sustaining liberal democracy in the Global North has obscured context-based realities, particularly in Global South. Yet scholars and media practitioners seem to have allowed this form of broad-brush generalization of what news is(or what it is not), of course, based on the assumption that what the understanding of news and its value in a society is universal and can be applied across contexts. The result is “an idea of democracy hardly informed by popular articulations of personhood and agency in Africa”(Nyamnjoh, 2005:282)<br />They afford users spaces where they acquire, produce, and negotiate meanings. Rather than offering a uniform experience in Africa, different social media platforms are used to access different types of information and facilitate different types of interactions and sociability among users. Swart et al. (2019:3) contend, “news has more than just an informational function and can also foster sociability”. Yet despite the widespread agreement on digital disruptions, partly triggered by the adoption and adaptation of these platforms, the contents carried or affected by these waves of disruptions have not received much attention in Africa. Particularly at a time when studies conducted in the Global North show that young people's news consumption is increasingly ‘gravitating towards online sources of news and information’(Antunovic et al., 2016).<br /><br />The reason for giving news such a high profile in media studies is that it is the prime source of information about the world (McQuail, 2000), and its various domains as argued by Couldry and Hepp(2016). News merits special attention in a discussion of media content-including social media and messaging applications- just because it is one of the few original contributions of the mass media to the range of cultural forms of expressions (McQuail, 2000:337). News, and media platforms, have often played an incredible role in (re)mediating the lived experiences of the audience and users in context. Through framing, news has often played a critical role in shaping public discourses. Kellner(1995b:3), argues ‘society and culture are organized by media culture’. Media institutions, McQuail (2000:337) observes, “could barely exist without news, and news could not exist without media”. Yet even with the clarity of purpose on why the discussion of news is important, its definition remains quite elusive to date. In the global south, news has often been ‘constructed’ in a way that produces and re-produces the interests of the ruling elites, institutions and development initiatives.<br /><br />Against this background, this study locates and positions news as a key pillar in linking the wider societal goals and aspirations with individual and collective information needs; mapping how such information shapes, distort, create and recreate realities in context. Often, young people have been perceived as ‘makers’ or ‘breakers’ in Africa, predominantly being portrayed as ‘breakers’“feared for the disorder their number and ideological choices might engender”(de Bruijn & Both, 2017: 781). In part, these ideological choices, are informed by the “content’(including news) propagated and mediated by the media resulting in what Herman and Chomsky (1988) described as “the manufacturing of consent”.<br />This article is drawn from a larger study conducted at the Technical University of Kenya (Tu-K) and the University of Eldoret (UoE) Kenya from November 2017 to July 2018. Universities as spaces of studying embody the social and structural place where young people spend most of their time with comrades and university employees (Such as lecturers, administrators, among other staff). With this in mind, this study sought to specifically explore how young people understood the news and possibly draw a nexus between the rise of news technologies as well as social networking sites in understanding news. From the 400 respondents, systematic random sampling was conducted to arrive at a maximum of seven participants in each year of study(1<sup>st<\/sup>-4<sup>th<\/sup> year), making the total number of participants 56. This gave me a total of eight focus groups. Besides, a further two (male and female) participants from each focus group were sampled to participate in online observation, a form of ethnographic data collection. appropriate’ Miller et al., (2016) argue that‘Participant observation is learning about what behavior is considered (31). I sought permission from these participants to follow them on facebook and twitter, to enable me to monitor their posts and possibly draw insights on what such posts were useful in defining and redefining what news is from their perspective.<br /><br />Findings support the conclusion that the conventional understanding of news has profoundly been altered by the rapid innovations, particularly the high mobile devices and internet penetration rates among young people (smartphones, tablets, phablets, smartwatches, and smart glasses among others). While new technologies mediate the social world, news as content shapes the construction of the social world in varied ways, and at the same time complicating the existing social relationships within the same world. These tensions and contradictions played out in the gradations of sub-domains, namely: local, regional, national and global domains of news consumption. While this demonstrates and resonates with the concept of scalable sociality, it is worth mentioning that this kind of differentiation can occur simultaneously in any given news engagement moment. Apart from the geographical differentiation of the social world and its subdomains increasingly featured in the understanding of the news as a window to the social world.<br /><br /><br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: In recent years, solutions journalism has received increasing interest — from both practicing journalists and researchers – as the genre aims to balance out the prevailing news negativity. Several studies have found that solutions-oriented stories impact the audience differently than traditional problem-centric stories. This study examines whether data visualizations that highlight the effectiveness of the solutions, a key element of solutions journalism, have an impact on the perception of the story. A controlled experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 706) has been conducted to compare seven different story versions: a non-solutions story, a solutions story with textual evidence and five solution stories with an additional visualization: a table, a doughnut chart, a bar chart, a pictorial chart, and an infographic. Findings indeed indicated that readers of a solutions story had an increase in positive affect, more positive attitudes toward the story, and the proposed solution as well as a higher perceived knowledge gain in comparison to those who read the non-solutions story. Analyses also showed that results are consistent across gender and party identification. Except for the evaluation of journalistic standards, which yielded somewhat better results for the table, the doughnut chart, and the pictorial chart, no differences in effect were found among solutions stories with and without visualizations. These findings are discussed in light of the increasing popularity of solutions journalism in both journalistic practice and scientific research. Potentials are seen in solutions journalism strengthening the trust in the news media and fostering civic engagement.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Current literature examining journalism’s boundary work has focused mostly on traditional, hard news journalism, while soft news journalism, such as lifestyle journalism, has largely been overlooked. Guided by the framework of boundary work, this paper examines how traditional fashion journalists and fashion bloggers define their own professionalism and what that says about the negotiation of fashion journalism’s boundaries. Through a textual analysis of the ‘About’ pages of 40 mainstream fashion magazine websites and fashion blogs, this paper shows that fashion magazines and fashion blogs demonstrate differences in the four areas of mode of presentation, rituals of asserting authority, operation mechanism, and relationship with the audience. For each theme, fashion magazine websites and fashion blogs display different approaches that help to shape their professional identities. These four areas serve as markers of the emerging – and perhaps blurring – boundaries between the two media actors.\n","Abstract Body: Previous research has revealed a connection between news consumption and class, both in terms of how much and what kind of news is consumed. By deploying a cultural sociological perspective on how young people from different class positions make sense of their differences, this study breaks new ground in the study of news use and inequality. Focus group interviews with young working-class and middle-class people show how social groups mobilize differences in news consumption to draw symbolic boundaries between each other. The moral economy surrounding “productive” or “unproductive” approaches towards news and journalism is a venue that allows social groups to construct an <i>other<\/i>, over whom a sense of social, cultural, and moral superiority can be maintained. The study takes the understanding of news consumption inequalities beyond the standard concern with gaps in knowledge and participation by locating news consumption inequalities in relation to symbolic struggles between social groups.\n","Abstract Body: State-funded international broadcasters play a significant role in international diplomacy. This article explores how journalists working at these organisations understand and rationalise their role as diplomatic actors. Specifically, how do they navigate the clash  between their desire for profesional journalistic autonomy,  and the restrictions imposted by some state funded outlets on journalistic freedom? We present the findings of 52 research interviews with  journalists working for international news organizations funded by the Chinese, US, UK and Qatari governments. Despite  considerable cultural and orgnisational differences between the outlets  in our  study, we  found that journalists utilised common narratives to justify and rationalise  their work. We call these  ‘legimitimising narratives’ and argue that they are a key feature of journalists’ professional identity and boundary work.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <i>This study investigates the visual boundaries that are used to either disclose the commercial nature of native advertising or to mimic the articles of a news outlet. This has potential implications for journalism regarding transparency, trust, and credibility. Methodologically, this study used content analysis covering 21 publications in five countries: Germany, Israel, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. We analyzed 373 individual native ads. The findings show that news outlets have not reached a consistent way to clearly disclose native ads visually, negotiating the balance between transparency and deception. Most news outlets use several visual elements, which are normally used for their articles to camouflage native ads. At the same time, many news outlets work towards transparency by providing disclosure to varying degrees. As the results differ widely among various types of news organizations, the implementation of native advertising seems to be contingent on the normative understanding of journalism in news organizations.<\/i>\n","Abstract Body: Very few studies have empirically analyzed data-driven journalistic practice through a political lens, exploring differences in political and bureaucratic structures that promote or hinder computational journalism’s growth. This comparative project has two goals in contributing to the literature: 1. to investigate means by which public policies on government transparency and open data impinge on news work in different countries; and 2. to understand how journalists are dealing with public data insufficiencies that point to potential.\n","Abstract Body: Today’s converged media environment has allowed news organizations to engage in practices of multi-platform distribution and dayparting of news output, whereby a single news piece is being offered to the audience multiple times across different platforms throughout the news day (Boczkowski & Ferris, 2005; Erdal, 2009; Hanusch, 2017). However, not every news article goes through this process of cross-media distribution to the same extent and in the same way. The more an article is reproduced across media platforms, the more “visible” it becomes in the total news supply. As argued by Singer (2013), journalists’ control over the visibility of the news they publish is being diluted in the digital news environment, where news users have now become ‘secondary gatekeepers’ who can, through their clicking, liking and sharing behavior, up- or downgrade the visibility of particular news items. However, whereas Singer's (2013) notion of ‘user-generated visibility’ puts emphasis on how users participate in the sharing of news content, users’ engagement with news content also flows back to the newsrooms in the form of audience metrics, where it can directly influence the ‘primary gatekeeping’ process. This study contends that due to the rising importance of audience engagement metrics in the editorial decision-making process, a better understanding is needed of the relationship between news selection and story placement decisions, on the one hand, and user engagement metrics, on the other hand. The central assumption is that ‘news visibility’ correlates with ‘audience engagement’. Through real-time analytics and metrics, systems that measure and collect digital audience data, journalists are now acutely aware of how news consumption patterns differ depending on the time of the day and depending on the platform a story is published on. Journalists might respond to this metrics-instigated boost in visibility and select and package content differently to distribute and tailor it across different dayparts and different platforms (Tandoc, 2019). Little is known so far on the implications of day- and platform-parting for both the visibility of and audience engagement with news stories, whether or not biased in favor of certain article types or topics. <br /> <br />This study therefore seeks to investigate the relationship between cross-media news visibility and user engagement with news: <br /> <br /><i>RQ1: Is there a correlation between cross-media news visibility and audience engagement?  <\/i><br /> <br />To answer this question, we will analyze news stories produced by five Flemish (north-Belgian) news outlets, four of them owned by one of the two major commercial media companies in Flanders (DPG Media and Mediahuis) and the Flemish public service broadcaster VRT, for a period of one month (November 2019). During this month, we will take a snapshot three times per day (at 8 a.m., 2 p.m. and 8 p.m.) of all the news articles that were available on five platforms, namely the outlet’s website homepage, its Facebook page, its Twitter page and the print edition (of the morning newspapers) or the evening newscast of the public service broadcaster. <br />To measure the cross-media visibility of each news story, we count the number of times a story is showcased across the different platforms (print and social media) and the length of showcasing in dayparts on the website homepage. Hence, high visibility would occur when a story is published online and featured on the home page in several consecutive snapshots, shared on all social media platforms and published in print. Minimal visibility would occur when a story is published on the homepage but never featured, shared or published in print.  <br />To measure audience engagement with the news story, we use data analytics provided by the three news organizations that were prepared to give us access to their metrics. As we were granted access to their Google Analytics platform and in-house dashboards, we have a wide range of metrics at our disposal like pageviews, reach, attention time and conversion rates. We supplement the on-site user data with Facebook and Twitter engagement data (number of likes, comments, retweets) for each news story posted on the Facebook and Twitter pages of the five news outlets. All audience engagement metrics will be operationalized in ordinal categories relative to the average engagement of the news platform (for example: below average pageviews, average pageviews, above average pageviews).<br />In addition, we will perform content analysis in a two-step process. First, we will computationally extract information on the news articles that might affect user engagement and cross-media visibility. We record the presence/absence of an image or video and the article length in number of words. We automatically determine the broad thematic of the text using a machine-learned topic classifier and detect mentioned entities and events using named-entity recognition software and a dependency parser for Dutch. These automatic methods allow coding of large quantities of articles in an objective manner as an intermediate step for further quantitative analysis. <br />In a second step, we will manually code news stories on a range of variables, including the story’s hard/soft news nature, article type (e.g. news report, opinion, analysis, interview), news values and the story place (i.e. its position on the website’s homepage or in the print edition). This will allow us to answer our second research question:<br /> <br /><i>RQ2: Which type of news stories are more likely to receive a high cross-media visibility?<\/i><br /> <br />As our study is currently in the stage of data collection, we will most likely be able to present you the first, preliminary results of the computational and manual content analyses at the conference. Specifically, we would appreciate the input of the ICA attendees on both our conceptualization and operationalization of “cross-media news visibility”. We are also seeking input regarding additional features of news (controlled variables) that may be predictive of cross-media news visibility. <br /> <br /> <br />References<br /> <br />Boczkowski, P.

More specifically, this research examines the degree to which content created by local Code for America “brigades” approximates journalism.

From a perspective of framing theory, this study examined the coverage of the Zika virus in English and Spanish-language newspapers in the United States over a 15-month period, from 2015 to 2016. Through a quantitative content analysis, this study examined the major themes, valence, causes, and sources cited in the news stories about ZIKV. The findings revealed that the overall news coverage of ZIKV was infused with two competing themes – panic-fear and action-control. In addition, neutral valence was predominantly employed to balance scientific uncertainty which could trigger alarmism and panic-fear in the emerging stage of the epidemic. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study explores and compares the representation of Saudi women in both American and Saudi newspapers as well as the differences between traditional newspapers and social media (Twitter) in the media coverage of Saudi women regarding the driving ban lift. This study analyzed a total of 682 articles from four newspapers, <i>Al-Jazirah<\/i>, <i>Al-Riyadh<\/i>, <i>The Washington Post<\/i>, and <i>The New York Times<\/i> that covered Saudi women regarding the driving ban lift from September 20, 2017, to June 30, 2018. The findings indicate that the written and visual depictions of Saudi Arabia women driving during the ban lifted were more positive in Saudi Arabia newspapers and the Twitter official accounts of newspapers. The written depictions of American newspapers and the Twitter official accounts of newspapers were framed negatively as usually Western media depicted Muslim women as victims, less power, or less voice. This confirms that Western media still represent Muslims women negatively, even in a positive context. Although both Saudi Arabian and American media depicted Saudi women as passive, the visual depiction of Saudi women driving was more passive than active in Saudi newspapers than in U.S. newspapers. It is also interesting to observe that news media and social media stories run and end approximately at the same time in terms of news cycle. In addition, the domestic or local media in Saudi Arabia broke the news and led the news stories that appeared in U.S. or international media in general, but the stories from each country ended in a similar time.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the relationship between perceived journalism framing and US public’s response towards the coverage of the US-China trade conflict. A national survey of US adult population indicated that more people perceived that the media escalated the conflict between China and the U.S. than promoted peace between the countries.  Perceived peace journalism framing is positively related to perception of China and press performance while perceived war journalism framing is negatively related to press performance but not perception on China.  Perceived war journalism framing is a strong predictor of the public’s support of US trade policy.  Perceived war and peace journalism framing affects the audience’s opinion of press performance more than news media type and amount of media use.  Among media use factors, conservative media use predicts negative perception of China but cross-cutting media use  predicts positive perception of China. Partisan and non-partisan media use, not cross-cutting media use, predicts press performance perception.  Almost half of the respondents saw the coverage as news media’s challenge to the Trump administration and complained of too little coverage of the conflict.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examines media coverage of social protests in Montenegro, where the demand for free media was front and center during the 2019 anti-government protests. Relying on the theoretical framework of the protest paradigm, it explores the extent to which media rely on identified marginalization tools to report on protest and explores pressures on journalistic work. Based on 13 in-depth interviews with editors and journalists, the data shed light on the ways in which the political power struggles are manifested via media messages in a clientelistic and polarized media system in the Balkans. In this specific media system, the most important factor that determines media coverage of protests is the clintelistic ties of the news media with the current government. While the government-controlled news media in Montenegro adopted many facets of the protest paradigm when framing the protests, the oppositional and independent media deviated from it instead offering a very supportive narrative. The nuanced accounts from this analysis emphasize the interplay between the pressures coming from the political linkages of news media and journalists strive for professionalism.\n",null,"Abstract Body: ICA 2020: Journalism Studies Division – Extended abstract<br /><br />Journalists as agenda-setters: How do they perceive their roles with regards to refugee coverage<br /><br />Introduction<br /><br />The theory of agenda-setting dates back to 1972. McCombs and Shaw (1972) coined the term agenda-setting. They said readers or viewers learn about public issues from the news and also learn how much prominence to give certain issues from the amount, and or type, of information in the story. Traditional agenda-setting research measures the media agenda at one time and the public agenda at another time. This study aims to advance the theory of agenda-setting by contributing a qualitative angle to the theory by looking at how journalists perceive their role as agenda-setters in relation to media coverage of refugees in Australia. What, and how, journalists report on certain issues can directly and indirectly affect public opinion and in turn may affect public policies. Therefore, how journalists report about refugees can affect refugees themselves. The UNHCR has urged the media and politicians to be careful in their discussions of refugees. The UN High Commissioner in 2001 said “politicians and the media have a special charge to keep in combating racism, xenophobia and intolerance, and in resisting the temptation to scapegoat refugees” (UNHCR, 2001).<br />This research seeks to understand how journalists and editors perceive their roles as agenda-setters in local/regional news outlets as well as at a national level. Do journalists think the way they report news sets the public or political agenda of issues? Van Aelst et al. (2008) say “journalists rarely admit that they have power, or at least that they use<br />their power deliberately.” This research is especially interested in the agenda-setting role of journalists in relation to refugee and migration news coverage. Past research has looked at journalists’ perceptions of their agenda-setting role in relation to refugee and migration news coverage. Gemi, Ulasiuk, and Triandafyllidou (2013) found 45 out of 68 European journalists in their study about migrants said yes to the question “Does your media outlet produce news stories which go out of the political agenda?” These journalists challenged the often-negative political agenda regarding migrants and reported positive human interest and success stories. Bennett, ter Wal, Lipinski, Fabiszak, and Krzyzanowski (2013) conducted interviews with journalists in six European countries about the representations of migrants in the media. They found “interviewees frequently emphasised the independence of their media outlet from the political agenda and presented themselves as agenda setters” (Bennett et al., 2013, p. 258).<br /><br />Methods<br /><br />Participants in this study were editors and journalists from three different Australian news outlets. All interviews were conducted via telephone or email due to the location of many of these news outlets. The journalists and editors were first asked for general demographic information about their position, who they report to, how long they have worked as a journalist or editor, where else they had worked, and any formal qualifications they had. They were also asked about their views on media coverage of refugees by Australian media. They were asked if they know of, and abide by, the MEAA Journalists’ Code of Ethics, and if they follow Australian Press Council guidelines regarding reporting of minorities. They were also asked if they have had cultural training in the newsroom, how they perceive their role as agenda-setters, if they understand the differences between refugees and asylum seekers, and their news-gathering techniques when interviewing refugees.<br /><br />Findings and discussion<br /><br />Two editors and eight reporters from one national public broadcaster, one national online news outlet and one regional news outlet took part in this research. These include 7 men and 3 women with 4 to 40 years of experience. Among respondents, there was an overwhelming sense that they did not have the power to be agenda-setters. Three journalists thought their organisations (which were all regional news outlets) had the ability to be agenda-setters. For example, the sole journalist who thought he had minor influence said “On a very, very, very minor level. I don't think I have much influence. I think I have... my ability to influence the agenda would be like 0.0001% or something like that.” The regional journalists thought their news outlets had the ability to be agenda-setters. One regional journalist said “Yes. The local newspaper is a powerful voice in the local community and the issues it gives import to are obviously more likely to be seen by readers and therefore talked about.” Another regional journalist said “Our editor makes it quite clear that he wants us to be an agenda setter in town and to try and be not just the first with the news, but to also try and campaign for things and to try and get things to happen in town.” There was a sense among respondents that there were more powerful agenda-setters in the Australian mediascape than themselves. One respondent said “the front pages of the News Corp newspapers, they are huge agenda-setters. I think they have a huge impact on cultural and thinking around Australia, what goes on the front pages of those papers.”<br /><br />When asked who is more powerful in terms of setting the agenda - politicians or journalists - responses were mixed. One respondent simply stated “Well the media would argue it's the politicians and the politicians would argue that it's the media.” An editor from a national news outlet said “We need to be blind to the political agenda. We need to have an agenda that's based on what we think the people of Australia need to know about what's going on.” Another editor stated “Look, there are so many sources of agenda, bouncing around these days, from mainstream media to Twitter that I don't think anybody can seriously claim to be setting anything, maybe contributing to discussion or debate is about as bold as we can be on that front.” Generally, many respondents expressed that the public drove what was on the agenda. One journalist said “I do think the media reflects a lot of the issues that the public are interested in. I don't think they go rogue on their own and set their own agenda completely irrelevant of what the public is interested in.” Another reporter added “I think journalists have an occasionally unhealthy tendency to think of themselves as agenda setters when in fact they are following the readers’ interests. We produce stories that matter to our readers. Consumerist might be the best way to describe our approach.”<br /><br />In terms of reporting on refugees, some respondents saw themselves as going against the political agenda of the government. One journalist said her organisation reported against the government’s wishes in relation to the Medevac Bill, “the Medevac Bill is a classic example of that. The media were pretty strong in reporting that and covering it. Whereas at times our leaders did just want to shut down that conversation and not go down that path.” Another journalist said “I think [my organisation] does a very good job covering scenarios going on on Nauru and that's exactly the opposite of what the government wants. It's basically a media blackout over there.” A regional journalist said “We write tens of stories a day. Often the best stories are the issues that the government isn’t giving attention to.” Another regional journalist also said “We do talk about refugees a lot here and we do talk about homelessness a lot. And we do talk about those kinds of issues quite a lot here. That's not something that our local politicians are often speaking about, but we are.”<br /><br />The results of this study are a unique insight into journalists’ perceived roles as agenda-setters when it comes to reporting on refugees. Initial results show journalists at regional outlets perceive their ability to be agenda-setters as more powerful than those at national news outlets. Most journalists and editors still believe their agendas are driven by what their audience wants and not by any internal or external factors. This work in progress paper welcomes feedback from conference attendees and organisers to advance the field of agenda-setting in a qualitative and Australian context.<br /><br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: According to the comparative study of journalistic education on six continents, it “has become one of the fastest growing academic fields in the world” [2, p. 254]. For example, in India, there are about 700 universities with media training programs. In the United States, commercial foundations pay millions dollars for developing the concept of journalistic education in the XXI century. In Brazil, the number of journalism schools is close to 400, and the demand for undergraduate bachelor's programs has attracted fairly high levels of enrollment in the last three decades [7, p. 263].<br />In qualitative terms, there is a rivalry between the two trends. Clearly expressed trend towards unification coexists with national differences in approaches to journalism as a profession and university education. American observers note that this country “not only pioneered journalism education but also news journalism ... journalism as we define it today is an Anglo-American invention. Journalism in continental Europe was closely linked with the literary field which demanded a different set of talents and writing skills from those of a daily rounds reporter” [4, p. 44]. The researchers of journalistic education underline uselessness of copying uniform model; on the contrary, it will be interesting to watch how new, indigenously written materials will differ from the West [2, p. 436]. This view correlates with increasing calling to fix Western bias in journalism studies [3].<br />In this light, it seems appropriate to carry out a special research project focused on national schools of journalism. We are primarily interested in the situation in Russia, although this topic is no less important for other countries. The symptomatic name was given to the CEECOM (Consortium of Central and Eastern Europe in communications and media) conference in 2017 – \"\"Critique of/at/on periphery?\"\". The discussion was aimed at critical analysis of the center-periphery relations between the leading Western countries and the CEE region in journalism and media theory [10].<br />The \"\"Scientific and pedagogical schools of journalism in Russia\"\" project was launched at St. Petersburg University in 2019. For theoretical basis, the cultural and civilizational approach to the phenomena of intellectual and creative activity [9] was chosen; in our case, it emphasizes the national and cultural factors of formation and development of journalism education and denies unification by borrowed patterns, although unconditionally welcomes international exchange of knowledge and experience. The main purpose of the project consists in a comprehensive study of the current state and future prospects of journalism schools in Russia, which have cultural and civilizational nature and specificity. The project program includes a set of special objectives: a) to identify in schools original qualitative characteristics and achievements, which can be considered as national priorities and advantages; b) to develop and use methods of qualitative and quantitative analysis and typological modeling of pedagogic practicing; c) to create a series of professional portraits of the schools eminent representatives, at metropolitan and regional universities; g) to define the development trends in this field of educational activities.<br />The advanced system of journalistic education in Russia deserves to become an object of in-depth studying. First, scientific and pedagogical activities in the field of journalism are intensive and diverse: media professionals are being trained at more than 150 universities; accordingly, there is a developed organizational environment for the formation of educational schools. Secondly, journalistic education in unity with a theory has its official history since the early 1920s (the State Institute of Journalism under the leadership of K.P. Novitsky), and large and authoritative centers have been formed, reasonably claiming to be the schools with their own theoretical and pedagogical traditions [5]. Thirdly, there are strong grounds to call them namely scientific and pedagogical schools, in the inseparable unity of the two properties. In many countries, theoretical researches are practically separated from teaching as they are concentrated in autonomous scientific institutions, while teaching has more applied nature. As some researchers testify: “The field of Journalism and Mass Communication in the United States has struggled with the proper credentials for its faculty. Many leading educators have argued that … the field should hire faculty without a doctorate in the field. Rather, in this view, the faculty should come from the industry” [1<i>,<\/i> p. 200]. Another famous American author writes in a similar context: “Because journalists lack their own ‘science,’ they tend to assimilate to the nearest available professional science”. [8, p. 200]. On the contrary, Russian researchers argue that the successful development of education is possible only on the basis of principles deeply elaborated in the journalism theory [6]. The interdependence of journalism theory and pedagogy corresponds to the Open Science conceptualization.<br />However, the basic concept of the scientific and pedagogic journalism school has not gained in-depth interpretation; in fact, it is the first time introduced into the subject area of studies. Accordingly, there were no precedents of identifying the state and development prospects of such schools in Russia. The available publications are mostly review and fragmentary, and the authors describe routine teaching and methodical issues. The project in progress will significantly complement the existing research experience. The study has a scientific novelty in terms of setting and solving the stated problems. The set of tasks has no similarity, as well as methodological providing of the project. In particular, for studying journalism schools, such tools were not applied earlier as the historical-biographical method, classification and typological models of schools, comparative methods, etc. Experience in creating a portrait gallery of schools leaders in Russia is also undertaken for the first time. Among the expected results, there are also effects that are directly extrapolated to the university labor process. The latter include developing recommendations for optimization of research activities in the field of journalism and journalism education, arranging a project website with regular information on the progress of works, including portraits of outstanding teachers, upgrading curricula, etc. The project involves colleagues from other Russian and foreign universities; it should contribute to the further widening of international cooperation in journalism education. Perhaps, it will get new impulses within the ICA conference.<br />References<br />Becker, L. B., Vlad, T.

Some aspects of the paradigm have been found in media coverage around the world (Boyle et al., 2012; Harlow, 2019; Kilgo et al., 2018). Yet, recent research problematizes the paradigm, suggesting the relationship between the media and protesters might not be as automatically inimical as previously thought. Adherence to the paradigm depends on a country’s political system, the media outlet’s ideology, and whether the protest coverage is published in traditional media or online (Cottle, 2008; Harlow et al., 2017; Shahin et al., 2016).<br />Shahin et al. (2016) classified international protest coverage into three categories: transnational (examining one country’s media coverage of another country’s protests), comparative (the study of a protest in foreign and domestic media), and ideographic (studying a local protest in local media). Most protest paradigm studies tend to be ideographic or rely exclusively on content analyses. To overcome these weaknesses, this current study operates at an ideographic and comparative level, and employs content analysis and interviews with journalists, to explore how the paradigm functions beyond the United States. Specifically, we compare Southeast Europe (Montenegro and Serbia) and Central America (Guatemala and El Salvador) to allow for meaningful theory building that identifies the conditions under which journalistic protest coverage adheres to the paradigm in different media and political systems. All four countries are developing democracies with histories of armed conflicts and a tradition of media clientelism, media concentration, and limited press freedom. We examine “normative ideas (what journalists <i>should do<\/i>), cognitive orientations (what they <i>want to do<\/i>), professional practice (what journalists <i>really do<\/i>), and narrated performance (what they <i>say they do<\/i>)” (Hanitzsch & Vos, 2017, p.118) in relation to protest coverage. This study makes an important contribution to extant journalism research by identifying a gap between journalists’ role perceptions and enactments, and demonstrating how this gap operates at intra- and cross-national levels.<br />Media clientelism and journalistic roles<br />Media clientelism is defined as a form of political and social organization in which media serve as clients in inferior power relationships with their powerful patrons (Hallin & Mancini, 2004; Hallin & Papathanassopoulos, 2002). Such quid-pro-quo relationships often serve the interests of political and economic elites, rather than those of ordinary citizens (Fox & Waisbord, 2002). Post-communist societies of Southeast Europe developed media clientelist systems due to their inability to build sustainable commercialized enterprises and their turn to powerful political and economic elites for financial support (Roudakova, 2008). Similarly, decades of authoritarian and military rule in Latin America fostered media controlled by private interests with political ties (Guerrero & Márquez-Ramírez, 2014). However, different from Hallin and Mancini’s description of media clientelism as stable, long-term relationships that produce predictable outcomes, contemporary media clientelist ties in Eastern Europe and Latin America are volatile and non-binding, dependent on power shifts and economic support (Guerrero & Márquez-Ramírez, 2014; Ornebring, 2012; Roudakova, 2008; Waisbord, 2013).<br />While research increasingly demonstrates that role perceptions and journalistic cultures do not fit easily into ideal types (Hallin & Mancini, 2017), in Eastern Europe, journalists generally perceive their role as facilitators of democracy (Andersen, Hoxha & Godole, 2017). Regional studies show Latin America tends toward hybridized journalistic cultures, with journalists generally favoring disseminator roles, followed by watchdog and loyal-facilitator roles (Mellado et al., 2017).<br />Against this backdrop, using the protest paradigm and media clientelism as an analytical lens, we pose the following research questions:<br />RQ1) What are the similarities and differences in the <i>normative ideas<\/i> of journalists in a) Montenegro, b) Serbia, c) El Salvador, and d) Guatemala when it comes to protest coverage?<br />RQ2) What are the similarities and differences in the <i>cognitive orientations<\/i> of journalists in these four countries when it comes to protest coverage?<br />RQ3) What are the similarities and differences between the <i>professional practices<\/i> and <i>narrated performances<\/i> of journalists in these four countries when it comes to protest coverage?<br />Methods and analytical approach<br />This study uses semi-structured, in-depth interviews with journalists (conducted from 2018-2019) coupled with content analysis of protest news to explore perceptions and practices of protest reporting. We aim to include 30 interviews with journalists who covered the 2018 social protests in Montenegro and Serbia, as well as 15 interviews with Guatemalan journalists who covered the 2015 anti-government protests, and 15 interviews with Salvadoran journalists who covered various national protests. Our sample will include reporters and editors from diverse backgrounds and news organizations, including traditional outlets and online-native news sites, with a mix of ownership (public and private) and political affiliations. The content analysis will focus on protest news stories generated by the media outlets included in the interviews, and will examine paradigmatic coverage (frames and sourcing) as well as the manifestation of journalistic roles (adapted from Mellado & Van Dalen, 2014). Journalists’ role perceptions during their protest reporting will be compared with their role enactment.<br />Preliminary findings<br />Interview data from Europe support the persistence of the advocacy role in countries with clientelist media systems, and discredit the systematic applicability of the protest paradigm in the case of polarized media systems. Similarly, Guatemalan journalists saw their democratic role as to support the protests. In contrast, Salvadoran journalists saw themselves as passive disseminators. In both Central American countries, however, role perceptions and ideas about normative protest coverage varied depending on topic of protest, pointing to continued influence of clientelist relationships.<br />This study preliminarily indicates that a crucial factor determining paradigm adherence is clientelist ties between news media and political and economic elites. Some journalists openly admitted to positively covering protest movements they identify with, while others used protest marginalization devices - emphasis on conflict and reliance on official sources - to maintain objectivity in their battle with pressures from the media management. Ultimately, we contribute to protest paradigm and journalistic culture scholarship by showing how roles and protest coverage operate at intra- and cross-national levels.<br /><br /><br />References<br />Andersen, K., Hoxha, A., & Godole, J.

Journalists have to negotiate carefully between (over-)exposure and neglect or, more rarely, simply treating populism as “normal” politics. In order to nuance contemporary discussions of such issues, this paper investigates the coverage of the emergence of a populist and xenophobic party, The Danish Folk Party, which entered parliament in 1973 in what has become known as the “landslide” election. As Danish newspapers historically are related to the structure of party politics, the new party necessitated the Danish national dailies to negotiate fully between legitimizing new political claims and defending the established structure of politics (historically founded upon socio-economic differences). By investigating how the discursive negotiations of populist claims revealed a challenge to political parallelism and exposed various positions on the societal roles of journalism, this paper hopes to put into perspective more recent journalistic constructions of populism.\n","Abstracts: Donald Trump’s constant berating of journalists is not a sideshow but indispensable to populist rhetoric that situates the news media—condensed to simply “the media”—as an established elite institution detached from (and therefore hostile toward) the experiences of everyday Americans. Delegitimizing journalism lies at the heart of Trump’s campaign tactics and governing strategy. But such attacks have opened room for journalists to engage in their own variety of normative-infused umbrage as a type of pro-journalism performance. For these journalists, engaging in principled stands against Trump defends against an onslaught of antagonism and supports claims to authority, but also results in a more shallow, reactive discourse rather than a self-reflexive one that probes the role journalists have played in the proliferation of populist politics in the US.\n","Abstracts: What if the populist right is right in their media criticism? Starting from this question, the present paper examines media criticism from the populist right and explores how such attacks are met by professional news organizations. Previous studies have demonstrated that media criticism from the far right is multifaceted, attacking from multiple positions of authority, blurring the boundaries between what is perceived as legitimate criticism or illegitimate conspiracies (Figenschou & Ihlebæk, 2019). If and how to meet populist media critique represent a constant dilemma for contemporary news organizations, as some criticism represent traditional concern about media bias and malpractice, whereas other parts are strategic attempts to undermine journalism as an independent, democratic institution. Stressing the need to unpack populist criticism and take increasing mistrust seriously, this paper explores how journalists interpret and meet such critique in a Nordic context characterized by strong institutional autonomy and an emerging far-right media scene.\n","Abstract Body: The question of how news media should respond to the populist surge is very complex. This is in part because established news institutions can hardly be considered neutral players as they frequently find themselves at the centre of populist attacks. Unsurprisingly, either in an act of self-defence or in defence of democracy more generally, mainstream media’s response to populism is very critical (Wettstein, Esser et al. 2018). As much as one might consider it journalism’s job to deconstruct ideologies that are potentially harmful for democracies, it is important to consider the audience perspective as well. This presentation will summarize survey findings that illustrate that citizen supporters of populism are following mainstream news despite holding strong hostile attitudes toward them. This segment of the audience might hence take any negative evaluation of populist politics as evidence for the populist claim that mainstream news are lying and working against the people’s interest.\n","Abstracts: How are political leaders and civil society responding to populist attacks on the media? This paper examines what is arguably the biggest, most coordinated attempt by political leaders to take action against attacks on journalists and journalism - The Media Freedom Coalition, an initiative spearheaded by the UK and Canadian governments. The group organised a major meeting of international politicians, civil society groups and journalists in London in July 2019; and it is now leading a global pledge and legal fund to prevent attacks on journalistic freedom. This paper draws on interviews with senior civil servants in the UK foreign office, as well as media freedom organisations and NGOs to assess what the coalition is trying to achieve, and how it positions itself in relation to populist leaders like President Trump who seek to undermine journalistic work and credibility.\n","Abstract Body: Social media is widely used by journalists for sourcing and verification. While social media may either serve as supplementary to existing sources or replace traditional channels, it nevertheless poses challenges to the news professionalism. The present study examines the relationship between journalists’ use of social media and other channels for news sourcing and information verification. It also examines how attitudes towards social media may affect the use of social media for sourcing and verification. An online survey of journalists (n = 255) in local news organizations in Hong Kong—a society with a high social media penetration rate and a highly competitive media market—revealed that journalists rely on offline, elite, and ready-made sources (such as information released by public relations companies or governmental officials). Social media both replaces and complements existing channels for sourcing and verification. The perception that social media is a credible source for information was positively related to using social media for news production. The present paper is a modest first study to examine how social media is included in news production in a non-Western context. It offers a better understanding of how new media technologies change the information repertoire during news production in a post-truth era.\n","Abstract Body: Instagram is not often cited as an important tool for journalism, but journalists still use the application in large numbers and so far, there has not been much analysis of how or why. The aim of this paper is to provide a taxonomy of practices journalists use on Instagram.  I argue Instagram is not primarily used as a reporting tool by journalists. Instead, personality and aesthetic focussed practices create a sense of audience engagement and community around the journalist’s professional identity and focus of reportage.  Many of the image and discursive practices journalists use are synonymous with the perceived culture of the platform, as well as the type of journalism being practiced, and the professional boundaries journalists were placing on use of the platform itself. This paper uses a mixed methodology of social media profile analysis and semi structured interviews with Australian journalists to build a taxonomy of journalistic practices on Instagram. The resulting case studies how journalism work on Instagram focussed on three specific and often interconnected practices: (1) personality focussed professional branding; (2) ‘lifestyle’ or aesthetic-focussed image posting aiming to foster community around a particular journalist and their reporting focus and (3) behind the scenes’ posting aiming to encourage and intimate and authentic connection with online audiences.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Surveying journalists in Vietnam, a socialist-communist country, this study attempts to bring insights into the effects of digital platforms on newsroom practices. Specifically, it looks at how journalists routinize the use of Facebook for various professional purposes. Additionally, this research examines journalists’ role conceptions and how these values influence news workers’ use of Facebook. Its findings show that journalists in this Southeast Asian country are embracing Facebook in their reporting, understanding audience, and branding. Results also indicate that the two important predictors of journalists’ Facebook use for work are the interpretive and populist-mobilizer functions of the news media. Theoretical implications of those findings are discussed in the context of a socialist-communist media system.\n","Abstract Body: Today’s communicative environment, including the rise of social media, makes journalists perform publicly as both professionals and private citizens. In these circumstances, practices of self-limitation and self-censorship may extend to online behavior. In this paper, we analyze what makes journalists in public affairs media limit themselves in expression, both in editorial production and in online posting. In particular, we pose four questions: whether their self-censoring is related to personal, editorial, or external factors; whether political threats triumph over personal self-branding and professional/commercial reasons; whether these factors work differently in editorial and online behavior; and whether the journalists behave differently on different social networks. We use the results of a survey of 95 journalists from 51 Russian regions and seven in-depth interviews. Our results show that, in an organizationally weak journalistic community that operates in a restrictive media and legal environment, understanding of self-censorship differs significantly from that in the Western democracies. It includes both self-limiting under pressures and personal-level ethical decisions that substitute professional codes of conduct. Also, for online posting and editorial work, there are different dominant ‘perceived censors’. Political threats remain the most important of all external pressures both online and offline, but personal motifs lead the decision-making in posting on social networks. Russia is characterized by platform-wide echo chambering and high differentiation between users of Facebook and the Russia-based VK.com; we observe this difference in the journalists’ descriptions of self-limitation on these networks.\n","Abstract Body: Recent scholarship suggests a growing interdependence between journalists and Twitter. But this raises the question: What is behind this interdependence, and how does it manifest in journalistic products? We argue that social media platforms (and Twitter in particular) have situated themselves as purveyors of legitimated content, a projection that journalists have not fully challenged and at times abetted. Instead, journalists rely on these platforms both for access to powerful users and as conduits to surface and amplify the words of \"\"ordinary people.\"\" This practice leads them to treat tweets more like content, an interchangeable building block of news, than like sources, whose ideas and messages must be verified. Turning to a corpus of U.S. news stories with tweets in them, our qualitative analysis is grounded in epistemic categories of journalistic knowledge and logics. We provide empirical evidence for our argument of the power of platforms to legitimate speech and shape journalistic routines and journalism itself. This study illuminates journalists’ role in transferring some of the press’s authority over information about current events to Twitter, thereby shaping the participants in and content of public deliberation.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study uses three archiving efforts at the <i>New York Times<\/i> as a means by which to analyze the transformation of historical editions for newspapers from analog to digital objects: the traditional “morgue” of physical clippings and photos, the joint project with Google Cloud to digitize the photo collection and the <i>TimesMachine<\/i> interactive digital archive, which includes scanned editions of printed issues from 1851 to 2002. Based on interviews with staff and analysis of over 30 publication of the NYT describing its past and present newspaper archiving practices, this paper makes three interrelated arguments: 1) There are a significant number of documents stored in physical archives that have not been translated to digital, and whose loss would be detrimental to historians and media scholars alike; 2) Even the documents that have been scanned and made available as digital objects do not perfectly mirror their analog equivalents, meaning that information loss is currently part of the digitization process; and 3) The online archive serves as a cultural intermediary, actively shaping journalistic practice and reframing current events in the context of the past.\n","Abstract Body: This conceptual paper makes the case for a metamodern culturalist perspective in the study of digital storytelling, a journalistic practice of rising cultural capital. Identifying oscillation as the overarching defining principle of digital journalism’s ontology, the paper argues that we must abandon old tropes related to postmodernism and instead situate journalism’s struggles for autonomy and authority within present-day culture’s structure of feeling. Metamodernism is defined by “an oscillation between a typically modern commitment and a markedly postmodern detachment”, which could be seen in the works of modern artists who “increasingly abandon the aesthetic precepts of deconstruction, parataxis, and pastiche in favour of <i>aesth-ethical<\/i> notions of reconstruction, myth and metaxis” (Vermeulen & van den Akker, 2010). Moving beyond postmodernist conceptualisations of journalism’s struggles over its identity helps shed light on journalism’s efforts to reinvent and rebuild itself in the post-truth age, and metamodernism offers a fruitful conceptual lens to study journalism’s oscillations between multiple forces and imperatives that vie for power over what journalism <i>is<\/i> and <i>should<\/i> be.\n","Abstract Body: Journalism research on military spaces, such as the naval base and military prison at Guantánamo Bay, tend to focus on the media’s role in circulating certain types of narratives. Though some studies have considered the history and mechanics of military censorship of journalists, the focus of this analysis has been almost exclusively on the power struggles that arise <i>after<\/i> media practitioners arrive at the site they are intending to cover. A question not thoroughly considered is <i>who <\/i>gets to access these sites and <i>what <\/i>mechanisms of government control are enacted in order to ensure that certain stories do not reach the ears and eyes of civilian audiences. Turning critical attention to the means in which military actors exert their power over journalists’ access to restricted spaces shows how defense agencies perceive and respond to informational threats to their command. Drawing on government documents obtained through the United States Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), this article first examines the U.S. Joint Task Force of Guantánamo’s process of vetting journalists who visit the base through the prism of media witnessing. In doing so, it offers a re-imagining of the definition of witnessing and proposes what I elect to call <i>predictive witnessing<\/i>, the use of analytical techniques to identify a priori certain media practitioners, whom the state waylays due to concerns over what they might convey to their audiences. This type of witnessing encompasses a form of organizational vetting that is attuned to the specific social, cultural, political, and legal dimensions of those who see and subsequently speak. To engage in predictive witnessing is therefore to attempt to limit not just <i>what <\/i>is seen but <i>who <\/i>does the seeing.\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines the surveillance of journalists during the Cold War in Germany to reveal that such surveillance is largely unaccounted for in the mnemonic and discursive landscape. It argues that contemporary Cold War narratives, as identified in museums and archives in Berlin, fail to robustly accommodate the issue of surveillance of journalists within the broader visual and discursive representations of Stasi-led surveillance. Instead, the surveillance of journalists is marked by absence and ambiguity, which results in the lack of a remembering community that is ultimately needed for a fuller accounting of the suppression, oppression, discrimination, and psychological harm inflicted by the secret police on journalists.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: The rise of fake news has posed numerous social problems, and its threats to journalism are multi-faceted. Not only do fake news stories take precious audience attention away from real news, real journalists producing real journalism have also been branded as “fake news’ peddlers by political actors who disagree with critical reporting. But a potentially long-term, and consequently more concerning, impact of the proliferation of fake news on information institutions, such as journalism, is that the rise of fake news might lead to a more cynical public that is quick to distrust information, including those coming from legitimate sources. This current project examined whether the rise of fake news is <i>poisoning the information well<\/i>. Based on two experiments, we find that perception of news media credibility decreases when participants are told they have seen a piece of fake news, regardless of whether the source of fake news is a legitimate or illegitimate source. This demonstrates the negative impact of fake news, regardless of the erring source. In contrast, perception of news media credibility does not change when participants are told they have seen a piece of real news. This is plausibly because this is what is expected from a well-functioning system. But when the system breaks down, the fault seems to be attributed to the information ecosystem in general, not to the specific source at fault.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Studies indicate that women reporters are underrepresented in newsrooms and assigned to gender-stereotypic roles, but to what effect? To better understand the role of gender in news making, this paper utilizes two survey experiments to investigate the effects of journalists’ gender on reader perceptions towards reporter credibility, outlet credibility, and the relevance of news to them. Despite a lack of main effects, the impact of reporter’s gender on perceived credibility is found conditional on the gender of the audiences, such that women reporters enjoy significantly higher ratings in perceived credibility from women readers, relative to the rating men reporters received from men readers. Our findings have implications for our understanding of women’s upward mobility in the newsroom and the costs associated with changing newsgathering routines.\n","Abstract Body: Legacy news media companies are under pressure as they are confronted with declining subscription rates and declining advertising revenues. A typical strategy to cope with this situation is, among others, tapping into new markets. Switzerland is an interesting case as media outlets in the three official languages German, Italian, and French could potentially reach audiences in their big neighbour countries France, Germany, and Italy. We tracked URL shares of Swiss online news media websites for two months on Twitter and combined them with the follower structures of the users (n=355’197 tweets, n=64’170 unique users) to detect specific user communities, i.e. segments of the audience. We thus are able to identify and compare the media repertoires of communities on Twitter and also propose metrics that take into account the temporal patterns of these Twitter media repertoires. Our results show that Swiss media indeed reach communities in foreing markets and also confirm the anecdotal evidence that some outlets target the German right-wing with their new “Germany strategy”.\n",null,"Abstract Body: <i>An extensive literature argues that the contemporary working class has largely disappeared from the news media. To analyse what characterises mediated representations of work life, labour and the working classes, the present article zooms in on the media coverage of two traditional working class sectors — the construction sector and the care sector — in legacy newspapers and the trade union press. Based on a systematic, quantitative content analysis, this article analyses the coverage over a period of 20 years (1996/7-2016/7) with an emphasis on salience, topical emphasis and voice. It finds a steady decline in media coverage throughout the period, indicating that coverage of work life and workers as part of a routine news beat is dwindling. Thematically, the analysis shows that labour coverage has gone from more informative coverage on workers right and working conditions to a stronger emphasis on work conflicts, recruitment problems and a lack of status for working class craftsmanship.<\/i> <i>In mapping news sources, this article also finds that the coverage of the two working class sectors is elite dominated and that female workers with ethnic minority backgrounds lack a voice in the coverage of their work life.<\/i>\n","Abstract Body: <i>1. Media Convergence and Journalistic Quality<\/i><br />One of the decisive developments in the digitalization of journalism is the convergence of previously separate ways of workflows in producing and distributing information (e.g. Deuze, 2008; Hohlfeld, 2018; Jenkins, 2006). Generally speaking, media convergence takes place on four different levels: organization, planning, production and publication. Although communication science has accompanied convergence processes in media companies for a long time, it has so far largely omitted studying the effects of convergence on the quality of content. Instead, the focus has been more on organizational and institutional issues (García Avilés et al., 2009; García Avilés et al., 2014; Meier, 2007; Meier et al., 2017; Kaltenbrunner & Meier, 2013; Rautenberg, 2016; Reich, 2011; Singer, 2004; Verhovnik et al., 2017) or the consequences from a legal perspective (e.g. Kirchhof, 2012) for journalistic identity (e.g. Deuze & Witschge, 2018) and for audiences (e.g. Mahrt, 2014; Urban & Schweiger, 2014).<br /><br />The question of how digitalization in general and working conditions in convergent media environments in particular influence the quality of journalism in German-speaking countries is being discussed intensively within the industry (Hamburg Media School, 2019), but data and research results are still rare. One of the main problems is that for the complex measurement of quality in convergent media environments many of the standard methods are no longer sufficient. We are currently devoting several research projects to this problem and would like to present their methodology and key challenges at the 70<sup>th<\/sup> Annual ICA Conference.<br /><br />Our approach focuses on diversity as an essential factor of journalistic quality, as it serves the democratic process of opinion-forming and decision-making (McQuail, 1991, p. 116). Furthermore, we see diversity measurement in the digital environment as the foremost challenge for communication science. We are dealing with two major research questions:<br /><br /><i>How does convergence affect diversity in news journalism?<br />What methodological challenges do we face if we want to make this diversity measurable?<\/i><br /><br /><i>2. State of Research on Media Convergence and Quality<\/i><br />Among the research projects that have already dealt with the effects of media convergence on journalistic performance (e.g. Neuberger et al., 2009; Quandt, 2005; Wilczek, 2018), some studies stand out: Rinsdorf (2011) found that media diversity at the regional level can decrease if previously separate editorial offices are being merged. Berghofer et al. (2014) could not show a significant correlation between the cooperation intensity of print and online media and lack of diversity within the topic structure of German tabloid media. Hofstetter and Schönhagen (2015) have shown in a qualitative study in Switzerland that, in addition to opportunities in editorial convergence, many journalists fear the danger of a decline in classic journalistic skills and thus also in journalistic quality.<br /><br /><i>3. Diversity Measurement<\/i><br />Diversity can and should be analyzed at different levels. The subdivision of diversity into functional diversity, structural diversity and content diversity is established in communication science (Schatz & Schulz, 1992). At the macro-level, functional diversity refers to the number of journalistic units on the print market (e.g. Schütz, 2012) and the number of transmitters/channels on the broadcasting market (e.g. Brosius & Zubayr, 1996; Dupré & Donsbach, 1994). At the meso-level, structural diversity comprises genres and departments (e.g. Engesser, 2013; Rossmann, Brandl, & Brosius, 2003) as well as different journalistic or program formats (e.g. Gehrke & Hohlfeld, 1995; Kolb, 2015; Maurer, 2009; Rossmann et al., 2003; Schatz & Schulz, 1992). At the micro-level, this refers to the diversity of content. More precisely, the diversity of sources, actors, opinions, topics, places of action, news factors and cultural/ethnic groups contained in a journalistic article (e.g. Engesser, 2013; Gehrke & Hohlfeld, 1995; Köster & Wolling, 2006; Schatz & Schulz, 1992).<br /><br />While former studies measured the degree of diversity by the number or relevance of indicators (e.g. Arnold, 2009; Engesser, 2013; Meier, 2006; Mehlis, 2016; Wyss, 2002), more recent ones combine content analyses with subsequent surveys, in which the diversity of a contribution is measured by content analysis first and is then evaluated as a stimulus by the respondents with regard to perceived diversity (e.g. Urban & Schweiger, 2014; Voigt, 2016). This is certainly the best way to do justice to the complexity of the construct of diversity – but converging media spaces present new challenges for its measurement.<br /><br /><i>4. Challenges in the Convergent Media World<\/i><br />To adequately investigate the influence of media convergence on diversity, it is necessary to develop instruments that measure the degree of digitization or convergence of a medium (macro- and meso-level) as well as the diversity of its outputs on the levels of production, distribution and consumption (micro-level).<br /><br />In the project we would like to present, the degree of organizational convergence in news journalism will be examined through expert interviews with editorial and program managers combined with editorial observations.<br /><br />Additionally, we will measure diversity at the level of media actors, within editorial offices at the departmental level and also at the level of the diversity of content of articles and contributions. At the macro-level, we will focus on the number and types of opinion-relevant newspapers/magazines on the print market and broadcasters on the broadcasting market. At the meso-level, the structural diversity must be examined and thus the number and types of departments/categories or program types. Besides, we will measure the diversity of content at the micro-level in print, radio and online products through the beforementioned categories. Therefore, we want to develop and test (partially) automated methods of diversity measurement in order to create diversity indices on as broad of a data basis as possible. The diversity indicators at the micro- and meso-levels will also be assessed concerning their occurrence, importance and their perceived change in surveys of editorial staff and recipients.<br /><br />The selection of editorial teams to be investigated through the surveys, observations and content analyses will be based on criteria such as their coverage or degree of editorial convergence.<br /><br />(968 words)<br /><br /><i>Literature<\/i><br />Arnold, K.

This study tests whether worldwide news coverage varies at either end of the age spectrum. The study is more than an exploration of a rarely examined variable, for it also examines journalism as cultural expression in an era when nationalism has gained global valence.\n","Abstract Body: <i>1. Media Convergence and Journalistic Quality<\/i><br />One of the decisive developments in the digitalization of journalism is the convergence of previously separate ways of workflows in producing and distributing information (e.g. Deuze, 2008; Hohlfeld, 2018; Jenkins, 2006). Generally speaking, media convergence takes place on four different levels: organization, planning, production and publication. Although communication science has accompanied convergence processes in media companies for a long time, it has so far largely omitted studying the effects of convergence on the quality of content. Instead, the focus has been more on organizational and institutional issues (García Avilés et al., 2009; García Avilés et al., 2014; Meier, 2007; Meier et al., 2017; Kaltenbrunner & Meier, 2013; Rautenberg, 2016; Reich, 2011; Singer, 2004; Verhovnik et al., 2017) or the consequences from a legal perspective (e.g. Kirchhof, 2012) for journalistic identity (e.g. Deuze & Witschge, 2018) and for audiences (e.g. Mahrt, 2014; Urban & Schweiger, 2014).<br /><br />The question of how digitalization in general and working conditions in convergent media environments in particular influence the quality of journalism in German-speaking countries is being discussed intensively within the industry (Hamburg Media School, 2019), but data and research results are still rare. One of the main problems is that for the complex measurement of quality in convergent media environments many of the standard methods are no longer sufficient. We are currently devoting several research projects to this problem and would like to present their methodology and key challenges at the 70<sup>th<\/sup> Annual ICA Conference.<br /><br />Our approach focuses on diversity as an essential factor of journalistic quality, as it serves the democratic process of opinion-forming and decision-making (McQuail, 1991, p. 116). Furthermore, we see diversity measurement in the digital environment as the foremost challenge for communication science. We are dealing with two major research questions:<br /><br /><i>How does convergence affect diversity in news journalism?<br />What methodological challenges do we face if we want to make this diversity measurable?<\/i><br /><br /><i>2. State of Research on Media Convergence and Quality<\/i><br />Among the research projects that have already dealt with the effects of media convergence on journalistic performance (e.g. Neuberger et al., 2009; Quandt, 2005; Wilczek, 2018), some studies stand out: Rinsdorf (2011) found that media diversity at the regional level can decrease if previously separate editorial offices are being merged. Berghofer et al. (2014) could not show a significant correlation between the cooperation intensity of print and online media and lack of diversity within the topic structure of German tabloid media. Hofstetter and Schönhagen (2015) have shown in a qualitative study in Switzerland that, in addition to opportunities in editorial convergence, many journalists fear the danger of a decline in classic journalistic skills and thus also in journalistic quality.<br /><br /><i>3. Diversity Measurement<\/i><br />Diversity can and should be analyzed at different levels. The subdivision of diversity into functional diversity, structural diversity and content diversity is established in communication science (Schatz & Schulz, 1992). At the macro-level, functional diversity refers to the number of journalistic units on the print market (e.g. Schütz, 2012) and the number of transmitters/channels on the broadcasting market (e.g. Brosius & Zubayr, 1996; Dupré & Donsbach, 1994). At the meso-level, structural diversity comprises genres and departments (e.g. Engesser, 2013; Rossmann, Brandl, & Brosius, 2003) as well as different journalistic or program formats (e.g. Gehrke & Hohlfeld, 1995; Kolb, 2015; Maurer, 2009; Rossmann et al., 2003; Schatz & Schulz, 1992). At the micro-level, this refers to the diversity of content. More precisely, the diversity of sources, actors, opinions, topics, places of action, news factors and cultural/ethnic groups contained in a journalistic article (e.g. Engesser, 2013; Gehrke & Hohlfeld, 1995; Köster & Wolling, 2006; Schatz & Schulz, 1992).<br /><br />While former studies measured the degree of diversity by the number or relevance of indicators (e.g. Arnold, 2009; Engesser, 2013; Meier, 2006; Mehlis, 2016; Wyss, 2002), more recent ones combine content analyses with subsequent surveys, in which the diversity of a contribution is measured by content analysis first and is then evaluated as a stimulus by the respondents with regard to perceived diversity (e.g. Urban & Schweiger, 2014; Voigt, 2016). This is certainly the best way to do justice to the complexity of the construct of diversity – but converging media spaces present new challenges for its measurement.<br /><br /><i>4. Challenges in the Convergent Media World<\/i><br />To adequately investigate the influence of media convergence on diversity, it is necessary to develop instruments that measure the degree of digitization or convergence of a medium (macro- and meso-level) as well as the diversity of its outputs on the levels of production, distribution and consumption (micro-level).<br /><br />In the project we would like to present, the degree of organizational convergence in news journalism will be examined through expert interviews with editorial and program managers combined with editorial observations.<br /><br />Additionally, we will measure diversity at the level of media actors, within editorial offices at the departmental level and also at the level of the diversity of content of articles and contributions.

Such journalism reports on new health research findings and can act as a lever for public health (Winett & Wallack, 1996) by encouraging people to search for more information and share it with others on online platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Readers engage in such follow-up actions after reading health news about two-thirds of the time, which is double the follow-up effort seen with entertainment, sports, and business news (Mitchell, Gottfried, Shearer, & Lu, 2017). Many of readers’ follow-up actions act as “cues” indicating other readers’ interest in, as well as the importance and popularity of, health news. This response and uptake of research on social media has become a part of public engagement, with a call among researchers to explore “online interactions about science in much greater detail” (Brossard & Scheufele, 2013). This becomes all the more important given the news media’s strong influence on health beliefs and behaviours (Cappella, Lerman, Romantan, & Baruh, 2005; Fan & Holway, 1994; Yanovitzky & Stryker, 2001).<br />The proposed research therefore takes an innovative and interdisciplinary approach that recognizes the role of social media in science reporting today. It does so by building on established theories of media framing and agenda setting while recognizing that the changing media landscape challenges these theories. In doing so, the study seeks to support improved communication of health science through a deeper understanding of how and among whom research circulates online.<br />To achieve this goal, the project will use the unique opportunities provided by social media to observe audiences and answer the overarching research question: How well and in what ways do the news media advance public awareness and understanding of health research? More specifically, the project tackles the following:<br />RQ1. What are the characteristics of the research, in terms of topic, publication venue, public availability, study design, and aspect of health concern (e.g., detection, prevention, or therapy), that affect the attention it receives from the news media?<br />RQ2. How do news media portray this research, in terms of the type of news story (e.g., covering an issue or communicating science) and how it is framed (e.g., as valid or controversial science)?<br />RQ3. What are the characteristics of the news stories that cover the research, in terms of topic, outlet, type of story, and framing, that affect the size and nature of the audience it finds on social media?<br />RQ4. a) How do the audiences of the research articles (e.g., self-identified profession or gender) differ from the audiences of the news stories about the research, as seen through the engagement both receive on social media? and b) How do the characteristics studied in RQ1 and RQ3 affect these differences?<br />The first phase of this project focuses on identifying and describing the characteristics of the health research that receives attention from the news media (e.g., topic, publication venue, public availability, study design, and aspect of health concern), as well as of the news stories themselves (e.g., outlet, story type, and framing). This phase will build on results from a pilot study exploring media coverage and framing of opioid-related research (Matthias, Fleerackers & Alperin, under review), and will be the primary focus of the work presented at ICA 2020.<br />We will identify and describe health-related research covered in online news and identify what research receives the most online media attention. This is key to understanding the role that the news media play in connecting publics with scholarly research. A medical librarian on our team will identify a relevant set of research articles from five health-related topics of public concern: lung cancer, opioid-related disorders, obesity, stroke, and HIV prevention. We chose these topics because they cover a range of public health concerns identified as important by the Centers for Disease Control (2017), which makes for varied case studies, and because they align with the interests of graduate students who have been identified to work on the project.<br />We will use our snapshot of the Altmetric database to identify the titles and URLs of news stories that have mentioned (linked to) the research our librarian identifies over the previous two years, performing a detailed analysis of which types of research receive media attention, how much, and in what outlets. This includes identifying what aspects of the health concern are covered (e.g., detection, prevention, or control, as identified by indexing keywords), the article type (e.g., editorials or research articles), public availability of the article (i.e. open access or not), as well as the nature of the news outlet (e.g., newspapers, magazine, or web-exclusive outlets; cf Hinnant et al., 2017). This analysis will serve as a benchmark to compare across health concerns, research document characteristics, and media outlet characteristics.<br />In the subsequent phases, we will conduct content analyses of the news stories themselves by loading the text of the online news stories into NVivo using a codebook adapted from Antilla (2005), Ruhrmann et al. (2015), and Guenther et al. (2019) for a recent pilot study (Matthias et al., under review). Each news story will be classified as having its primary purpose to share research findings or as addressing a larger issue, with research mentioned as only part of the story. Each mention (a story may contain more than one) will be coded as framing the science as valid, uncertain, or controversial.<br />By studying the role of media and social media in connecting publics with research-based health information, the project has the potential to highlight innovative health reporting practices that will encourage academics, journalists, and others to more effectively engage publics online and thus to elevate the quality of public discourse. By investigating what research receives attention from the news media, how it is framed, and who engages with it, this project will advance understanding of how the news media’s coverage of health research influences public uptake of this knowledge, and can improve the general state of public health awareness.<br /><br /><br /><b>References<\/b><br />Antilla, L.

In the narrative space of the global media, the tragedy of Somalia has been neglected for a long time, and it is difficult to be fully presented in a series of long news coverage. Modern civilization attaches great importance to equality and respect, while brings about differences and inequalities. The description of misery by mass media and people's perception of misery should not be confined by geography. However, the difference of status in the international political structure determines the distribution of media attention, thus affecting the public's perception of distant misery. Based on the framing theory, social construction of reality and politics of empathy, this paper explores the discourse strategies of the American media in the aspects of purpose, content, mode, value and effect by means of discourse analysis and literature research, taking 802 reports of The New York Times on famine in Somalia from 1960 to 2017 as the research object.<br /><br />The study finds that the independence movement of Somalia to get rid of colonialism, the outbreak of the Ogaden War, the end of the cold war, the September 11 terrorist attacks and the establishment of a new Somalia’s government divide the US-Somalia relationship into five stages. Accordingly, the discourse strategy of the media and the image-building of the victims have undergone a stage-by-stage transformation process, namely, using the method of “digitalization” to display the image of the hungry people as the background, employing the visual metaphor to disseminate the documentary pictures of the victims by means of “fear appeals”, applying the victim being weakened to become the exhibits of famine by resorting to “aesthetic construction of disasters”, replacing the individuals with the collective attributes under the strategy of “impersonalization”, and constructing the suffering world of “others” through the method of “familiar defamiliarization”. The core discourse strategy of each stage is the product of the specific social ideology and foreign policy at that time, which caters to the certain audience psychology. The victims of famine wander among the multiple identities of “refugees”, “the mob”, “people with contagious diseases”, “people of failed countries” and “terrorists” in the media presentation, thus promoting the value dissemination and meaning flow of the image symbols of specific famine victims in the public emotional space.<br /><br />At the same time, the discourse function and rhetoric direction of the reporting texts in different periods also have some similarities, which are embodied in the standard formula and chronological pattern of famine coverage, the domestication of suffering by mass media from the perspective of “cognitive dissonance theory”, and the meaning flow of cultural contracts embedded in the media narrative space.<br /><br />In a word, the mediated pain and politics of empathy depend on the cultural norms of media, and the vocabulary system and narrative strategies of reporting enhance the value of suffering in media. The famine in Somalia has been constructed as the fate of the backward regime and the appendage of poverty. The significance of international relief operations in the media texts is not to completely end a series of humanitarian disasters that endanger the lives of countless people, but to shape the heroic temperament of developed countries and demonstrate their moral determination to “make the whole world better”. Without breaking away from national interests, news reports further strengthen the position of power in the international political structure by emphasizing the distinction between“us”in the safe world and“others”in the disordered world.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This article analyzes the legal issues surrounding computational journalism and the emerging routines of journalists’ enactment with algorithms and data. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with journalists and editors. By utilizing a theoretical framework based on structuration theory, this article illustrates how those who work with algorithms and data in newsgathering and news production are both enabled and constrained by legal regulation, organizational policy, and professional journalism norms. The closing discussion argues that affirmative policies are needed to establish and maintain press freedom and autonomy in computational journalism.\n","Abstract Body: This paper reports on a #metoo campaign by a mainstream news organisation. The campaign was innovative not only in topic, but in that it used a mixture of mainstream and non-mainstream journalistic methods. The campaign generated a high number of disclosures from survivors and was notable for its adoption of a survivor-led approach, in its efforts to minimise potential harm to survivors. The campaign offers lessons for journalists reporting on MeToo issues, including best practice for dealing with survivors, campaign management, editorial process for dealing with the resulting stories, and ultimately the implications for editorial hierarchies and news values.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Abstract<br />A growing body of research documents the impacts of online audience metrics on news production and consumption in digital age. However, the research gap remained as how news release time can influence the online audience metrics. Based on the preliminary research investigating how audience clicks and reposts vary in different release time, this study examines 1) whether release time could influence audience reposts through audience clicks and 2) how release time interact with news contents to predict the level of audience clicks and reposts. From March 2015 to April 2015, a total of 171845 pieces of news was collected on Toutiao.com, a flagship news aggregator in China. Results showed audience clicks fully mediated the relationship between release time and audience reposts. Also, topic as one facet of news content moderates the indirect effect of release time on audience reposts through audience clicks, while visual complements as another facet (i.e., image, video) have no such moderating effects.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: release time, audience metrics, news content, news aggregator<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br />Journalists include ordinary people as exemplars in news stories to put a face on a larger societal issue or problem. These vivid personal accounts from exemplars tend to dominate the more abstract and general base-rate information and carry greater weight when people form their perceptions or attitudes on the problem at hand. Since the more abstract base-rate information is often provided or interpreted by expert sources, we explore whether vivid accounts from exemplars also affect how people perceive and assess the expert sources when both types of sources are included in a news story. Such an effect is likely to be driven by the emotional response that an exemplar evokes. In contrast with most other studies, we measure the emotional arousal directly through skin conductance, and indirectly through both open-ended and close-ended self-reports. We find that viewers of a news story on television experience increased arousal when they watch the personal account of an exemplar, and that they interpret the base-rate information in the news story in the light of the exemplar’s account. Furthermore, some respondents tend to delegitimize the expert source that contradicts the account of the exemplar. Finally, we discuss the implications for journalists.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Trust in the news media and the role of journalism in society is currently highly discussed. Media outlets are concerned about their trustworthiness and consider how to strengthen their audience’s trust in them. Journalism outlets that want to work on the trust relationship with their audiences have two main starting points. We argue that, one, journalism can work on the perceived risk of its performance: if recipients hold a better perception of the specific risk connected to the journalistic content, they are in the position to form better, clearer judgments on whether or not to trust the outlet. Two, journalism can try to actively work on its trustworthiness and to put out signals that prove it. One influential way to both increase trustworthiness and sharpen risk perception is often seen in journalistic transparency. This article examines which elements constitute the process of trust in journalism and how transparency as a trust-building strategy influences this process—and therefore the trust relationship between journalism and recipients. In order to shed light on the concepts of trust, risk and transparency as well as their connection, we conducted a representative survey of 1.029 media users in Germany. Our study shows that transparency can be a way for news outlets to increase their trustworthiness and to improve risk perceptions, which in turn presents a way to restore and strengthen trust in their work.<br />The results enable us to develop a more defined view of the concepts of risks and trust in journalism, along with indications for journalistic practice on how to work more transparently and to win (back) trust.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Based on data collected in three waves of news-item reconstructions, this paper presents longitudinal evidence according to which the role of digital news sources has grown dramatically since 2006, but traditional sources maintain their dominance. The study includes the reconstructions of 1,594 news items, authored by a representative sample of news reporters, and details regarding each item’s sources (n=5,647). Findings show that digital sourcing did not open the gates for alternative voices, in accordance with traditionalist approach. Against expectations, digital sources are verified less than non-digital ones and are mentioned less often in final publications, but in depth interviews indicate that rather than being blinded by technology’s façade of objectivity, reporters use lower epistemic standard due to what epistemologist define as reliance without trust. Reporters continue to adhere to elite’s output, albeit their efforts to diversify their sources, due to a familiarity paradox; the non-familiarity that makes alternative sources theoretically desired to reporters who wish to diversify, is what also makes them undesirable as unfamiliarity is associated with risk.\n","Abstract Body: Exploring the expertise of journalists in their domains of coverage becomes crucial due to the overwhelming assault on the institution of expertise in “post truth” societies; the still disputed nature of expertise among scholars; and the role of reporters and commentators as mega brokers of expert knowledge from all disciplines (outside one's own expertise). To conceptualize journalistic expertise, we juxtapose theories from sociology, pedagogy and philosophy and the insights of 14 current and former editors-in-chief from leading Israeli media, who were asked to analyze the expertise of their journalists. The paper suggests that the expertise of specialized knowledge-brokers (e.g. journalists, teachers, librarians) can be modeled across four continua: whether their knowledge is <i>homogenous <\/i>or <i>heterogeneous<\/i>? Can they <i>do<\/i> things or “just” <i>talk <\/i>about them? how do their <i>content knowledge<\/i> and <i>brokering knowledge <\/i>interact? and are they <i>insiders <\/i>or <i>outsiders<\/i> in the knowledge community?\n","Abstract Body: This study adopted the concepts of news paradigm and information subsidies to examine the changes in political news reporting in Hong Kong, which was shown to be a specific context to examine how the shift of political power centers affected news production. A quantitative content analysis of sourcing patterns of press reports regarding the Interpretations of the Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPCSC) after the Handover of Hong Kong indicated a rising trend in the use of sources from the Chinese Government officials and the pro-China camp. In-depth interviews with political journalists revealed that the influence of the Chinese Government on the media exceeded that of the Hong Kong Government. The current asymmetrical dual-power structure has induced dramatic changes in source power and sourcing adoption, indicating a shifting process of news paradigm. Newspaper outlets and journalists are facing struggles on and threats to the professionalism in journalism.\n","Abstract Body: A significant part of sources in political journalism are informal or not mentioned in media content. These sources inspire news, influence the angles and framing. However, their input is not being consistently measured. To what extend informal or/and invisible sources are used, what is their role and why? This paper offers a new tool to map and compare the usage of formal/informal and visible/ sources. The data consists of 575  journalist-source interactions in Lithuania and Sweden, gathered via the reconstruction interviews (Reich, 2009). The journalist-source interactions are analysed looking into individual, organizational and cultural aspects<br />The results indicate that more than a half of all interactions are invisible and/or informal. Informality for journalists and their sources becomes a tool to complete the professional tasks. Even though the formal elite sources are quoted more often, the majority of stories is inspired by the invisible sources. Formal invisible sources act as the gate-keepers and the informal invisible are the agenda-setters. Informality is used similarly in both of the countries, visibility – differently. It calls for further comparative research of journalism and political communication culture.<br />\n","Abstracts: Some of the first significant contributions to open data journalism in the US in the early twenty first century involved crime data. From Chicagocrime.org to Everyblock and the <i>Los Angeles Times<\/i> algorithmic journalism blog, Homicide Report, journalists have used police data to generate news, create open source ways to engage with communities and win awards. While these projects adhere to crime news norms and practices as well as open source intentions, they also provide insight into persistent critiques and challenges related to the aims of both data journalism -- and journalism in general. Specifically they highlight the tensions and harmful relationships created when data on vulnerable populations, data journalism’s positivist orientation are not brought alongside extensive critique about the social construction of race and journalism’s long history of social control, harm and ongoing colonialism(s).\n","Abstract Body: In the United States, mainstream news is framed as an agent of democracy, that promotes and protects the voice of the people. However, in practice, news organizations traditionally privileged the perspectives of white, middle-class Americans, while mis- and underrepresenting the social realities of marginalized individuals. This is especially true for individuals who hold multiple marginalized or intersectional identities, defined as those identities are impacted by two or more systems of oppression. Engaging information poverty theory, this study uses secondary survey and trace data analysis to examine the traditional, online, and social media news seeking and consumption habits of black women, as an example of an intersectional community, in order to see if having an intersectional identity leads to information seeking habits that create information poor environments. Findings from this study suggest that being black and a woman can act as a predictor of information seeking and news consumption habits that would form an information poor environment. Implications of these findings on news as a tool for democracy are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This presentation will detail the rationale, conceptual underpinnings and methodological approach of a major Research Council’s United Kingdom (RCUK) funded interdisciplinary study aiming to provide a non-partisan yet ‘integrated’ formulation of freedom of the press. The paper will outline preliminary findings from this ongoing project as well as initial reflections on the data gathered thus far. In providing the rational for the project, the authors signal the central problem of concern for the research as one of attempting to reconcile the tension between normative ethical considerations of news production with the practicalities of regulating news work.\n","Abstract Body: This study takes the definition of Violence Against Women (VAW) by the Council of Europe’s (CoE) Istanbul Convention, whose notion is used interchangeably with that of Gender-Based Violence (GBV), to address its main question: What is the place of visual imagery – still and moving images and even memes, to online harassment against women (photo-) journalists, i.e., journalists and photojournalists, and under which conditions online abuse might be entangled with offline aggressive behaviour? Scholarly studies focus on the challenges to women (photo-) journalists, however the ways in which VAW has been addressed - by focusing either on online or on offline or on visual, have not taken into consideration all aspects together and in their (possible) interconnections. This study combines a computer-mediated survey, in-depth interviews and focus groups, also making use of innovative tools, such as Virtual Exchange. By employing a comparative and an intersectional approach, this project integrates a gender-based investigation, focusing on European countries, particularly on Italy and Sweden.\n","Abstract Body: The aim of this exploratory study is to explore how journalists who claim to cover social justice define news that they communicate to their audiences. This article builds on Gans’ definition of what news is, on recent conceptualizations of discursive understandings of journalistic performance, and on how emotion is used to understand and operationalize journalists’ roles. Based on qualitative interviews with journalists who cover social justice topics, our findings suggest that they are discursively constructing emotion and emotional labor as central to what news is in society. They seek to guide, inspire, connect, and manage emotion and the well-being of their audience members and the issues they cover. This article adds to theoretical and practical understandings of how journalists covering social justice issues discursively construct their role performance, and how emotions may contribute to contemporary understandings of what news is.\n","Abstract Body: Growing scholarship on lifestyle journalism has shown its relevance for society. A development of consumption cultures and societal changes have ensured that lifestyle journalism and the lifestyles it portrays have become a staple of people’s everyday media consumption. While lifestyle journalists’ roles have been explored in countries with developed economies and consumption cultures fewer have focused on countries with greater socio-economic inequality. Likewise, while we have some insight into what audiences expect of political journalists, we know little about expectations of lifestyle journalism, and how socio-economic inequality may shape these. This study draws on 22 in-depth interviews with lifestyle journalists and three focus groups with audiences from diverse socio-economic backgrounds in South Africa. We found that lifestyle journalists’ awareness of socio-economic disparity and the country’s history of racial segregation and oppression shapes their roles in two ways. First, journalists expressed strong support for traditionally political journalistic roles, interconnected with lifestyle roles. Second, journalists expressed a strong orientation towards the role to ‘provide aspiration’. Finally, the aspirational role features strongly among audience expectations indicating a level of congruence. Lifestyle journalism allows audiences who live under “conditions of scarcity” and have been conceptualized as having a “taste of necessity” (Bourdieu 1984), to perform a ‘taste of aspiration’. We suggest a need to reconceptualize our approach to studying journalistic roles by moving beyond the politics-lifestyle binary, and to more closely examine the role of aspiration in lifestyle journalism.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study provides an empirical and analytical look at the routines and norms that structure “advance” obituary writing, tracing how elite journalists construct, and <i>reconstruct<\/i>, the legacies of public figures long before their deaths through the relatively unexplored news form of the obituary. Through in-depth qualitative interviews with the elite journalists who wrote obituaries for former President George H. W. Bush, I offer a framework for understanding the norms and processes behind the construction of public figures’ legacies. Findings show the “advance” obituary defies conventional norms and temporal dimensions of newswork, and these divergences have important implications for the roles of time and context in legacy construction. Journalists uphold norms of objectivity and balance even as they integrate contradictory practices of contextualization and interpretation. Finally, journalists’ ability to decide what to keep in and leave out of the obituary imbues them with the cultural authority to make truth claims about how we remember the past. How stories about political life are told and retold, who has the power to tell them, and what they leave out underpins the very nature of democratic deliberation.\n","Abstract Body: This article applies Victor Turner’s schema of “social drama” to examine narrative rituals and the roles performed by a local and national newspaper in their coverage of the Umpqua Community College shooting that took place in October 2015. Stories from <i>The Roseburg News-Review<\/i> and the <i>New York Times<\/i> are compared in terms of the narrative’s movement from breach, crisis, redress, and finally to either reintegration or separation. This study finds that story progression of the national outlet stalls in a state of liminality to never achieve reintegration or separation, while pushing discourse toward moral dissent. The local newspaper performed media ritual to reinforce consensus to achieve the social good of healing and recovery. Both papers move the discourse on school shootings toward a societal ideal.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The black press is often conceptualized as an advocacy press but in the current digital environment this definition is malleable. Black press websites that primarily produce entertainment news create ambiguity about advocacy as a requirement. Informed by interviews with journalists and focus groups with readers this research finds that advocacy in the black press is fraught as entertainment advances it, by providing increased representation of African Americans, and threatens it, by decreasing hard news content.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Documentaries produced in 2017 for the 25<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary of the Los Angeles riots illuminate how archived news preserves the perspectives of a historical moment by maintaining a hierarchy of sources that ranks public officials and journalists as more authoritative than citizens. Alternative approaches to remembrance that use journalism’s tools and news archives but displace narrative authority based on status with narrative authority based on presence reveal what can happen when the hierarchy of sources changes.\n","Abstract Body: <br />In the past few years there has been a growing number of news blogs, podcasts, websites, and social media channels that talk about cultural and societal events from an intersectional perspective, actively considering the intersecting impact of race, gender, sexuality, class an occurrence may have on society. However, our understanding of what it practically means to create news from an intersectional standpoint or even how these news creators are defining intersectionality itself is ill-defined. This paper aims to fill this gap in knowledge through nine semi-structured interviews with ten news content creators leading this new wave of news creation. This study argues that intersectional news creators disrupt previous models of journalism that explicitly centered a singular identity, to a model of journalism that explicitly decenters any one particular identity, rupturing the hegemonic values embedded in previous forms of news media. This paper offers a model of journalism that is inherently open, and that works towards the democratic ideals deeply rooted in the goal of journalism.  <br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper will argue for the benefit of a new theoretical perspective based on fan studies, to examine what drives vitriolic and polarising debate. It will proceed in three parts: the first will situate online political discussion and polarisation within its traditional theoretical perspectives illuminating how this may leave critical dimensions of online political communication unrevealed; next it will examine the literature of fan studies to theorise how fannish behaviours fuels practices of participation as it relates to political discourse. It will also examine anti-fandom as a conceptual tool for understanding antagonism rife within online political discussion. Finally, it will finish by outlining a methodological approach for testing these theoretical interventions.\n","Abstract Body: How diverse are news sources selected by Google in search results? Our study seeks to investigate news source diversity in Google Search results in Germany, the UK, the USA, and France over the span of more than two years. To our knowledge, it is the first longitudinal study of Google Search results. To answer our research questions, we use data compiled by the search engine optimization company Trisolute.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines how technological affordances and one's political ideology affect the decision to share news via social media. In doing so, we categorize the levels of news sharing into three levels to see how each level of news sharing is influenced by the variables of interest. By using a survey collected by Nielsen Company Korea (N=1,068), we ran three logistic regression models to see how technological affordances available on social media platforms and one’s political ideology increase or decrease the odds of the level of news sharing behaviors. We found that different types of technological affordances (e.g., anonymity, openness, interactivity, etc.) can facilitate the process of news sharing via social media. Political ideology had an impact on the most active level of news sharing (i.e., sharing news by adding one’s own commentary). These findings provide the foundation for theory building for news sharing processes by offering some initial evidence on what has been missing from existing literature – specifically elements of technological affordances and the role of individual factors. Additionally, this study adds a finding from a non-U.S. centric national context, enriching the literature that explains news sharing behaviors.\n","Abstract Body: <br />The 2018 Nielson TV ratings show that traditional TV viewing is on a decline among young viewers, who prefer to spend more time on social media. In order to attract users to their content, TV news channels need to investigate the news agendas that result in higher engagement especially among Instagram users. Based on the agenda-setting perspective, this study examines the agendas that six TV channels make salient for Instagram users. It analyzes the content (3,000 Instagram posts) of six TV news channels from three countries: 1st Channel and Russia 24 (Russia), CNN and Fox News (USA), Times Now and CNN-News18 (India) to understand the engagement and agendas these channels promote on Instagram. This study aims to further the understanding of social media-based news broadcasting, especially that of Instagram as an emerging agenda-setting network.\n","Abstract Body: Study purpose<br />The purpose of the current study is twofold. First, this study aims to examine the well-known agenda-setting hypothesis in the new media environment where the audience are empowered by digital technologies to actively search news and information (Bennett & Iyengar, 2008). Specifically, we look into the potential bidirectional link between online information search behavior and news media coverage. Second, this study aims to further ascertain the nuances of such relationship by taking issue attribute and time period into consideration. By doing so, we attempt to identify the conditions in which the causal influence between online information search and news media coverage varies.<br />Conceptual framework<br />Online information search query as public agenda  <br />Due to the development of digital media technology, online information search behaviors become prevalent in the last two decades (Gretzel & Yoo, 2008). It is a common practice for people to type in keywords known as search queries when they use search engines. Search query volume suggests collective interest in a certain topic or item. For example, search query volume can be seen as proxy to consumers’ interest in a product or service in consumer behavior studies (Hu, Du, & Damangir, 2014). Search query not only indicates the amount of interest, but also can be regarded as a behavioral form of issue salience. Search implies a motivation to obtain information about an issue. If people search information about an issue, they must be at least aware of that issue and have a certain degree of commitment (Scharkow & Vogelgesang, 2011). Different volumes of search query indicate different levels of issue salience. The larger the search query volume of an issue is, the more salient that issue is to the public (Ragas, Tran, & Martin, 2014).<br />Agenda-setting in the new media environment<br />To regard search query as a behavioral dimension of issue salience is an up-to-date attempt and an extension of the traditional agenda setting research to the new media environment. With the evolvement of media landscape, ordinary people are empowered to search information about certain issues with which they are highly concerned.<br />News coverage can serve as a stimulus for online information search. People can be informed of an issue from news coverage. The rise of awareness towards an issue can induce subsequent information seeking in order to have a deep understanding of the issue. Roberts and his colleagues (2002) found that news reports on four social issues was positively related to information search and information discussion in electronic bulletin boards. Given these findings, we propose the first research hypothesis in this study:<br /><i>H1<\/i>: Media coverage of a certain social issue leads to more online information search about that issue.      <br />Although media coverage potentially leads to online information search, previous agenda-setting research also suggests that news media play a responsive role to public opinion (Nicolas Hopmann, Elmelundpræstekær, Albæk, & De Vreese, 2009). One critical catalyst to facilitate such a responsive role of news media is the commercialization and keen competition of the media industry all over the world (Nicolas Hopmann et al., 2009). Search query volume is one of the most prominent clues of public opinion nowadays. Researchers found that news media increasingly monitor online media platforms such as search engines, discussion forums, and social media for news clues and make news which addresses the audience’s feedback in recent years (Dick, 2011). The above argument leads to the second research hypothesis in the study:<br /><i>H2<\/i>: Online information search of a certain social issue leads to more media coverage of that issue.<br />Contingent effect of issue attribute and time period<br />Previous agenda-setting studies demonstrate that the agenda-setting effect can vary across different issues (Valenzuela & Arriagada, 2011). Soroka (2002) developed a typology differentiating prominent, sensational, and government issues which are characterized with different levels of issue obtrusiveness. The more obtrusive an issue is, the less media agenda-setting effect there will be.<br />In addition, time period might be another important condition under which the influence between online information search and media coverage can be different. For instance, during the election time, individuals are more concerned about different issues which are emphasized by candidates. One possible way for them to get informed is to use news media. Therefore, if the above argument holds, news media will play a more influential role during the election time compared with the non-election time. However, few previous studies have examined the influence of time period on agenda-setting effect. Thus, we ask two research questions:<br /><i>RQ1<\/i>: Do the relationships between online information search and media coverage vary across different issues?<br /><i>RQ2<\/i>: Do the relationships between online information search and media coverage vary between election period and non-election period?  <br />Method<br /><i>Data and analysis<\/i><br />To test the relationship between online information search and media coverage across issues and time periods, we collected the data from two sources: search query from Google Trends and media coverage of <i>The New York Times<\/i> and <i>Washington Post<\/i> from Factiva.<br />Both Google Trends data and media coverage are weekly time series data spanning from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018 for ten different issues including <i>sensational issues<\/i> (i.e.,  terrorism, immigration, climate change, and vaccine), <i>prominent issues<\/i> (i.e., jobs, minimum wage, and fuel) and <i>government issues<\/i> (i.e., gun control, social security, and health care). Figure 1 visualized these time series for ten issues.<br />[Figure 1 about here]<br />As an appropriate tool to analyze time series data, vector autoregression (VAR) analysis was employed to examine the causal relationship between search query and media coverage for ten specific issues. Three time periods (i.e., pre-election, election, and post-election) are examined separately. Similar to many existing studies with time series data, we mainly relied on Granger causality test to interpret the results of VAR models. Results of Granger causality tests are shown in Table 1.  <br />[Table 1 about here]<br />Preliminary findings<br />The analysis yields several important findings. First, there are reciprocal relationship between online information search and news coverage which are hypothesized by H1 and H2, although news coverage seems to be more responsive to online information search than the other way around.<br />Second, compared with non-election times, there are more interactions between news coverage and online information search during election times for all issues. Specifically, people become more attentive to news coverage during election times.<br />Third, the relationships do vary across different issues. In terms of sensation issues, online information search is more likely to be influenced by media coverage. In terms of prominent issues, online information search is less likely to be influenced by media coverage. In terms of government issues, online information search is more likely to be influenced by media coverage during election times which might suggest that media coverage serves as an surrogate to government agenda during elections.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study brings together two central concerns of journalism studies: Engagement with news content on social media and trust. We will use a combination of survey research and content analysis to better understand the relationship between readers’ trust and the likelihood those readers will engage with news on social media by clicking, liking, sharing, or commenting on it. We include gender in our model as our analysis of existing data and previous research have found evidence for a gender dynamic to both trust and engagement.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates what kind of transparency appeals to what kind of public and to what extent transparency can be a remedy for journalisms lack of trust and credibility. The method is a representative survey of Swedes. The results show that there are three distinct forms of transparency, including the previously unreported ambient transparency, and that they appeal to different people. There are small or no effects by news consumption or social media use on transparency. The strongest effect on a positive view on transparency comes from appreciation of the current quality of journalistic performance, high trust in journalists and media, and having news media and authorities as the preferred channel of information. Those most skeptical to journalism are also the least positive to transparency. The results suggest that transparency has very limited reach as a cure for declining journalistic trust and credibility.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines why digital newsworkers organize labor unions, focusing on how they use union organizing statements to communicate their struggles to the public. By using these organizing manifestos, I argue that these unions produce a class ideology among digital newsworkers, while struggling to legitimize themselves as a viable actor that should shape journalistic authority in digital news industries.\n","Abstract Body: Recognizing that technology journalism remains under-studied in journalism studies, this article asks how UK technology journalists navigate relationships with the tech industry and how these relationships influence reporting practices. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with UK-based tech journalists, this article outlines three cotemporaneous articulations of technology journalism defined by the focus on the products of technology business, on the business of technology, and on the social implications or effects of technology. In providing a detailed account of the day-to-day news practices of the technology beat, the article also demonstrates how journalists manage a range of pressures, limitations, and challenges. Finally, it shows that, in how it is defined and practiced, tech journalism remains interlaced with the tech industry in ways that may undercut growing calls for critical, rigorous, and independent technology reporting. Ultimately, this article makes the case for treating technology journalism as a distinct field of inquiry.\n","Abstract Body: Recent developments in journalism seemingly curtail an enjoyable work environment and contribute to a situation in which journalists experience discrepancies between initial job expectations and actual day-to-day practices. Realizing such discrepancies can lead to disappointment and challenges journalists’ dedication to the job. Previous research indicates that young journalists are particularly affected by symptoms of the journalism crisis and, hence, demonstrate comparatively high intentions to leave their jobs. This study addresses this issue of disillusionment by examining whether young journalists’ initial job motivations and expectations are met or disappointed in journalistic practice. For this purpose, we apply Bourdieu’s concept of <i>illusio <\/i>to capture the reasons for their investment in the journalistic field. Based on in-depth interviews with 40 Austrian journalists we found that autonomy constitutes a key facet of the field’s illusio, both as an ideal of journalistic work as well as the superior reason to become a journalist despite the awareness of financial drawbacks. While respondents are disillusioned by the lack of autonomous decision-making in everyday work, they still adhere to the ideal of acting as autonomous providers of information and thus remain in the profession. Crucially, they believe that accepting drawbacks like periods of precarity as well as less autonomous work empowers them to better contribute to journalism’s societal mission.\n","Abstract Body: This paper proposes a theoretical tool to dissect as well as explain the global devaluation of<br />news labour. To that effect, I situate journalistic workers in a nexus of neoliberalism on three levels. The first<br />level maps the role of journalists as workers in a neoliberal labour regime, which illuminates how notions of<br />flexibility associated with freelancing and other non-permanent work in journalism reinforce neoliberal logics.<br />The second level maps the role of journalists as citizens, with neoliberalism as a version of government policymaking<br />shaping journalistic labour, either intensifying or alleviating precarity, depending on jurisdiction. The<br />third and last level maps governmentality in freelance journalism and intern labour, understood as strategies<br />for subject-constitution and self-governance in neoliberalism. This level explores contemporary journalists’<br />increasingly hybrid and fracturing professional identities which oscillate between an “entrepreneurial self”<br />aligning with neoliberal logics and an “ethical self” resisting these.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Journalists often debate what to call Donald Trump’s habitual departures from truth: lies, or euphemisms that stop short of suggesting willful deception? This paper proposes an empirical tool to supplement fact- checking procedures and address the practical challenge of identifying lies. Analyzing Trump’s tweets with a regression function designed to predict true and false claims based on their language and composition, our research finds significant evidence of willful deception underlying Trump’s inaccurate claims and makes the case for using \"\"lie\"\" to ascribe intent more frequently.\n","Abstract Body: Fact-checking has spread internationally, in part to confront the rise of digital disinformation campaigns. But American data suggests ideological asymmetry in acceptance, and further, greater acceptance among political sophisticates, limiting influence. We examine attitudes toward fact-checking across 6 European counties to put these findings in a broader context (N = 6,067). We find greater familiarity with and acceptance of fact-checking in Northern Europe (Sweden, Germany) than elsewhere (Italy, Spain, France, Poland). We further find that satisfaction with democracy and feelings toward the EU are associated with feelings toward fact-checkers in the countries examined, demonstrating that the ideological cleavage around fact-checking is not unique to the U.S. Overall, our findings offer a mixed portrait of public acceptance of fact-checking in Europe.\n","Abstract Body: This mixed-method study examined the fake news practices of fact-checkers from Mafindo, the only third-party fact-check organization in Indonesia. It conducted web observation to examine the information flows and patterns of fact-checkers in handling three natural disaster-related fake news cases. Next, based on HOI framework, fact-checkers were interviewed to understand factors affecting their fact-checking practices. Additionally, this study explored the role and positioning of Mafindo fact-checkers within Indonesian fact-checking ecology, specifically after a fact-checking alliance between 24 newsrooms and Mafindo was formed. Findings showed that Mafindo fact-checkers mostly sourced their information from news media and government, prompting fact-checked results to be published at a later time. They are driven by its organizational influence, specifically its culture that prides the outlet as the first third-party fact-check. Routines include non-bias towards any disaster-fake news cases and maintaining a consistent fact-checking writing format (e.g., compilation of evidences and resources). As part of the fact-checking alliance, third-party fact-checkers provide fact-checking assistance to other newsrooms and received benefit of professional training held by the alliance. However, their positioning could be challenged as values such as independence or neutrality are questioned.<br /><br /><br />Keywords: Fact-Checking; Fake News; Hierarchy of Influences Model; Third-party Fact-Checkers\n","Abstract Body: The current paper will probe the rise of conservative and populist fact-checking in political journalism. It will do so through a case study, as well as by contextualizing the current academic discourse on journalistic fact-checking in relation to the concerns about automated storytelling and platform-driven content curation. First, we will argue that fact-checking in political journalism today requires further elaboration of what scholars describe as the professionally solidified journalistic group of Beltway reporters and political bloggers (Graves 2016) or the institutional response to the perceived increase in political polarization among the electorate (Garrett et al. 2013). Fact-checking organizations such as PolitiFact and factcheck.org have teamed up with technology platforms to embed their fact-check ratings and evaluations in the daily diet of online newsreaders. Moreover, conservative news outlets have begun to not merely react to “elite” (Graves 2016) fact-checkers’ reporting but to create their own ratings system, and to fact-check stories on their own. Their style of fact-checking, however, has a peculiar undertone. We will argue that conservative—and often populist—fact-checkers are “reactive” and “paranoid.” We will call them “pedants.” They are reactive because their fact-checking efforts are admittedly aimed at counterbalancing what they see as liberal bias: focusing too much on conservative lawmakers’ and the current president’s errors or missteps, and thereby collectively—if involuntarily—advancing a liberal agenda. Conservative fact-checkers are also “paranoid,” as we borrow this term from Richard Hofstadter’s essay (1965) because behind the liberal mission they see a conspiracy between the elite and minority groups, where the two fight together to erode and ultimately displace traditional and conservative social values.\n",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Abstract Body: The ascension of Donald Trump from an outsider candidacy to president of the United States has provided ample dilemmas for journalists unaccustomed to blunt populist political rhetoric. Trump and his allies frequently attack journalists in an effort to delegitimize news coverage, while also positioning journalists as part of the ruling elite standing in the way of the people. Journalists struggle with how to respond, and are left to question the usefulness of their standard reporting practices and their normative commitments. Sorting through the frequent skirmishes between Trump and the press, as well as the resulting responses among the journalistic community, requires developing a contextual framework that gets beyond any single episode to instead make sense of this particular political and media moment.<br /><br />With this goal in mind, the purpose of this project is to craft an analytical position for evaluating Trump that is able to push back against a popular tendency to view him through an individualizing lens, one that accentuates what Max Weber would call his charismatic authority. This is a view Trump likes to espouse, but it is a path that only leads to a decontextualized view that is as mythologizing as it is inaccurate. Moreover, it is dangerous in that it shifts agency fully to Trump while downplaying the underlying structural shifts in politics and media that enable Trump and other populist politicians. Furthermore, it eschews a global perspective that would help recognize how these trends exist across borders and across time. Understanding structural shifts supports an argument that this is not just a passing moment, but rather a confluence of enduring factors that need to be confronted and acknowledged. This project addresses this challenge by seeking to develop a conceptual framework that emphasizes structural contingency over individual agency. This framework would then be useful for analyzing how journalists construct Trump’s agency through news discourse as well as public discussions about news.<br /><br />The starting point of this project is the argument that Trump cannot and should not be treated merely as a cause that has an effect, but rather should be understood as an effect stemming from broader causes. Understanding Trump and his relationship to the news media requires placing him within the context of converging forces that marks this particular moment. To this end, this project will argue that Trump needs to be understood as a symbol of a confluence of a confluence of political, journalistic, and technological shifts that ushered him into the Oval Office. A nuanced understanding of these shifts is needed to construct such a contextual framework.<br /><br />In terms of the political sphere. The polarization of the American electorate has altered how citizens experience politics, particularly as political preferences deepen into the terrain of identity (Mason, 2018). These trends toward political polarization follow a global uptick in right-wing populism that, while manifesting in different ways across national contexts, is marked by disdain for journalism (Waisbord, 2013). Part of assessing Trump is assessing this complex relationship between populism and the press (Krämer, 2018; McDevitt & Ferrucci, 2018). At the same time, care needs to be taken not to overstate the case of politically fragmented media ratcheting up political polarization (Dubois & Blank, 2018). There is also a need to reevaluate core assumptions about the electorate (Achen & Bartels, 2017) as well as assumptions of how news fits into normative democratic functioning (Schudson, 1998).<br /><br />Within this political environment, journalists have had to adjust to a number of structural shifts connected to digitization: the loss of control over information flows, the rise of platforms, and steep declines in advertising revenue. Moreover, decades of accusations of left-wing bias and elitism directed at journalists (Hemmer, 2016) are resulting in sizable cleavages in how the public views the press, with opinion surveys showing wide gaps in public trust in journalism around divides such as education and party affiliation (Ladd, 2011). Journalists have also drawn criticism for entrenched practices that favor elites and ignore marginalized people (Robinson & Culver, 2019).<br /><br />The outcome sought in this work-in-progress project is a contextual framework that does not reduce the current journalistic moment in the US to any one factor, but presents a balance of overlapping and contingent forces. This allows for highlighting the symbolic dimension of Trump beyond his presence as an individual. Developing this perspective helps attune scholars to a nuanced perspective for assessing what the populist political movement has meant for the authority of journalism in democratic places. It situates Trump within a long history of problematic practices within newsrooms that need to be explored.<br /><br />This project would benefit greatly from feedback from the ICA Journalism Studies Division community. As this project is a work-in-progress, the collaborative atmosphere of the conference provides a space for peers to help hone the framework and strengthen the argument. In addition, the global diversity of the division will introduce a wider array of experiences and examples beyond the US.<br /><br />References<br />Achen, C. H., & Bartels, L. M.

The study focuses on four broad themes: ability to combat compassion fatigue, accessibility, ethics, and perceived legitimacy.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Migration<\/i> has grown to be one of the most highly debated and transformative subjects of the last couple of decades. Migration is by no means a new phenomenon, but with the steady expansion of globalisation, many societies and peoples of this world are confronted with never before seen implications and effects resulting from the specific migration trends of these times. So much so, that some scholars would go so far as to call our time the <i>age of<\/i> <i>migration<\/i> (Castles, Miller, & Haas, 2014). The same is assumable for the subject of <i>irregular immigration<\/i>, which has gained massive political and social salience over the past few decades. The infamously dubbed <i>refugee <\/i>or <i>migrant crisis <\/i>alone has profoundly transformed the political and social landscapes of many countries. In Germany, the Netherlands, France, Austria, Belgium, Greece, etc. we have observed a rise of right-wing political parties, who have successfully shifted from the political margins into the political centres by effectively endowing the refugee issue with their anti-immigration stance (Barlai, Fähnrich, Griessler, & Rhomberg, 2017). It then comes as no surprise that especially highly institutionalised political actors such as governmental or oppositional parties, and large-scale supranational actors (e.g. UNHCR, European Union, African Union) etc. face high pressures to publicise their positions regarding irregular immigration. They have strong incentives to generate visibility, legitimacy and support resp. consent to secure or gain political power. The only way to place their positions, ideologies and/or policies into the public agenda is entering the <i>media discourse<\/i> using various narrative tools (Roselle, Miskimmon, & O’Loughlin, 2014).<br />These reflections provoke questions about the relation and effects between <i>interpretational sovereignty <\/i>or <i>power<\/i> of certain actors and <i>the media (resp. news, journalism) <\/i>concerning a broader political issue: What kind of actors successfully voice their opinion? Which actors get to define the issue and suggest solutions? What role do the news media play or resp. what role does journalism play regarding the allocation of interpretational sovereignty? And perhaps most importantly, what are the political implications of certain actors gaining interpretational sovereignty (through the means of media discourse)?<br />In terms of journalism studies and/or political communication research, these considerations partially relate to questions of <i>frame sponsorship<\/i> and <i>framing contests<\/i> between political actors within the media discourse in the context of social phenomena collectively perceived as crises. Over the past decade, there has been an influx of framing research related to frame sponsorship and contests aiming to comprehensively analyse the production of news text from an actor’s perspective. The research is however, somewhat flawed by a considerable neglect of considerations regarding (discursive) power structures, relations and effects (Carragee & Reofs, 2004). Many studies only marginally discuss questions of frame sponsorship and contests regarding implications of (non-) powerful actors disseminating their ideology via the media. Furthermore, there is a strong Western and euro-centric bias in (im)migration framing research. Especially in the case of refugee representations only very few studies are concerned with their narrative portrayals in non-Western contexts (Frontani, Silvestri, & Brown, 2009). These studies have not yet explicitly discussed that a large part of forced migration occurs in African regional contexts (UNHCR, 2017), which would legitimize academic concern for framing research in and about these regions.<br />This project follows, thus, two objectives: Firstly, it aims to establish a theoretical model that combines framing theory with hegemony theory to integrate considerations regarding (discursive) power structures and effects in the context of political communication. The basis for the model will be a specific conceptualisation of <i>hegemony <\/i>and <i>hegemonialisation<\/i> based on Adler (2015) and Laclau and Mouffe (2014) which integrates and lays focus on the role of the news media in the <i>distribution and allocation of interpretational sovereignty<\/i> of actors particularly relevant to a political issue. The model aids to conceptualise discursive power dynamics regarding the struggle for interpretational sovereignty amongst political actors and the news media. Hereby, it contributes to an integrative understanding of the relation between the media and political power during political and societal transformation processes. This follows the underlying assumption, that times of (global) crisis and political uncertainty evoke public struggles for interpretational sovereignty between politically relevant actors over the causes of and the remedies to a given social or political crisis (Entman, 2007; Laclau & Mouffe, 2014).<br />Secondly, this projects aims to test the empirical validity of this model by answering the question of <i>how governmental parties, oppositional parties, supra-national actors and the news media in sub-Saharan African and European refugee hosting countries discursively construct the Refugee Crisis <\/i>and <i>which of these actors are granted (interpretational) dominance within the refugee crisis media discourse by use of their narrative constructions (frames). <\/i><br />Thus, it investigates the interpretational power of political actors, who participate in the <i>refugee crisis<\/i> public debate in European and Sub-Saharan African main host countries (Uganda, Kenya, Germany, France; UNHCR, 2017). The comparison between these countries refers to the overall persistent geopolitical hierarchy and historical imbalance of economic resources between states of the Global South and the Global North. This contextual environment is expected to bare explanatory relevance to the discursive behaviour of highly institutionalised political actors (government parties, opposition parties and large supra-national actors) and the news media in context of the <i>refugee crisis. <\/i><br />To assess how and with which frames certain actors are hegemonialised in the context of the alleged <i>refugee crisis, <\/i>a content analysis is conducted. Hereby, I mainly analyse which frames resp. frame-elements and their sponsors are present in the top circulating newspapers – representing different positions of the political spectrum. The content analysis is guided by a codebook mainly containing deductively developed frames resp. frame-elements. The codebook’s – or rather the categories’ – reliability is currently being tested. <br />Theoretically, conceptually and empirically, this project is concerned with the role of the media in the allocation of interpretational power of political actors in times of crisis, which in turn can be considered as profoundly transformative processes that affect both political and societal landscapes.<br /><br />Literature<br />Adler, D.

However, the lack of professional and ethical structures in journalistic practices can be attributed mainly to political and economic pressures as well as deep-seated political and sectarian divisions. This situation reinforces citizens’ negative attitudes toward journalists, claiming journalists lack credibility.  <br />            Through both a quantitative (survey) and qualitative (focus groups) methodology, this study contributes to the complex boundaries of the Lebanese media landscape that make the gap between media ethics education and real world pressures in need of sustained analysis. To that end, this research study aims to explore the challenges media ethics education in Lebanon faces, along with the perceptions formed by media students about journalistic practices and the application of moral reasoning in the field. In addition, the study investigates whether media ethics courses prepare students for settling moral dilemmas in the professional arena.  In order to address the multiple factors affecting ethics education, it is significant to understand the relationship between journalists and power, democratic norms, technological change, global community, and academic critiques.<br />            Survey and focus groups results indicated that the majority of students rated moral reasoning as important for their future media professions, and that the media ethics course prepares them for professional life.  On the other hand, the majority believe that the corrupt system in Lebanon makes journalists resort to unethical practices which in turn compromise journalists’ credibility and integrity.  Students consider that journalists have power as the so-called fourth estate, yet that power seems minimal when journalists lack the freedom to write facts without fear from editors and/or gatekeepers' political views, technological advancements, economic pressure and on-the-job demands, placing journalistic integrity again at stake. <br /> <br /> <br />Keywords: Ethics Education, Journalistic Practices, Lebanon\n","Abstract Body: This study aimed to investigate which cues people may use to differentiate fake news and real news.

As members of the public lose trust and interest in the media, some outlets are turning to forms of reporting like constructive/solutions journalism to provide a greater context to news consumers. Our survey shows that the American public values such reporting, and even places its functions above many of the others traditionally assigned to journalism.\n","Abstract Body: Public service media (PSM) have played an important and uncontested role in the provision of news and information in many European countries for decades. They have traditionally been required to fulfil public service obligations like universality and diversity in access and coverage, as well as high-quality national programs grounded in an independent, impartial, and accountable approach. Today, however, they are confronted with numerous internal and external challenges, organizationally, economically and politically. Against this background, this study examines for three purposely selected countries the audience perspective on the topic. It analyzes the use, evaluation of and attitudes towards the performance of PSM for news by the population in relation to demographic characteristics. The aim is to identify what relevance the public attributes to PSM news in the digital age and how they see PSMs’ role in comparison to other and partly new (digital) media news offerings.Anonline survey was conducted in Germany, France and the United Kingdom. Overall, the findings show that respondents attribute a clear role to PSM and clearly distinguish it from other media offerings for news in an increasingly digital media environment. They rate the information quality offered by PSM higher than that of most other media offerings. Entertaining aspects, on the other hand, were more likely to be attributed to social media platforms. Furthermore, the findings show clear differences in the evaluation of PSM depending on media use, political interest and populist attitudes as well as on demographic variables.\n","Abstract Body: This article analyzes the relationship between journalists’ role conceptions and expectations of journalism on the part of the population. We theoretically model this interrelation as part of the reflexive relationship between journalism and audiences, which is characterized by mutual (self-)expectations that can be more or less congruent. Through a representative CATI-survey (n=1,000) we explore the tasks German citizens expect journalists to fulfil and then compare them with existing representative data on German journalists’ own role conceptions as collected in the “Worlds of Journalism” study (Steindl et al. 2017). The core of our questionnaire is the internationally accepted item battery on journalistic role conceptions which we adapted for the audience’s perspective and complemented with potential new journalistic tasks such as hosting and moderating public discourse online. Results show that the journalism-audience relationship in Germany is characterized by a comparatively high degree of congruence. What journalists want to do most is also what they ought to do most in the eyes of the population: these are primarily traditional journalistic tasks of objective reporting as well as presentations of analysis and explanation; the promotion of tolerance and cultural diversity was also rated as comparatively important by both samples. Looking more closely at citizens shows that, overall, they considermore journalistic tasks important than journalists do themselves and that expectations of journalism show significant correlations, especially with news usage practices.\n",null,"Abstract Body: In most African countries, “fake news”, politically-motivated disinformation campaigns, and, more generally, the presence of misinformation in the media were a common occurrence long before these became a preoccupation in the Global North in recent years. However, with a fast-growing population of social media users, and the popularization of mobile communication tools such as WhatsApp, misinformation appears to have become much more pervasive across the continent. Research in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa has shown that its citizens have much higher levels of perceived exposure to false information, and are more likely to share made up news than US citizens. Building on the latter, this paper explores the motivations and contributing factors to sharing misinformation in the continent. Our analysis of seven focus groups with university students in four Sub-Saharan African countries, shows two prevailing motivations, civic duty and fun. Sharing of political misinformation was uncommon in our sample, as students appeared to be uninterested in politics, but most said friends and relatives with stronger political affiliations were active sharers. We also show that students use an array of cues to determine credibility, which often, but not always, determines the shareability of a piece of information.\n","Abstract Body: A growing number of hyper-partisan alternative media outlets have sprung up online to challenge mainstream journalism. However, research on news sharing in this particular media environment is lacking. Based on the virality of sixteen partisan outlets’ coverages of immigration and using the latest computational linguistic algorithm (e.g., Distributed Dictionary Representation algorithms), the present study probes how hyper-partisan news sharing is related to <i>source transparency<\/i>, <i>content styles and moral framing<\/i>. The study finds that the most shared articles reveal author names and photos, but not necessarily other types of author information. The study uncovers a salient link between moral frames and virality of hyper-partisan news. In particular, audiences of the partisan media are more likely swayed by moral frames that emphasize <i>authority/respect<\/i> and <i>purity/<\/i><i> sanctity<\/i>, while the moral frame invoking <i>fairness/reciprocity<\/i> relates to a lesser degree of virality.  <br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This paper sets out to develop a theoretical and methodological framework addressing journalists’ safety in a comparative perspective. Such an approach would move the analysis beyond descriptive diagnostics for specific countries. For this reason, we propose an integrative framework to the study of journalists’ safety. Such an approach is needed as freedom of expression as a fundamental human right is severely imperilled through countless attacks on journalists around the world.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Digital platforms have become major gateways to news. While it is well established that perceptions of trust in news found on social media or via search engines are lower than traditional news media, there has been less discussion about the impact of social media use on trust in news more broadly. This study fills that gap by examining the influence of digital platforms as news sources and pathways on perceptions of mistrust in news at a country level through a secondary analysis of data from 26 countries surveyed by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (2016; 2019). An increase in social media use for accessing news resulted in an increase in mistrust in news media generally. Higher levels of mistrust were related to an increased sharing of news. Based on these findings, this paper argues the use of digital platforms for news is closely linked to growing mistrust in news.\n","Abstract Body: Through a combination of ethnography of communication and contextualization cues, this study examines naturally occurring discourse and interviews in Bulgaria and illustrates how participants interactionally construct a cultural notion of the “others” in order to make sense of the country’s transitional context. The data is examined for the use of contextualization cues and communication symbols, which the participants creatively use to position themselves and others in relation to a corrupt “other.”  The study shows how the participants creatively utilize both local contextualization cues as well as larger historical symbols and their meanings in order to frame both their interactional moves and create a political stance for themselves within the country’s post-socialist present.  The larger cultural symbols and their meanings evoked within the interaction as a post-socialist context are examined on a macro (local myths) and micro (symbol use) level.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This essay seeks to expand theoretical applications of Galvin’s (2006) discourse dependence, with a particular focus on embracing both the critical and discourse-analytic aspects of the concept. Through an examination of the discourses of trans family members about explaining who and how their families are, a critical discourse dependency theory is developed that both illuminates and explains the experiences of trans families but that could also be applied and developed in multiple other contexts.\n","Abstract Body: I examine the relationship between membership categories and culture through analyzing how refugees negotiate the “refugee” category during narrative performances at a local Refugee Speakers’ Bureau event. Drawing from ethnomethdological and ethnography of communication approaches, I illustrate how the way participants negotiate the membership category “refugee” indexes current, interactionally specific knowledge and broader, symbolic cultural meanings. On an interactional level, participants expand membership categories for person referencing through replacing the “refugee” category with other, locally relevant categories (i.e., “community”, “newcomer”). Participants expand meanings surrounding refugee identity through category bound activities and category tied predicates (i.e., refugees “share stories” and “feel invisible”). A close analysis of membership categories suggests cultural premises for this speech community, including valuing sharing stories, valuing expressing (negative) emotions, valuing ethnic diversity, and valuing speaking as an individual and as a representative for community members. I conclude by discussing how understanding interactional and cultural dimensions of membership categories provides insight into ways membership categories can be used to create space for an otherwise marginalized community.\n","Abstract Body: In this paper, I describe instances in which participants in naturally occurring interaction use their views of appropriate conduct to mark boundaries of speech communities. Using the ethnography of communication as the framework and speech code as the key concept, I analyze ordinary conversations in English between English speakers and Japanese speakers. In the conversations, the participants describe their experiences in observing the actions that fall outside their views of appropriateness and attribute these actions to cultural differences. In doing so, they display their views of appropriate communication conduct and use them to exclude the actions that belong outside their views of the boundary of the speech community with which they identify. The study hopes to contribute to the ethnography of communication research by illustrating how participants in talk-in-interaction use their views of codes to draw boundaries of speech communities and offering a case in which naturally occurring interaction is used as data for analysis.\n","Abstract Body: For this preliminary case study, I use ethnography of communication to investigate discursive practices of performing Basque pride in the Facebook group called <i>Basques in Idaho and Elsewhere. <\/i>Basques living outside of the homeland (Northern Spain and Southern France) are considered a diasporic community (Ordiazabal, 2011; Urla, 2012), and I focus on those living in the United States who participate in social clubs and online communities built around shared identity. I conceptualize these U.S. Basques as a speech community (Morgan, 2014) that values expressions of cultural pride and engages it in specific ways. I propose the term <i>pride work <\/i>as a particular kind of identity work that functions to 1) perform membership to a collective, 2) negotiate ideal stances and practices of that collective, and thus 3) define the group in relation to other social categories. The goals of using this term are to conceptualize pride as discursive practice and not just an emotion, to recognize it as a prominent and distinct component of Basque identity expression, and to emphasize its potentiality more broadly as a communication strategy for constructing and maintaining diasporic collective identities. In this case, users of the Facebook group perform membership in two main ways: credentialing themselves as Basque by blood (<i>being <\/i>Basque) and by practice (<i>doing <\/i>Basque). This illuminates overlapping and sometimes contradictory understandings of what it means to be authentically Basque.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Online spaces foster a new type of connectivity that affords multi-territorial engagements. Providing opportunities for grassroots activism, online media have reconstituted the ways in which diasporas – transnational communities living outside of their countries of origin – mobilize around issues of local and global significance. In this study, we explore hyperlinking behaviours among the Ukrainian Canadian communities on Facebook. Mapping the geographic and linguistic boundaries of the Ukrainian national web, we identify distinct web spheres that mediate the Ukrainian Canadians’ relationship to their country of origin. We find that, while most groups share news in Ukrainian, English, and, to a lesser extent, Russian, the information about local businesses, events, and fundraisers is disproportionately shared in the English language. We argue these sharing practices serve a twofold purpose: to mobilize Canadian Ukrainians around the events happening in their homeland and articulate a Ukrainian identity through sharing Ukrainian culture among their local communities.\n","Abstract Body: We consider online interactions among diasporic Portuguese in France and nonmigrant Portuguese. More specifically, by focusing on interactions surrounding a controversial vlog post by well-known Franco-Portuguese vlogger, Jonathan Da Silva (JDS) about summer return trips of diasporic Portuguese in France to Portugal, we discuss the utility of the notion of <i>addressivity <\/i>to capture how participants orient and respond to the vlog post, its performer, and differently situated commenters. Specifically, JDS’ post and follow-up commenters address an audience of fellow diasporic Portuguese as well as nonmigrant Portuguese viewers, addressing their discourse to members of one or both categories. Participants do not only address one another as <i>specific individuals<\/i> who live across national borders, but address their contributions <i>to generic or collective social types<\/i>, treating the online interaction as a way to engage with <i>all<\/i> diasporic and nonmigrant Portuguese. As such, participants do not only orient to Portugal and France as places, but as types of collectivized groups of interlocutors, associated with places and trajectories. We then discuss how the online setting encourages participants to hail others and themselves as essentialized tokens of larger diasporic and nonmigrant Portuguese social types.<br />\n","Abstract Body: In this extended abstract, we use grounded practical theory to develop a practical theory for using ‘difficult data’-- data that contains language and ideologies that could be offensive, bigoted, or otherwise disturbing to students-- in language and social interaction classes.

We begin by relating GPT to frequently used ways to categorize social science approaches, dividing them by whether they are post-positivist, interpretive, critical, or postmodern. Then we take a close look at approaches to inquiry that share the most in common with GPT, showing for each how it is similar yet different from GPT. A key commitment of GPT is to be grounded. Thus, our first comparison is with other grounded approaches, including grounded theory as developed by Glaser and Strauss, ethnography as it initially flourished in anthropology, and discourse tracing, a relatively new method) A second commitment of GPT is to link close study of the empirical world with normative proposals. We compare GPT to other approaches that share this commitment including cultural-historical activity theory, which grew out of Lev Vygotsky’s ideas, design theory, and a diverse family of action research approaches. A final distinctive aspect of GPT was its initial sense of itself as a language-discourse-interaction approach. In this last part of the paper, we compare GPT with five LSI approaches.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: 1. Introduction<br />Linguistic research has overlooked the rhetorical effect of attitudinal meanings on the incitee despite recognition by scholars in the legal field (e.g., Bayefsky & Blank, 2018; Cotler & Grossman, 2009; Gordon, 2018) of these meanings’ influence on audiences’ actions. This paper contributes to the study of open communication, particularly public statements, as used by extremists in the context of incitement to violent acts against out-groups. It addresses an under-searched topic: incitement by means of interpersonal, attitudinal meaning making, namely stance construction and enactment of social affiliation. Stance is here considered to be an \"\"intersubjective activity\"\" (Haddington, 2006, pp. 73-74).  The aim of this paper is to argue for <i>incitement<\/i> as intersubjective, affiliative practice, and how the attitudinal meaning-making resources are used intersubjectively to prompt actions and urge the ideal audiences to act violently against certain social groups/actors. It seeks to identify the types of rhetorical strategies used in public incitement in a publicly available text excerpted from ‘The Great Replacement’ manifesto (which was released prior to Christchurch, New Zealand, attack on 15 March 2019), drawing on the <i>Appraisal framework<\/i> (Martin & White, 2005) and <i>affiliation theory<\/i> as developed by Knight (2008, 2010), Martin (2010) and Zappavigna and Martin (2018).<br />We focus on the interpersonal meanings (in incitement), where language is viewed as “the mediator of role”, including what may be understood by all forms of enacted relationships and interplay with audiences, and the expression of feelings (Halliday, 1973, p. 66). The concept of incitement can be tracked in Roget’s 21<sup>st<\/sup> Century Thesaurus (2005) which informs us that incitement is of ‘compelling’ and 'cause to happen' type of concept, a thing shared with, e.g., instigation, motivation, prompting and stimulation. To incite is “to arouse to action that is unlawful and possibly violent”, and in criminal law it is \"\"to instigate, persuade, or move another to commit a crime” (Black’s Law Dictionary, online). In the context of terrorism, incitement is a “public provocation to commit a terrorist offense” (Gordon, 2018, p. 5), and an “encouragement to commit acts of terrorism” (Jaconelli, 2018, p. 247). It is a “an attempted crime\"\" which involves “a communication that is made with a view to persuading the addressee(s) to commit an offence” (Jaconelli, 2018, p. 245). Obviously, definitions highlight the influence of language used in incitement. Language arouses, persuades, instigates and moves. As such, rhetorical strategies of persuasion and positioning of the audiences are paramount.<br />Discourse analysis studies of the discursive realisation of incitement are very limited. Existing literature mainly belongs to critical discourse analysis and the field of Pragmatics. Zghayyir (2016) studies the persuasion strategies of Al-Qaeda's Osama bin Laden and Liberation Tiger Tamil Eelam' s (LTTE) Velupillai Prabhakaran’ discourse as used to encourage followers to commit terrorist attacks. She analysed five speeches by each leader following van Dijks’ (1980, 1998) <i>semantic macrostructures<\/i> framework and <i>ideological square<\/i> along with Wodak’s (2001, 2009) Discourse-Historical approach. Both speakers predominantly use negative and positive lexical items. Similar findings exist in Al-Saaidi's (2017) analysis of one speech by bin Laden. These studies, however, have not investigated the interaction between negative lexical items and the experiences being evaluated, given that this interaction is likely to produce new meanings (cf. Kniffka, 2007; Liu & Hood, 2019).<br />Kurzon (1998) argues that for the incitement crime to happen, there must be an incited person who even could be “defined vaguely as the general public or as a random section of the public” (Kurzon, 1998, p. 590). I argue that this vaguely defined incitee in extremist communication are the 'ideal' audiences (cf. Fairclough, 2001) to whom the inciter brings interpersonal meanings with specific experiences relevant to the audiences who will make the right inference (Fairclough, 2001, p. 153) and understand the messages from group ideology’s perspective (Seals, 2012, p. 238). Kurzon (1998) states that in order to incite, the inciter may use forms such as the imperative form (e.g., ‘Let's overthrow the government’) a form of request, suggestion, promise, etc. (e.g., ‘You should kill that cop’) or a series of utterances or statements used to build an argument, persuasion and/or inducement, and whose accumulative effect produces incitement. The imperative and hortative forms are emphasised by Culpeper, Iganski and Sweiry (2017).<br />Apparently linguistic studies have not accounted for the attitudinal meanings’ socially positioning, affiliative and thus inciting function, which we argue that it is a main area of interest of authors of extremist public statements. Authors strategically select their choices of the expression of ideas, choice of sentiments, and word selection of the text in alignment with the (organisational) reference beliefs and ideology prior to its release (Goffman, 1981; Love, 2002). Therefore, different linguistic strategies can be employed by authors in an attempt to <i>persuade<\/i> receivers of an ideology or an act (De Saussure & Schulz, 2005). This is particularly the case when a choice is intentional on the part of the writer (van Eemeren, 2005, p. xi) “to induce into error” (Rigotti, 2005, p. 69) or to have the receiver adopt a behaviour consistent with the author’s interest (De Saussure, 2005, p. 119). In response to the identified gap in the reviewed literature, we introduce a discourse analysis approach to incitement as intersubjective, affiliative practice, while considering verbal communication to be of a ‘dialogic’ nature, i.e. “it responds to something, affirms something, anticipates possible responses and objections, seeks support, and so on” (Vološinov, 1995, p. 139 cited in White 2003, p. 261).  The main question of this paper is:<br />What are the rhetorical strategies employed to affiliate ideal audiences with the author’s social group, and to disaffiliate from (the would be) victims, providing a warrant for hostility and justification for violence?<br />2. Method<br />This paper proposes the Appraisal framework (particularly the Attitude system) (Martin & White, 2005), and <i>affiliation theory<\/i> as developed by Knight (2008, 2010), Martin (2010), Martin and Zappavigna (2013), Zappavigna and Martin (2018). These tools afford analysis of options in attitudinal meaning-making, value construction, and strategic actions in social affiliation at increasing levels of delicacy. These tools can illuminate the nuances in interpersonal meaning-making in the practice of incitement, which is key to a fuller understanding of public incitement.<br />The Attitude system is used to investigate types of attitudinal meanings and values construed. It encompasses three semantic regions traditionally referred to as emotion, ethics, and aesthetics (Martin & White, 2005):<br /><i>affect<\/i> which is concerned with <i>emotional reactions<\/i> to an ideational trigger (i.e. experience) and has the sub-categories of (un)happiness, (in)security, (dis)inclination and (dis)satisfaction;<br /><i>judgement<\/i> which relates to evaluations of <i>behaviour<\/i>, reflecting how we should behave, and involves values of social esteem (i.e. <i>normality<\/i>, <i>capacity<\/i> and <i>tenacity<\/i>) and social sanction (i.e. <i>veracity<\/i> and <i>propriety<\/i>); and<br /><i>appreciation<\/i> which is concerned with proposed criteria of value of <i>things<\/i> and <i>events<\/i> and includes values of <i>reaction<\/i>, <i>composition<\/i> and <i>valuation<\/i>.<br />Evaluations, as such, reflect an author’s/organisation’s worldview and how the world ought to be (White, 2006). Meanwhile, the broader worldview provides the foundation for endorsing social values/bonds (cf. Wignell, Tan & O’Halloran, 2017, p. 3) which are rallied for in order to be upheld and, thus, forming the foundation for social/action networks to which certain actions appeal to values viewed by the author/organisation as being endangered (cf. Atran, 2011, 2015).<br />Concerning affiliation theory, Knight focuses on how social alignments around attitudinal meanings are forged. Knight’s model shows how the co-instantiation of both attitudinal meanings with the ideation works on attracting and repelling social networks by focusing on shared identity (Knight, 2010, p. 350). Through this co-instantiation, values are construed and realised (Knight, 2010). Affiliation can be achieved by such strategies as ‘communing’ and ‘condemning’ (Knight, 2010, p. 217). For Martin, affiliation models the “relationship between the reservoir of meanings in a culture and the repertoire a given individual can mobilize” (Martin, 2010, p. 23). In affiliation we “can conceive of persona [, that unite individual members,] aligning themselves into sub-cultures, configuring master identities [, e.g., class, ethnicity, religion, etc.,] and constituting a culture” (Martin, 2010, p. 24). By the means of evaluative/attitudinal meanings, the author<i> communes<\/i> with the ideal audiences since we usually do not express our feelings “unless we expect the person we are talking with to sympathize or empathize with us. We express feelings in order to share them … to build relationships” or, otherwise, to create “a sense of alienation” (Martin, 2002, p. 196). With values as all-pervading feature of language (Thompson & Alba-Jues, 2014, p. 5) and attitudinal meanings constituting “four-fifths” of a text (making it centred around promoting, establishing and maintaining “communion of feelings”) (Firth, 1964, p. 112), ideal audiences are positioned to respond to co-instantiated meanings as “active participators in the creation and maintenance of cultural values” (Firth, 1957, p. 186).<br />Zappavigna and Martin (2018) have identified <i>communing affiliation<\/i> strategies, viewing affiliation as being concerned with alignment to the co-instantiated meanings (Han, 2015, p. 30). These strategies are (Zappavigna & Martin, 2018, p. 8):<br /><i>Convoking<\/i>, the author proposes co-instantiated meanings to a particular community in an attempt to <i>call<\/i> them together to bond around these meanings;<br /><i>Promoting<\/i>, the author interpersonally emphasises co-instantiated meanings via <i>graduation<\/i> (e.g. superlatives); and<br /><i>Finessing<\/i>, the author modulates the co-instantiated meanings (and thus stances construed)in relation to other potential meanings(and, thus, stances) through, e.g., negation.<br />The text is analysed as in four main stages. First, co-instantiated meanings in the text will be annotated following Martin, Zappavigna, Dwyer and Cléirigh's (2013) style, [ideation: <<>>/attitude: <<>>], which allows for in-text annotation; yet, the subtype of attitude will be added in brackets, e.g., [ideation: <<>>/attitude: <<>> (-propriety)]. For example, ‘This Pakistani Muslim invader [Sadiq Khan] now sits as representative for the people of London’ will be annotated as follow: [ideation: Sadiq Khan/attitude: negative judgement (negative propriety)]. ‘The Pakistani Muslim invader is the ideation (attitudinally targeted element), while ‘now sits as representative for the people of London’ communicates the attitudinal meanings, i.e. provoked negative judgement (namely, lack of propriety)achieved via factual material that has the potential to trigger reaction in the audiences by virtue of being presented in the text (cf. White, 2006). This co-instantiation not only construes stance, but also rhetorically and (ultimately) ideologically positions the ideal audiences (White, 2006, pp. 37-38) and invoke in them more or less warrantable stances to take up or respond to (Harré & van Langenhove, 1991 cited in Tann, 2010, p. 173; Macken-Horarik & Isaac, 2014, p. 68; White, 2006, p. 40).<br />Second, a hierarchy of values instantiated in the text will be tabulated. Each proposition/sentence that involves values will be arranged in turn. Then, next to each, the construed <i>epitomised<\/i>(i.e. auxiliary)<i>values<\/i> and <i>activated master values<\/i> will be provided. The evaluative co-instantiations provide the entry point to the social action of (dis)affiliating (Knight, 2010, p. 250). In relation to the previous example, the <i>epitomised<\/i> value is ‘condemnation of Pakistani Muslim to be a mayor of London’, while the <i>activated master value<\/i> around which the ideal audiences are rhetorically positioned and aligned is ‘Christian Europe’.<br />Third, instances of affiliation, through alignment to the co-instantiated meanings, are categorised into the following strategies that embody intersubjective strategic actions to which the ideal audiences would respond or favour:<br />condemning strategy, or<br />communing strategy which could be:<br />convoking,<br />promoting, or<br />finessing<br />Strategies will be discussed as macro rhetorical strategies of incitement which employ the following micro-rhetorical strategies (see White, 2006):<br />positioning the ideal audiences via explicit or implicit attitudinal meanings;<br />representation of ideations/participants as agentive or affected which has a potential to influence who is to be seen as more blameworthy and, thus, to position the audiences to blame them.<br />Since in affiliation we are concerned about framing (Martin, 2010, p. 24), I argue that through co-instantiated meanings, extremists can achieve “diagnostic”, “prognostic” and “motivational” framing (Benford & Snow, 2000, p. 615), creating social and action network with ideological justification of violence, and inviting ideal audiences to respond to the meanings.<br />3. Key results<br />Results show the use of attitudinal meanings in every single sentence of the excerpted text. Co-instantiation is found predominantly judgemental in nature, with epitomised values that are chiefly of negative propriety type that amounts to around 78% of the instances in the text. The activated master values are: racial, ethnic, religious, and national values. ‘Condemning’ (dis)affiliation is employed far more than ‘communing’ affiliation. 'Promoting' was found both in condemning and communing  strategies. Condemning is realised when the author expresses his rejection of unshareable value that violates the author-ideal audience's shared master value. Condemning is, therefore, chiefly operating by the author’s de-alignment with the negatively, attitudinal target while simultaneously (rhetorically) disaffiliating the ideal audiences from the target's values which are, thus, represented as threatening, providing a warrant for violence.<br />The in-group violated master values are offered for ideal audiences as something to rally around as a membership symbol which they ought to seek to preserve or maintain. By means of this condemning which makes use of the micro-rhetorical strategies (primarily, positioning via explicit attitudinal meanings), the ideal audiences are ultimately ideologically positioned to disfavour the target's values and how the world is, based on their frame of reference and ideological view of how the world ought to be. The ideal audiences' response to this social process of (dis)affiliation is potentially built through the text with framing lens. In the example given earlier, the mayor by being represented as of unshareable (or opposing) values, he is considered to be responsible and blamed for the highlighted political situation, and thus identifying him and his social group as enemies, justifying engaging in violence against them. As such, this disaffiliation is of 'diagnostic' framing function in the sense that it is centred around source of problem-identification (which is here the value upheld) and, thus, meanings of social sanction parameters such as social (in)justice, (il)legality, victimisation, and who is to blame. It is also of 'motivational' framing function as well, since it focuses on the 'why' to address the situation (which is the violation of shared values) and the rational for engaging in the necessary corrective action. The same is found in, e.g., \"\"Sadiq Khan [... is] an open sign of the disenfranchisement and ethnic replacement of the British people in the British Isles\"\", [ideation: Sadiq Khan/ attitude: negative judgement (negative propriety)], which includes attitudinal meaning-making resources of social propriety or duty.<br />Through author-ideal audiences 'promoting communing' affiliation, the author supplies, for example, \"\"What better sign of the white rebirth than the removal of this invader\"\". In this instance, the author offers the co-instantiated meanings, [ideation: the removal of Sadiq Khan/ attitude: positive appreciation (positive valuation)], with the epitomised value of non-white invading the white, and the then activated shared master value- 'white race'. He interpersonally emphasises the co-instantiated meanings via \"\"better\"\", emphasising on attitudinal meanings concerning what needs be done to address the situation, i.e. the 'prognostic' framing function, wherein the author represents the removal of Sadiq Khan as a positive thing, proposing a solution to the (value violation) problem.<br />4. Conclusion<br />This paper shows an example of communication that is laden with representation of opposing or competing values which are used strategically as resources to validate the in-group repositioning or remedial action. The enacted (dis)affiliation strategies not only provide the foundation for “reasonable hostility” (Tracy, 2008), but also diagnose, motivate and propose actions- making the practice of incitement inherently evaluative/attitudinal phenomenon. This paper proposes a new taxonomy for strategies of 'disaffiliation' used in incitement which builds upon the negatively attitudinal meaning-making towards out-group(s) (members), who are represented as an ideological risk or of perceived breach to a certain set of social values.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper will explore the feasibility of decolonizing Grounded Practical Theory.

The history of the discipline shows that its definition has always been the subject of disagreements. If the overall course of a session always follows the same steps, the nature and causes of the phenomenon remain unclear. Several elements nevertheless seem to point at the role played by the hypnotist’s status. Although some practitioners have reflected on the question of authority, researchers have given it only minimal attention and their approach of authority was rather static.<br />Therefore, we looked at the issue using the communicative constitution of organization approach (CCO). This approach gives us a more dynamic angle of the phenomenon. Authority can be evoked through effects of presentification and ventriloquism, that is, the staging of authority figures in discourse.<br />We first observe the practice of street hypnosis, a playful activity involving people who do not know each other, from an ethnomethodological perspective. We have thus studied the ways in which authority was claimed and negotiated by the hypnotist and the ways in which his subject conceded to him. Three great figures emerged from our observations, figures that rely on a notion of authority based on knowledge or the ability to anticipate events. In the context of street hypnosis, these figures have proved to be powerful enough that the vast majority of subjects do not negotiate further the authority of the hypnotist.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines YouTube videos about the ‘Momo Challenge’, a viral internet hoax. A Systemic Functional Linguistics approach is undertaken. This approach involves analysing the transcripts and visual content of YouTube videos, in order to understand the macro-genres of deceptive communication that exist on YouTube and the genre stages that constitute each macro-genre. The comment sections of each video are also analysed to discover if moral panics are linked to the spread of deceptive information.\n","Abstract Body: Given the unique linguistic representation of Chinese rap battles, the present study conducts a pragmalinguistic analysis of how Chinese emcees (MCs) strategically employ impoliteness strategies to win in rap battles and its underlying mechanisms. By examining the impoliteness strategy uses in <i>Iron Mic<\/i>, the most well-known Chinese underground freestyle rap battle, researchers compared the performances of advanced and novice rappers. 18 online videos with 51 rounds (i.e., 999 lines) were collected and coded drawing on Culpeper’s taxonomy of impoliteness. Results showed that advanced rappers used impoliteness less frequently, more explicitly (e.g., bragging a higher moral ground), and in wider themes. This study explores this traditionally marginalized underground culture, and hopes to contribute to impoliteness studies by providing novel linguistics evidence and identifying underlying norms of situationally appropriate impoliteness.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Parental involvement in their children’s education and schools is crucial to student success. The data presented in this paper (is part of a larger project) examined how involved refugee parents were with their children’s educational processes and schools in South-East Queensland, Australia. Forty-seven refugee parents from three county groups namely Ethiopia, Congo and Burma volunteered to be interviewed. We found that lack of English language proficiency proved to be a huge barrier in establishing any social interaction with native English speakers within the school domain. Some participants refrained from going to the School, or meeting teachers etc. due to language competency issues. This also reduced any potential of interacting with parents of other children (i.e., not from their own country group).\n","Abstract Body: This paper employs linguistic anthropology to argue that Trump’s campaign language indexes prosperity ideologies, which is only heightened by his physical embodiment of the prosperity gospel as a healthy billionaire gesturing in ways possibly reminiscent of televised prosperity preachers. Building off of the connections Trump has to prosperity preachers, such as Paula White (who prayed at the inauguration), this paper finds his finds that his campagin speeches are within the register of the prosperity gospel, touching upon the four tenants of faith, wealth, health, and victory. Trump's embodied practice of prosperity gospel gestures, however, are minimal. This examination of Trump's campaign language aids in improving understanding of America's current political and religious landscape.\n","Abstract Body: (extended abstract)\n","Abstract Body: Incivility has received more research attention to uncovering its function in the online context. However, few studies have explored how online swearing, a traditional masculine language habit, could contribute to women’s potential for constructing their emotional identification with others. Using the case of Chinese female netizens’ swearing on Weibo, a Twitter-style networking platform in China, this study probes into catharsis, aggression and social connection functions of swearing and how they link to emotion and linguistic contexts via content analysis and discourse-historical approach. Our preliminary findings show there are relatively more individualized expressions instead of social interaction reflected on Chinese female swearing. Chinese women identify themselves as female losers with dual powerlessness facing stagnant social mobility and patriarchal social structure.\n","Abstract Body: This extended abstract uses conversation analysis primarily to examine conspicuous lapses found in 57 peer support calls.  These particular lapses occur in third position after question-answer and formulation-decision adjacency pairs.  While prior research views such lapses as implicating sequence completion, these lapses signal an incomplete sequence, and treat both minimal and dispreferred second pair parts as accountable and insufficient.  An institutional orientation to letting callers talk may explain this phenomenon.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Shared Laughter at Multicultural Workplace Conflictual Interactions<br /><br />Background<br /><br />This paper explores the role of shared laughter, as a strategic and collaborative relational action, in intercultural conflictual workplace meetings. Laughter is primarily and fundamentally social (Glenn, 2003; Warner-Garcia, 2014; Provine, 2016). The social interactional approach to laughter (Glenn, 2003) allows us to see laughter not solely as a behaviour, but as a social communicative action. Whether the participants laugh, who laughs, at what, when, how, and for how long, are all important aspects of laughter as a social action influenced by social and cultural factors (ibid: 163). Drawing on the data of an ethnographic case study of conflict communication in a multicultural Chinese workplace in Beijing, this paper examines the functions of shared laughter in relation to the dynamic evolvement of interactive tension at one of the most conflictual meetings. The investigation aims to answer the following question: <i>when people laugh, especially frequently laugh together at a conflictual meeting, what are they doing or trying to do?<\/i><br />Research on laughter in conflictual interactions is extremely scarce except for a few that examine the functions of a relevant activity, humour, in conflict talk in general (e.g. Norrick & Spitz, 2008). In fact, studies that focus on real-life conflictual interactions are very rare, probably due to ‘the difficulty in obtaining conflictual data from ordinary conversation or non-mediated workplace settings’ (Koester, 2018: 308).<br />Similarly, research on laughter as an action separate from humour in workplace meetings is also sparse. Most studies of laughter as an independent activity focus on the institutional contexts, which often involve lay-professional interactions in a relatively structured format, for example, medical (very often mental health) encounters (Haakana, 2001; Arminen & Halonen, 2007; Zayts & Schnurr, 2011; Dionigi & Canestrari, 2018), job interviews (Glenn, 2010, 2013) and political debates (Clayman, 1992). In co-worker interaction research, laughter is often treated as the same activity as humour or as a response to humour, which is mostly investigated as a resource for managing collegiality or constructing leadership in relation to power, politeness and culture (e.g. Holmes & Marra, 2002; Mullany, 2004; Holmes, 2006; Kangasharju & Nikko, 2009; Schnurr, 2009; Rogerson-Revell, 2011; Schnurr & Chan, 2011; Watson & Drew, 2017).<br />This paper contributes to the under-investigated area of laughter, especially laughing together, as a communicative action in workplace conflictual interactions. Data analysis indicates that shared laughter may be deployed to serve different relational functions at different stages of the conflictual interactions. The examination of seven extracts of meeting transcript below will demonstrate<br />how shared laughter can be used to attack others as the interactional conflicts escalate;<br />and how the participants create chances for laughing together, even when there is no evident humorous attempt, by collectively establishing, converting and re-invoking ‘safe’ laughables, in order to ameliorate the tension and to achieve reconciliation.<br /><br />Theoretical Orientation<br /><br /><i>Shared laughter<\/i>, or ‘laughing together’, is an activity in its own right (Jefferson et al., 1987: 158). Earlier Conversation Analysis (CA) researchers (Jefferson et al., 1977, 1987; Glenn, 2003) observe that shared laughter is not necessarily achieved by laughing in unison, but via various methodical and coordinated sequential processes. It is usually initiated by one participant (often the current speaker but not necessarily so) beginning to laugh and other(s) joining in. The first laugh serves as the invitation for laughing together as a coordinated sequential event.<br /><br />Laughter often orients to and indexes a referent, termed by Glenn (2003) as <i>laughable<\/i>, which is often located in the linguistic or non-linguistic action immediately before or after the laughter, or simultaneous as the laughter. Laughable may not be intentionally designed by the producer. It can be the accomplishment of joint negotiation and construction of the participants during the interactions. An action or utterance that is not intended as humorous may be retrospectively converted to a laughable by the participants, very often for relational purpose (Glenn, 2003; Markaki et al., 2010; Warner-Garcia, 2014). The data analysis in this paper will show how laughable is locally and collectively established and then re-invoked constantly by the participants for the purpose of mitigating the interactive tension. It is also argued that the relational assessment of a laughable plays a crucial role in the participants’ decision of joining in, or not, an instance of shared laughter during conflictual workplace interactions.<br /><br />The functions of (shared) laughter in social interactions are relational rather than referential. In other words, laughter deals with the meaning at the interpersonal rather than content level. Shared laughter in particular can display the laughers’ alignment towards the laughable referent, the relevant participants, as well as the ongoing interactive process (Adelswärd & Öberg, 1998: 426; Glenn, 2003: 160). In problematic or conflictual situations, such interactively achieved relational meaning may serve to cause or remedy offence, and as a result to aggravate or mitigate the tension. The fact that the interactants constantly resort to laughter as an effective relational device in conversational trouble may be attributable to its ambiguous and implicit nature. This paper will examine a range of different relational functions of shared laughter in different stages of the conflictual process, including the mitigation, modification, time-out, attack and reconciliation functions.<br /><br />Data<br /><br />The seven extracts analyzed in this paper are taken from a severely conflictual workplace meeting, which is part of the dataset of an ethnographic case study of a multicultural organization in Beijing. This dataset consists of audio recordings of meetings (about 35 hours), participant interviews (about 10 hours), organizational documents, emails, field observation notes, etc. collected during a three-month conflict communication process in the organization. There had been continuous conflicts and confrontation between the Chinese and expatriate (North American) middle managers when the data collection started. The conflicts were mainly caused by differences in views of the organizational goals, professional and cultural values and practices, and styles of management and communication. In order to resolve the intercultural conflicts, the Chinese CEO took a series of measures including restructuring the management system and conflict resolution meetings. The meeting analysed in this paper is the first one of the conflict resolution meetings. Although the Chinese and expatriate managers prepared their problem talks carefully with an aim to improve the cooperative relationship, the interaction evolved gradually into severe conflicts. The seven examples in the analysis section are selected at the beginning, middle and end of the conflictual process. The analysis will focus on the functions of shared laughter in relation to the dynamic conflictual situation.<br /><br />Some parts of the extracts have been analyzed for a different research topic / question in my research monograph (published by Palgrave in 2015). However, the transcription of the extracts has been revised for this paper with a focus on the phenomenon of shared laughter.<br /><br />Findings<br /><br />It is argued that at highly conflictual workplace meetings, the participants make rational choices regarding whether or when to join a laugh and with whom, and that such choices may demonstrate or create speaker alignment in the conflictual interactions, which may in turn results in aggravating or mitigating the interactive tension. It is also found that in the course of conflictual meeting interactions, the participants seize every possible opportunity to create chances for laughing together, by establishing, converting and re-invoking laughables, in order to ameliorate the tension or achieve reconciliation.<br /><br />The examination of Extract 1 & 2 shows that shared laughter can be deployed as a resource for aligned attack in workplace conflictual interactions and that the participants’ decision of joining in such an instance of shared laughter as an attack indicate their awareness of the relational functions of shared laughter and their rational choices regarding participant alignment in the process of conflictual interactions.<br /><br />The analysis of Extract 3-6 demonstrates an interactive process in which the Chinese non-official speakers collectively establish and re-invoke whenever possible a laughable that is not related to the content of the speech, for example, a meta-discourse laughable, to create opportunities for laughing together in order to mitigate the tension without indicating their attitude towards the issues in dispute. Laughing together may enhance rapport and solidarity among the laughers. However, in the course of highly conflictual interactions, it is not easy to share a laugh without siding with one of the disputing sides, that is, to achieve ‘laughing with’ without ‘laughing at’, or to be affiliative without being disaffiliative. The participants at this meeting achieved this by establishing and re-invoking meta-discourse laughables. The analysis will demonstrate how a meta-discourse laughable is locally established at the emergence of tension (Extract 3), how this laughable is re-invoked later as the tension is aggravated (Extract 4 & 5) and how a similar meta-discourse laughable is invoked at the peak of conflict (Extract 6), and how laughing together by orienting to such meta-discourse laughables have contributed to the mitigation of tension.<br /><br />Extract 7 is taken from the end of the conflictual meeting, where shared laughter is deployed as an effective relational device in the collaborative process of achieving reconciliation. As a nonverbal strategy for rapport and solidarity, laughing together is actively deployed by the managers to express reassurance of undamaged relationship. It is also argued that shared laughter as a relational strategy can achieve what speech cannot achieve in such delicate situations. In a collective effort to achieve reconciliation, the ambiguity nature of laughter is made full use by the participants to express meanings inexplicitly, which are otherwise inappropriate to be expressed verbally considering the complexity of the conflictual interactive context.<br /><br />References:<br />Adelswärd, V., & Öberg, B.

Using conversation analysis and discursive psychology, we examine the interactional practices professionals use to signpost callers to external organisations when their community or neighbourhood concerns do not fit within the remit of the present service. Drawing on a corpus of over 420 calls and meetings at four different institutions (including mediation services, local council organisations, and a politician’s constituency office) in the UK, we show that and how the practice of signposting is typically bound up with the activities of <i>rejecting<\/i> the caller’s case for receiving service, but simultaneously <i>offering<\/i> a service – namely, a redirection to a more ostensibly appropriate service provider. We supplement and extend knowledge of institutional troubles talk and show how community problems can be treated as warranting assistance along a range of offer-ability (e.g., ‘I will do <i>X<\/i> for you’, ‘That’s the kind of thing we could do’, ‘Do you want their number?’). Significantly, troubles-tellings can be treated as requests for assistance as displayed through the mobilisation of offers. Our findings demonstrate practices for negotiating institutionality itself, through delimiting service remit, and through the orientations to the relevance of service provision as an institutional goal.  <br />\n","Abstract Body: Mobile phones are a ubiquitous feature of everyday life with which members and researchers of social interaction must occasionally contend (omitted). Whether one decries their presence (Turkle, 2015), challenges their blameworthiness in the alleged downfall of meaningful conversation (Ling, 2008), or shows how resourceful interactants can be with such devices (Licoppe, 2004), it is undeniable that mobile phones are available and often made relevant in interaction. Previous research has examined how they are attended to as communicative objects in the midst of co-present interaction (omitted) and how their content can be introduced to do social actions such as sharing epistemic access to assessables (omitted) or providing material and evidence for participants’ complaints, judgments, and identity constructions (omitted; omitted). In this abstract we analyze participants paraphrasing and ostensibly reading the text content from the screen of mobile phones as a resource for reporting (text) speech to co-present interlocutors in naturally-occurring conversation. In the results of our initial analysis, we show how examining this practice allows insights into how mobile phone content is introduced into conversations in sequentially-appropriate places to provide new information and invite co-participants into relevant next actions.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This article examines data collected from an online group linked to a community and Buddhist temple in rural Bhutan. The analysis unpacks how members used the technology to discursively co-construct mobile chronotopes, negotiating problems of time, space, and social hierarchy. A Buddhist appeasement ceremony to deities created a social situation for online members to discursively express both their appreciation and participation. We unpack how the space/time dilemma was negotiated through the use of images and language that indexed both traditional and novel forms.\n","Abstract Body: In this communication, I have used a CA-inspired approach to analyze the Tinder chat conversations of a sample of educated users in Paris. It is shown how such conversations display a distinctive sequential organization in which participants: a) design turns as a combination of backward-looking interactional moves (recognizably responsive to parts of previous messages) and forward-looking ones (often questions, and almost always moves designed as first pair parts of an adjacent sequence); b) orient towards providing significant elaborations of their moves, made noticeable by the way they seem to run against the “maxim of quantity”; c) the “one question after another” device, in which an open question is immediately repaired or reformulated (in the same message or in the next one) into a Y/N question. Participants are  accountable for not using such resources systematically. Since a recognizable function of such resources is to reinforce the way in which successive turns project an answer, their use display a concern that the conversation might stop, and the commitment of their users in keeping it going.  Tinder chat conversations thus seem haunted from the inside by the possibility of interactional desertion or ‘ghosting’.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Games are often described as a special mode of interaction in which the ordinary rules and expectations of everyday life are temporarily put on hold. Most game researchers have examined (and sometimes challenged) this ‘magic circle’ through engagement with the theory, or by asking gamers about it. But little research has examined how players themselves treat actions as being inside or outside of ‘the game’ during the course of their actual gameplay. This paper presents an inductive analysis of face-to-face gameplay interactions in order to theorize, from players’ perspectives, a typology of activities that are ‘outside’ the game, focusing on what are called ‘metagame’ activities. We use conversation analysis--a rigorous method for analysing interaction--to inspect the detailed, embodied ways in which gamers switch between activities in the interactive context of tabletop board games. We show how players orient to the game’s ongoing progress while managing other concurrent activities.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper presents a view of interaction analysis that departs from the intersubjectivist assumptions that underlie its ethnomethodological tradition. Adopting a pragmatist perspective, we propose to treat every phenomenon as being composed of relations, that is, as being constituted by passing through various things and beings. Extending Latour’s work on modernity, we argue that interaction analysts aim to capture social phenomena at the junction between two modes of existence, that is, two manners of passing through others. In the mode of subsistence, social phenomena are (re)produced by passing through continuously new elements. In the mode of reference, social phenomena maintain themselves by going back and forth between various inscriptions. Drawing upon a case study, we show how the movement of subsistence always eludes that of reference, and how analysts can only move along with this movement by limiting their corroboration techniques, both in number and in range.\n","Abstract Body: Many critical discourse analysis (CDA) scholars present the idea of “democracy” as a normative yardstick against which injustices and inequalities of all kinds and in any type of society can be measured; many also assume there is an inherent opposition between democratization with its advances toward social justice and neoliberal marketization with its array of negative consequences. As this paper argues, the issue is more complicated than such a dualistic framing suggests: The advent of neoliberal marketization with its socially harmful outcomes has gone hand-in-hand with the discourse of universal democratization. Since it at least partially sanctions the global neoliberal order, democratization discourse applied uncritically to the problems of the contemporary globalized world can contribute to the perpetuation of neocolonial injustice as manifested in ongoing neoliberal projects. In support of this argument, the paper (1) uses critical-discourse theorizing by Norman Fairclough as an example of CDA applying West-centered democratic discourse to the issues of global neoliberalization, (2) substantiates its analysis through the example of the neoliberalization of contemporary Ukraine, and (3) draws on criticism of West-centered political discourse by postcolonial and decolonial scholars.<br />\n","Abstract Body: As political, social, and religious issues cause greater polarization within our society, it is necessary to consider how we can agree to disagree. This paper analyzes the communication within a United States Christian denomination to understand how they invoke a communal dilemma over the topic of LGBTQ+ inclusion and acceptance. Using the Ethnography of Communication approach, data were collected from participant observation, online sources, and interviews. The analysis shows that members on both sides of the debate invoke the communal dilemma as a way to express disagreement or support, while also acknowledging the complexity of the problem. The invocation of the communal dilemma also allows for the topic to be contested, maintained, and negotiated further. This paper contributes to research on communal dilemmas as a resource for interaction, as well as research on religious conflict within church denominations.\n","Abstract Body: Narrative persuasion is an important tool for influencing health behavior. Diagnostic narratives, or stories focused on receiving an illness diagnosis, are a common narrative genre that patients and survivors naturally utilize to tell their stories. Implementing the features of diagnostic narratives into mass health messaging will likely increase believability and therefore persuasiveness of messages. The current review defines diagnostic narratives, delineates their features, and details ten future directions for research. Diagnostic narratives follow a three-act structure, include at least one of three types of conflict (normalcy, control, and uncertainty), and use five stylistic features (first person voice, direct report speech, explicit orientation to time, brief orientation to space, and metaphors). Future research should test the effectiveness of these features in mass health messaging as well as the mechanisms through which these features affect behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs.\n","Abstract Body: The study of narrative persuasion explores the strategic benefits of presenting information in a narrative form. Although theorizing in this area has proposed that people may be more persuaded by information when it is presented within a story, we argue here that there is room for greater theoretical understanding as to why this may be the case. The results from a lab-based, pre-registered experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 540) support our primary argument that processing narratives is easier than processing non-narratives, and when processing is eased, persuasion becomes more likely. We further demonstrate that the effects of processing fluency are more robust than another commonly considered mechanism of narrative persuasion, identification. Taken together, this work advances theory in narrative persuasion by offering a parsimonious explanation for the advantages of providing strategic information within a story.\n","Abstract Body: Affective disposition theory describes how viewers come to like or dislike narrative characters. Recently, AUTHOR presented an extension of affective disposition theory that incorporates balance theory to explain how interdependence between characters can influence the disposition formation process. The current paper presents two studies that test this logic experimentally. The logic and the findings of the studies are couched within current understandings of character networks—the relationships between various narrative characters.\n","Abstract Body: Audience involvement can manifest itself in a somewhat paradoxical manner when it comes to actors, where viewers can be involved with an actor and his or her fictional characters simultaneously. Although attitudes and actions displayed on either side are typically seen as largely independent from one another, previous research has revealed that viewers often partially misattribute them to the real or fictional counterpart—a phenomenon that has turned out most effective when these attitudes and actions do not correspond (a so-called <i>actor-character mismatch<\/i>). Our research consisted of two studies (Study 1: <i>n<\/i> = 165; Study 2: <i>n<\/i> = 136) that aimed at extending previous research by demonstrating ontologically transcending consequences on viewers' audience involvement with likable or unlikable fictional characters when their actors behave against their roles by revealing either a likable or unlikable character (Study 1) or attitude (Study 2) in a bogus interview. The results of these studies provided evidence that such mismatching behaviors can affect viewers' character involvement, most notably their PSRs with the fictional character, in particular when the respective actor's behavior stands in stark contrast to his or her character's attitudes.\n","Abstract Body: The impact of narrative versus non-narrative format on learning has received limited attention. In this study, individuals were assigned to or given a choice between either a narrative or non-narrative stimulus and completed a memory quiz. We examined whether transportability improved learning from narrative material. Results found choice improved quiz score, but found no difference in score between formats. Furthermore, transportability was correlated with quiz score only in the narrative conditions.\n","Abstract Body: An experiment assessed self-connections to tragic entertainment in a 3 (Mortality Salience of Self vs. Loved One vs. Control) X 2 (Tragic Entertainment: Moderate vs. High Eudaimonic Quality) factorial design. Mortality salience of loved ones increased mixed affect only for highly eudaimonic movies. Mixed affect, in turn, predicted boundary expansion of the self-concept and identification with the protagonist. Individuals may open up to eudaimonic entertainment if the fear of losing loved ones is salient.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Reflective imaginative involvement (RII) involves people’s asynchronous involvement with a narrative. RII is concerned with what people do with narratives after the original engagement with the story. Slater, Ewoldsen, and Wood (2018) developed a scale measuring RII which focused primarily on characters. The current paper reports two studies which expanded the original RII scale to measure people’s asynchronous engagement with characters, events from a story, and a narrative’s backstory. In addition, the scale differentiates between two different types of RII: simple veridical recall of the original narrative versus counterfactually changing the original narrative when engaged in RII.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: asynchronous engagement, characters, events, backstory, narratives, counterfactuals.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Based on communication theories of narrative engagement and psychological theories of embodied cognition, we hypothesized that a fit between the psychological state of a protagonist and the physical sensation of the viewer would enhance his or her identification, but not a para-social relationship, with the protagonist. We also hypothesized that identification and a para-social relationship would lead to distinct effects on attitudes related to the narrative. Participants were randomly assigned to either a warm or cool room where they watched a movie clip alone in which a suffering protagonist wanted to undergo euthanasia while his close others wanted him to stay alive. In accordance with the hypotheses, the results demonstrated that feeling cold enhanced identification with the suffering protagonist. Yet, the environmental temperature did not affect the development of para-social relationships. Moreover, identification with the suffering protagonist contributed to acceptance of his attitudes, reflected in more positive views of euthanasia. In contrast, having a para-social relationship resulted in negative attitudes toward euthanasia.<br />\n","Abstract Body: With the rise of streaming platforms such as Netflix, media users can watch full seasons of a TV series at once. As a result, many people have adopted an “excessive” mode of series consumption, which is often referred to as binge-watching. Binge-watching is particularly common with continuous serials, which often employ cliffhangers. The interruption of the narration at a critical point seems likely to foster (unintended) binge-watching. An experiment (N=83) was conducted to investigate if cliffhangers lead to more suspense and a stronger desire to continue watching a series, and if they affect the entertainment experience. The results suggest that cliffhangers do not seem to promote binge-watching. However, cliffhangers lead to more suspense after the viewing session, which may negatively impact media users’ well-being and sleep.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Series finales can elicit a wide-range of emotions and responses from viewers. Some finales are remembered for providing answers (e.g., <i>Six Feet Under<\/i>), whereas others are debated for their lack of resolution (e.g., <i>The Sopranos<\/i>). Using an online questionnaire (<i>N<\/i>=840) this study empirically examined whether perceptions of narrative closure and the outcomes main characters experience differentially impact affective responses, appreciation, and enjoyment, and whether these variables, in turn, affect coping behaviors. The findings indicate that viewers are less distressed, experience more positive and meaningful affect, and enjoy and appreciate viewing finales that leave them with their questions answered. Likewise, viewing positive outcomes for main characters results in less distress and more positive and meaningful affect. Furthermore, strong affective responses result in more coping behaviors post-viewing. Interestingly, higher levels of appreciation lead to more coping behaviors, whereas higher levels of enjoyment result in less coping. Finales that offer more resolution and more positive outcomes may thus be more satisfying, and, as a result, perhaps reduce recovery efforts by limiting the need for post-viewing rumination, information-seeking, and analysis.\n","Abstract Body: An experiment assessed when tragic movies about the loss of loved ones may invite viewers to gently approach their fear of death, using a 2 (Mortality Salience; Control) x 3 (Movie Ending: Positive, Negative, Mixed) design. Mixed endings in combination with mortality reminders decreased death avoidance among older participants, but increased death avoidance for younger participants. Mixed movie endings may allow older (but not younger) viewers to gently approach salient fears about life’s transience.<br />\n","Abstract Body: For years, the UNHCR has published stories about refugees that seek to raise awareness and invoke support. Based on the narrative transportation theory, this study investigated the effects of framing (episodic vs. thematic) and epilogues (with or without) on readers’ transportation and identification, as well as behavioral intentions to support UNHCR’s efforts. The findings suggest that reading stories about refugees can elicit more altruistic behavioral intentions when readers were more transportive and had higher identification.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines whom people in the United States (<i>n<\/i> = 1,261) and Germany (<i>n<\/i> = 1,231) perceive to be responsible for regulating online user comments on news articles – law enforcement (the state), platforms (Facebook), news organizations, or users themselves. Using two surveys, we found that Germans had greater support for free speech than Americans. Germans also attributed greater responsibility for online comment regulation to Facebook, news organizations, and law enforcement than Americans.\n","Abstract Body: See uploaded file\n","Abstract Body: Background Literature and Theory<br />Sexual assault, harassment, and other forms of gender-based mistreatment are prevalent on college campuses around the world (Boucek, 2016). In the United States, Title IX mandates any educational institutions receiving federal funds must not engage in discrimination on the basis of sex, and universities are scrambling to ensure compliance with this statute. Part of that process is an attempt to educate students, faculty, and staff about expectations and protections via media campaigns. This extended abstract contains a brief overview of media effects processes, campaign evaluation methods, and background on Title IX before explaining study methodology, data collection, proposed analysis, and outlining potential outcomes.<br />Models of media effects. Perse (2001) posits four primary models of media effects: direct (i.e., immediate, short term), conditional (i.e., individualized), cumulative (i.e., long term, enduring effects), and cognitive-transactional (i.e., immediate, one-shot exposure). The current study focuses on the cumulative media effects of a coordinated and long-term multi-modal Title IX campaign on a major university campus.<br />Campaign evaluation. In an attempt to increase campaign success, evaluation research is performed in three stages: formative research, conducted during campaign development, process evaluation, undertaken after the campaign is launched, and summative evaluation, performed in the later phases of campaign life  (Atkin & Freimuth, 2013; Atkin & Rice, 2012; Noar, 2006). Formative research aims to gather information (e.g., knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, values, media preferences) about the target audience  to inform message design (Atkin & Freimuth, 2013). Messages may also be pretested during the design process which enables adjustments if needed before finalizing messages and launching the campaign (Atkin & Freimuth, 2013). As a campaign unfolds, process evaluation can be performed to assess the effectiveness of campaign implementation and identify potential shortcomings (Atkin & Rice, 2012; Noar, 2006). Summative evaluation, the final stage, is conducted to gauge outcomes resulting from the campaign (Atkin & Rice, 2012). This work focuses on a summative evaluation of a multi-modal campus-based campaign about Title IX issues including sexual harassment and sexual assault. That is, campaign effectiveness in meeting goals will be assessed and recommendations for a) campaign improvement, and b) future work will be provided.<br />Title IX. Per the US Education Amendments of 1972, Title IX states: \"\"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance\"\" (Office for Civil Rights, 1979). In 2011, the U.S. Department of Education sent higher education institutions a Dear Colleague letter explaining that Title IX defines sexual violence (e.g., rape, sexual assault) as a form of discrimination, and therefore, institutions are responsible for conducting investigations and addressing cases of sexual violence reported by students (Ali, 2011; Lave, 2016). This was largely in response to statistics on sexual violence in college (i.e., nearly 1 in 5 females experience sexually assault on college campuses) (Ali, 2011; Krebs, Lindquist, Warner, Fisher, & Martin, 2007).<br />The Dear Colleague Letter outlined requirements of higher education institutions (e.g., having a Title IX coordinator), as well as processes to remedy hostile environments (e.g., via counseling), and suggested measures should be taken to prevent the occurrence of sexual violence including creation and dissemination of preventive education programs (Ali, 2011). Many preventive education programs and Title IX campaigns have been instituted since this 2011 letter (e.g., Know your IX), and with varied results. Some campaigns promoting bystander intervention successfully increased college students’ positive attitudes toward intervention and intention to intervene (Sundstrom et al., 2018). However, misperceptions about sexual assault persist among college students that decrease their intention to intervene as bystanders (DeMaria et al., 2018). Title IX remains an extremely important and emergent issue affecting not only college students, but all individuals working on college campuses. <br />Let’s Be Clear Campaign. The Let’s Be Clear campaign was instituted in January 2018 at a very large state university in the southeastern United States. The campaign was developed by university communications and marketing staff based on formative evaluation conducted by communication researchers. The campaign clearly identified examples of inappropriate behaviors and explained those behaviors would not be tolerated while also providing access to information and resources on a campaign website. “Let’s Be Clear” stickers were placed on the back of every restroom stall on campus, buses were wrapped in campaign messaging, video messages were shared, a website was developed, and a considerable amount of “swag” was distributed on campus. Process evaluation indicated 35% saturation within two months of implementation (XXXX, 2018). Summative evaluation is essential to assess campaign success and identify (in)effective messaging strategies that could address this important topic in the future.<br />Research Questions<br /><i>RQ1: What do participants recall about campaign messages? <\/i><br /><i>RQ2: How do participants perceive campaign messages in terms of: a) purpose, b) effectiveness? <\/i><br /><i>RQ3: Concerning message content, what do participants identify as a) positive aspects, b) negative aspects, c) recommendations to improve message effectiveness? <\/i><br /><i>RQ4: Concerning the visual aspect of messages, what do participants identify as a) positive aspects, b) negative aspects, c) recommendations to improve message effectiveness? <\/i><br /><i>RQ5: What did participants learn from the campaign? <\/i><br /> <br />Method<br />There were 32 total participants across six focus groups. Focus groups had between two and seven student participants. Average age was 20.37 and 59.38% of participants were female. Race/ethnicity was slightly more diverse than general campus composition with 27.3% of participants self-identifying as White (non-Hispanic), 12.1% Black (non-Hispanic), 36.4% Hispanic or Latino/a, 6.1% Asian or Pacific Islander, and 15.2% indicating multiple categories.<br />Procedure. A focus group moderator guide draft was developed by the researchers and shared with relevant campus offices for feedback. A revised moderator guide was approved by the university Institutional Review Board (IRB) along with a study protocol and stimulus materials. Participants received a $10 gift card for their participation and were informed they were being audio recorded but ensured their responses would remain confidential. After reading a brief explanation of research, participants completed a short survey with demographic questions. All focus groups were transcribed by trained researchers.<br />Moderator Guide. The focus group moderator guide was divided into four categories: 1) campaign knowledge assessment, 2) message investigation, 3) Title IX, and 4) website investigation. Given the focus of the current research is summative evaluation of the campaign, the primary focus of this work is campaign knowledge, and message/website investigation.<br />Data summary<br />The data for this study have been collected and the audio recordings have been completely transcribed. However, due to the time-intensive nature of qualitative coding, the qualitative analysis will not be complete until January 2020. Transcripts are being thoroughly examined using Owen’s (1984) steps of thematic analysis including close reading and coding for frequency and intensity to address the research questions posed.<br />Potential outcomes<br />              This research will provide insight into the most impactful campaign components as well as areas for improvement. Data from participants will indicate the cumulative effects of repeated exposure to campaign materials. Preliminary results suggest a lack of clarity of campaign intentions and available resources. Pathways for future work in this area will be identified to address the most fruitful pathways to address Title IX using multiple modes and mediums.<br />References<br />Ali, R.

We propose that inferential reasoning ability (IRA) – the knowledge of and skill at applying inferential and statistical principles – counteracts the biasing influence of vivid exemplars. In two experiments, we explore this potential moderator by eliciting responses to a news story about the Boston Marathon Bombing and then, with improved measurement of IRA, responses to an adapted hyperlocal news story about carjacking. In both studies, we find evidence that IRA moderates the influence of vivid exemplars on judgments about risk. Namely, it appears exemplars conditionally influence cognitive perceptions of risk (i.e., estimated percentages of death) when accounting for IRA. Theoretical implications and practical considerations for inclusion of IRA in research on exemplification and media effects more broadly are considered, as well as needs for additional clarification on this new construct.\n","Abstract Body: Public opinion on critical issues, such as technology deployment aimed at reducing greenhouse gases or increasing energy efficiency, may be impacted through information disseminated through the media. It is therefore increasingly important to understand the role media plays in spreading misinformation to the public. Through this study, we add to the growing body of literature on misinformation by exploring the relationship between media attention, risk perceptions, knowledge and support for smart meter technology. Smart meter deployment has been hindered, in part due to false beliefs that the technology causes cancer or can lead to incorrect electricity billing. To examine the relationship between misinformation and support for smart meter technology, we analyzed a quota sample of 1,035 people living in the U.S. Results show that paying attention to smart meter stories is related to the awareness of false information about smart meters. Awareness of false information is also associated with misperceiving risks regarding the technology (e.g., those who are aware of false information about health problems associated with smart meters, are more concerned about health-related problems associated with this technology). Ultimately, reporting higher levels of concern about smart meters is associated with lower support for government and industry policies aimed at increasing smart meter installation. However, the misperceptions which decreased support for smart meters were only present among those with low knowledge levels of the technology. Results indicate that knowledge may be a protective factor in terms of mitigating the effects that misinformation could have on outcomes such as support for policies or technological developments.\n","Abstract Body: This study, using a survey-experiment with a sample of 149 students randomly drawn from 102 US college campuses, testes the effects of four versions of a message about the new scientific issue of water-energy-food (WEF) nexus at the level of agenda, knowledge (frame), attitude, and behavioral intention. The study found subjects’ attitude associated with subjects’ frame on one end and behavioral intention on the other end, and identifies some effects across the groups. The unclear positions of subjects’ agenda in the hierarchy of response that processes the nexus message are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: We harness a novel computational method to analyze more than 150 scripts of top grossing romantic comedies. We identify prevalent romantic comedy themes, thematic relationships, and thematic evolution. Additional meta-data will examine effects related to budget, profit, and gender. Following thematic analysis, we will experimentally examine  high-budget films are more likely than low-budgeted ones to increase gender-biased attitudes, or intentions to follow romantic comedies scripts in real world relationships, among other research questions.\n","Abstract Body: People might avoid entertainment if they think other people will ostrasize and ridicule them for warching. We tested this possibility in an experiment where participants indicated their willingness and intention to watch a film starring an actor accused of sexual assault. Information about the film varied in terms of critics’ ratings (positive, negative, or no review score) and whether there were explicit social sanctions for viewing the film. The results show although both perceived quality and perceived injunctive norms influenced willingness to watch, perceived film quality was a more important predictor of behavioral willingness and intention to watch than norms. Norms, on the other hand, acted as an additive source of influence that encouraged avoidance of poorly-rated films. The results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical implications to both the media avoidance and social norms literature.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Representations of older adult (OA) characters were examined in Christmas television movies, while using multiple goals theory and positive altercasting to understand the effect of OA positive stereotypes on OA appearances in the films. Hallmark holiday films (n = 47) were analyzed, a popular genre that has received little research attention. OA characters were assessed for representations, stereotypes, and their interactions were coded for altercasting. Unlike prime time television, OAs were not under represented relative to the general US population. OAs portrayed a variety of stereotypes and engaged in positive altercasting at a rate similar to non-OA characters. Importantly, conditional mediation analyses confirmed the theory, finding that positive altercasting completely mediated the effect of OA Sage stereotype on the frequency of OA appearances, and that the effect occurred when OAs was also portrayed as a friend. Implications for studying television interactions, stereotypes, and older adults in media contexts are discussed. <br /> <br />\n","Abstract Body: Social TV viewing has changed the way individuals watch television content. Interestingly, individuals still engage with virtual co-viewers in an online space while watching television with others in a physically shared space. To address the unique nature of social TV viewing in a physical co-viewing context, the present study distributed an online survey regarding people’s television watching behavior, particularly in the context of Super Bowl. Primary results suggest that physical co-viewing enjoyment predicted the information motive for social TV viewing, whereas perceived belongingness in the physical co-viewing context predicted the entertainment motive for social TV viewing. Social presence also functioned as a mediator between the frequency of social TV engagement and social TV enjoyment. Finally, television watching enjoyment was most strongly predicted by physical co-viewing enjoyment.\n","Abstract Body: Using media, specifically those that offer entertainment, frequently conflicts with other goals and obligations in daily life. Users can navigate these conflicts either by applying self-control and upholding their goals, or by giving in to media temptations, which elicits negative emotional appraisals such as guilt that potentially spoil media entertainment. Currently, a systematic integration of self-control and entertainment theory is direly needed to guide future work in this area. The goals of the present submission are thus twofold: 1) First, we introduce the Appraisal of Media Use, Self-Control, and Entertainment (AMUSE) model. The AMUSE model systematizes the available empirical evidence on the role of self-control for the selection, processing, and effects of (entertaining) media content and, on this basis, 2) provides testable propositions for future research.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The current quantitative content analysis of 548 interracial interactions on primetime television applies insights from communication accommodation theory as well as parasocial/mediated intergroup contact in documenting the content features that may encourage favorable/unfavorable interracial dynamics in society. The sample included a composite week of primetime television (83 programs), constructed from a random sample of entertainment shows airing from September-November 2018. Human and computer based coding was used. Results from mixed-model analyses revealed linguistic patterns aligned with racial/ethnic stereotypes and inauspicious real-world dynamics for both Blacks and Latinas/os; with findings to be interpreted in light of theoretical assumptions.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Reciprocity expectations are the perceived likelihood that an outgroup member will return a favor or seek retribution. These expectations are implicated in intergroup interaction through the theory of Bounded Generalized Reciprocity (BGR) which hypothesizes that expectations of reciprocity provides the foundation for ingroup favoritism and outgroup discrimination. The present experiment tests assumptions about helping behavior by Black men, and those assumptions’ influence on reciprocity expectations. Participants (<i>n<\/i>=232) from a national U.S. sample were randomly assigned to view a news clip in which a Black or White hero saves a person who was White, or whose race was not portrayed. Participants who viewed a Black hero with an ambiguous victim were significantly more likely to assume that the victim was not White – indicating an assumption of low positive reciprocity. Victim race assumptions and hero race predicted future reciprocity expectations. This has implications for the portrayal of intergroup helping behaviors in media.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Research on the positive and negative effects of active versus passive Facebook use on subjective well-being has received increased attention in the last years. The current study expands on this research, exploring how posting different types of content on Facebook (inspiring vs. funny) or browsing Facebook passively affects not only subjective but also eudaimonic well-being, as well as connectedness and compassion. The results of a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study of 10 days (N = 111) revealed small but promising effects for engaging in and posting inspiring content for satisfaction with life, negative affect, eudaimonic well-being, and compassion. Passive use reduced life satisfaction but otherwise did not affect any of the outcome variables significantly. Posting funny content was particularly detrimental for eudaimonic well-being over time. Additionally, neither condition changed participants' feelings of connectedness to humanity. Findings are discussed within the larger dialogue of social media’s effects on well-being.\n","Abstract Body: Many studies in the field of positive media psychology have investigated the effects of meaningful film on viewer’s feelings of connectedness, this while music is the number #1 media source for feeling moved, touched or inspired. Consequently, the current study examined the role of meaningful compared to pleasurable music on listeners emotional experiences, feelings of connectedness, and altruistic behaviors. In a pre-posttest experiment, 105 students (<i>M<\/i><sub>age<\/sub> = 23.800; <i>SD<\/i> = 6.082; 77.3% female) listened to either their favorite meaningful music or their favorite pleasurable music. Results revealed that listening to meaningful music lead to greater meaningful affect, contemplation, having a lump in one’s throat and tears crying, a stronger motivation to seek what matters in life, and a stronger desire to express love to close others, compared to listening to pleasurable music. Both listening to meaningful and pleasurable music were found to lead to strong emotions, a desire to connect to others, and same levels of altruism. In sum, meaningful and pleasurable music can evoke a different mix of emotions, however, both are intense and open our hearts to others.\n","Abstract Body: The present study compared the influence of romantic relationship announcements in parasocial romantic relationship (PSRR) and unrequited love (UL) in interpersonal relationships. Two versions of a survey were administered to 330 college students in a large eastern Chinese university. The strength of PSRR was lower than the strength of UL. Stronger PSRR and UL were associated with more negative emotional reactions to the love objects'romantic relationship announcements. The emotional reactions to media figures’ romantic relationships announcements were less negative than the reactions to the love objects’ romantic relationship announcements in UL. People reported less closeness reduction in PSRR than in UL when learning of love objects' romantic relationship announcements. People also exhibited different behavioral responses to the announcements by media figures in PSRR and by love objects in UL.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Emotional intelligence (EI) is a critical life skill associated with many positive psychological and social outcomes. Yet, there is general concern that the media diet of today’s youth could compromise the development of those crucial abilities as eyes-on-screens may inhibit the opportunity to practice the skills of emotion perception, understanding and management.  In this study, 403 parents reported on their own and their children's EI levels and media use habilts.  Results indicated no evidence of an association beween screen use and EI level, though being read to by a parent associated with higher child EI.  Interestingly, a parent's more frequent use of their mobile device in the presence of their child negatively associated with that child's EI level.  Thus, any problem with screen use and EI level may not stem from the child's screen activities but from the parents' behavior around their children.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study provides behavioral evidence detailing youth’s health information seeking behaviors over a previously unstudied social media site (i.e., the <i>Trill Project<\/i>[TP]) through leveraging users’ digital trace data (<i>n<\/i>= 1,954). By investigating users’ following behaviors of particular health-related post tags (a message feature analogous to hashtags), we present evidence that health information seeking over social media varies as a function of individual-level factors, including user’s age and gender. Further, we investigate the demographic characteristics of users sitewide across TP (<i>N<\/i>= 40,380), and propose a novel, integrative model detailing an approach to automatically classify media content (e.g., user-bios), which combines the strengths of computational and traditional content analytical methods. Results affirm previous self-report findings investigating youth’s health information seeking behaviors over social media (e.g., Wartella et al., 2016), and illustrate that TP caters to a diverse user audience—predominantly youth (ages 12-25) and those within the LGBT+ community.\n","Abstract Body: Emerging adulthood/late adolescence is a time that is marked by a number of changes in the ways young adults view themselves and themselves in relation to others. A number of studies have suggested that <i>sexting<\/i> – the sending or receiving of a sexually suggestive or provocative text message, photo, or video of oneself or another person via smartphone, the Internet, or social networking websites – may significantly impact how adolescents view ourselves in relation to others. While previous research has considered some motivations for sexting, they have not considered the impact that family communication in childhood and adolescence may have on sexting. This study fills this gap by examining the impact that Family Communication Patterns have on attitudes toward sexting, current sexting behavior, and future intentions of sexting. To test these relationships, data was collected from 434 emerging adult respondents. Results suggest both direct and indirect relationships between the variables. Findings show a total, indirect negative effect of conformity orientation (a type of Family Communication Pattern) on likelihood of sexting, mediated by positive attitudes toward sexting, seeking comfort/advice from peers, and current sexting behaviors. These findings are discussed in the context of family communication, adolescent psychosocial development, and media use.<br /><br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: Family Communication Pattern (FCP); sexting; emerging adults; adolescent psychosocial development; media use; risky behavior<br />\n","Abstract Body: Multi-social media use—messaging apps (e.g., Line) and social network sites (SNSs; e.g., Facebook)—has become increasingly prominent among older adults, but this phenomenon remains understudied. This study uses a nationally representative sample of Taiwanese adults aged 60 years or older (Study 1; <i>N<\/i> = 242) and interview data (Study 2; <i>N<\/i> = 26) to understand antecedences of multi-social media use and its associated outcomes in the older population. Results show that both technological and social forces are central factors that operate across older adults’ adoption of both messaging apps and SNSs. Findings further indicate that although multi-social media users do not necessarily have more access to strong and weak relationships than others, messaging apps and SNSs play different roles in older adults’ everyday lives.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The Fukushima Nuclear Disaster in March 2011 permanently changed the lives of Fukushima residents by altering their physical and social environments. Many residents had to leave their homes and settle in other communities both within and outside of the Fukushima Prefecture. The majority of Fukushima residents have been dealing with a new, negative identity of “Fukushima” that has been imposed upon them. In such a context, the present study examines the role of three types of “local storytelling” based on communication infrastructure theory: connectedness to offline local media, obtaining local information on social media, and engaging in expressions about local affairs on social media. Based on a survey of 1000 Fukushima residents, the study result indicates that mainstream media connectedness is positively related to both offline and online local storytelling, indicating complementary, rather than competitive, relationships between local and mainstream media. Offline local media connectedness and expressive communications about local affairs on social media positively influence collective efficacy, while all three offline and online local storytelling and collective efficacy have positive effects on offline civic participation. Implications of the results in the context of Fukushima and other disaster situations are discussed. <br />\n","Abstract Body: In this paper, I propose a theoretical framework called news reading publics to understand news consumption as a global socio-political process. I first draw from a variety of existing communication theories and argue that most Western-centric research on news consumption paints a parochial picture by not focusing on the cultural aspect of the consumption process. I next describe the use of a network-based methodology to theorize the existence of these news reading publics in a culturally variegated context, validate it using a novel dataset of online audiences from India and demonstrate its ability to offer a rigorous comparative framework for studying audiences across diverse countries.\n","Abstract Body: We investigate how perceived negative and positive effects of polling news are linked to political behaviors through emotions. In Study 1, the results show that perceived positive effect of polling news on the self may strengthen individuals’ support for their preferred candidate directly and indirectly through pride. To further explore how candidate preference moderates the mediation of emotions in the associations between perceived negative and positive effects of polling news and political behaviors, Study 2 was conducted. In Study 2, the results of two web-based surveys conducted before and after the 2018 mayoral election in Seoul, South Korea demonstrate that perceived negative effect of polling news is positively related to campaign discourse engagement through anxiety. Perceived positive effect of polling news is indirectly linked to reinforcement of support through pride particularly for supporters of winning candidate. Implications of the findings and limitations of the study are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: In Hong Kong, public discontent against the government has evolved into several civil disobedience campaigns in the past few years, and digital media platforms served to channel public sentiments and influence collective action. Within the theoretical framework of the O-S-O-R model, this study analyzed the Asian Barometer Survey (ABS) data and found that online political expression had a significant negative impact on government evaluation. Moreover, internal political efficacy was found to influence government evaluation negatively, and it also served as a significant mediator between both online information seeking and expression, and government evaluation. Furthermore, democratic preference was found to be a significant moderator varying the effect of expression and government evaluation. Our findings have crucial implications in understanding social movements.\n",null,"Abstract Body: While there is mounting evidence that humor can be an effective means of engaging publics, much remains to be learned about the contextual factors that shape how audiences receive and process humorous content. Analyzing data from a controlled experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 217), this study explores humor in the context of science communication. Specifically, we focus on the differential impact of exposure to stand-up comedy featuring a scientist that generates considerable laughter from the audience vs. stand-up comedy from the same source, but lacking audience reaction. Among the key findings, audience laughter served to heighten the affective response of viewers, and affective response was positively linked to two forms of audience engagement with science.\n","Abstract Body: To examine the effect of political satire that is increasingly reaching a foreign audience, we have collected experimental data in two countries while employing the same stimuli. This study examines the differential effects of Dutch satire (about the U.S.) on audiences located in the United States and the Netherlands. Building on extant research, the current study includes a comparative analysis between two nations, examining the potential impact of exported satire. Results suggest that horatian and juvenalian satire differentially influence the hedonic experiences (i.e., emotions) of Dutch and American audiences, as well as differentially impact their individual-level feelings of nationalism. These effects are moderated by age, which is discussed in the context of extant work regarding boundary conditions for satire absorption.\n","Abstract Body: Political memes have been previously studied in different contexts, but this study provides insight into the discourses of fake news on Instagram. The authors collected more than 550,00 Instagram posts sent by over 198,000 unique users from 24 February 2012 to 21 December 2018, using the hashtag #fakenews as a search term. It uses topic modelling to identify the most recurrent topics that are dominant on the platform, while the most active users are identified to understand the nature of the online communities that discuss fake news. The study findings show that the largest community of active users are supporters of the US President Donald Trump and the Republican Party, mostly trolling liberal mainstream media especially CNN, while often aligning themselves with the far-right. On the other hand, a much smaller online community attempts to troll Trump and Republicans. Theoretically, the study relies on political memes literature and argues that Instagram has become weaponized through an ongoing “meme war”, for many members in the two main online communities troll and attack each other to exert power over the online chatter on the platform.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Populist parties are on the rise in Europe and research has attributed their success to the use of social media and related to that, to the use of emotionally and morally charged communication. Based on Moral Foundation Theory, which argues for the intuitive nature of morality, this study investigated the use of moral sentiments in populist parties’ social media communication. Empirically, we carried out two separated, yet related computer-based content analysis studies using the Moral Foundation Dictionary on Facebook posts by political parties in Spain, focusing on the left-winged populist party Podemos (study 1) and Germany, focusing on the right-winged populist AfD (study 2). Results indicate that compared with traditional parties in the two systems, the German AfD strongly relied on moral sentiments in their social media communication. Findings for Podemos in Spain were less clear but pointed into the direction of populist parties’ recurring on specific moral sentiments in their Facebook communication.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper enquires into rhetorical conceptualization and the politics of definition of the “people” by taking a closer look at the media discourse in three Turkish dailies during the June 2018 national elections which marked the Turkey’s<br /><i>transition<\/i> from the parliamentary <i>system<\/i> to the <i>presidential<\/i> one. By utilizing semiotic analysis and relying on the critical discourse analysis, the author argues that the pro-government media such as <i>Yeni Safak<\/i> and <i>Hürriyet<\/i> employ the “people” for mobilizing and enlivening hegemonic populist discourses of the ruling party (AKP) through the articulation of the ideology of nationalism and the discourse of Islam with the Neo-Ottomanism (Turkey’s foreign policy approach towards the former Ottoman lands). By re-configuring discursive practices pro-government dailies imposed a new semantic-conceptual relation between the people, the AKP, and Erdoğan and created new semantic links among these concepts which reinforce the self-inflicted position of the AKP government as the genuine representative of “the people.” However, the oppositional press such as <i>Birgün<\/i> strives to take a different semantic position by decontextualizing and, then, re-contextualizing the “people” and challenges a sternly nationalist and Islamic populist discourse around the concept. However, eventually, both the left- and the right-wing media, in a very distinctive way, serve for deepening polarization in the Turkish society, the politics and the media which thrives the right-wing populism.\n","Abstract Body: Governments and organizations have expressed concerns regarding lack of diversity in the media regarding body size to promote positive body image and prevent eating disorders. The advertising industry has started to take note on such issues and mainstream brands such as Axe are attempting to change their casting practices. However, this is not the norm in the majority of ads. Interviews were conducted with twenty advertising professionals while at the <i>Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity<\/i>to provide a previously neglected perspective on this debate. Thematic analysis identified eight themes. Results show that practitioners are aware about a lack of diverse male bodies in advertising, that often times body type casting is seen as dependent on the product or brand fit, and that there has been an internalization of thin ideals among professionals.\n","Abstract Body: The influencer trend, where celebrities, bloggers, etc. are often paid by brands to use, talk about and otherwise promote their products on social media has become increasingly popular.  We seek to investigate whether the reason a person follows an influencer interacts with perceived homophily (a known precursor to friendships) such that the reason may mediate the effect of perceived homophily and offer context as to subsequent purchase intent. Additionally, we examine the potential interaction between perceived homophily and perceived authenticity. We suggest that an influencer who is perceived as more “authentic” will mediate the relationship between perception of homophily and subsequent purchase intent. Our results advance theory on homophily and perceived authenticity in the context of influencer marketing.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Gender inequality remains pernicious, and while prior research suggests that messaging by men can garner broader support from both men and women around gender equality issues, questions remain about how this influence might operate in a social media environment. Our study looks at a social media message posted by a man about getting more men involved in gender equality and how the extent to which the presumed gender identity of the message’s social endorsers might indicate group norms and affect solidarity for the cause of gender equality among men. We find that there is no difference in the estimation of percentage of men and women who “liked” the tweet when seeing pictures of women endorsers versus seeing no gender endorsement pictures, indicating that there is an assumption that women are the ones endorsing this type of message absent any other indication. We further find that higher estimations of the percentage of male endorsers, regardless of condition, lead men to express greater message support, online sharing intentions, gender equality policy support, and collective action intentions. This has implications for gender equality messaging on social media because even if a message is sent by a man, the perceptions of its endorsers as women will decrease gender equality support.\n","Abstract Body: Aiming to fill a research gap, this study focuses on describing a common purchase experience—impulsive purchase—in eWOM messages, and how this impulsive cue, review valence, and product attribute jointly affect  reader’s product evaluation and purchase decision. An online experiment was conducted, and a three-way interaction was discovered. Results of this study contributes to the eWOM literature and Language Expectancy Theory, and provides additional evidence for a positivity bias towards hedonic attributes.\n","Abstract Body: The current study explores how consumers process brand transgression news on social media, in consideration of the unique structure of social media news consumption where the heuristic evaluation of the news title and the public’s reaction precedes their evaluation of news content. A 2 (the quantity of social cues: high vs. low) × 2 (the quality of brand transgression article: high vs. low) × 2 (issue involvement: high vs. low) full-factorial experiment was conducted. Low- and moderate-involvement participants perceived the brand transgression news as more severe when the news quality was high, which led to more negative brand attitudes. For those with high involvement, perceived issue severity was not affected by the news quality. For low- involvement participants, high news quality increased their perceived severity of the brand transgression news, which in turn, reduced purchase intention, but only when the news was accompanied with a large number of social cues. For moderate-involvement participants, high news quality enhanced issue severity and reduced purchase intention regardless of the number of social cues. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: People consume and enjoy similar media entertainment as their friends and close others do, yet little is known about the underlying psychological processes driving selection and consumption of normative entertainment. Given that individuals’ behaviors and attitudes are influenced by the perceived prevalence of others’ behaviors (descriptive norms) and perceptions of what others approve (injunctive norms), we examined the role of descriptive and injunctive norms in media selection and appraisal. In an online experiment, we tested whether perceptions of group norms influenced the enjoyment of a movie trailer and intention to watch the full film. We also tested the moderating roles of group identity and proximity on perceived norms and subsequent effects. Results showed that prevalance messages predicted perceived descriptive norms, which in turn predicted enjoyment of the trailer, anticipated enjoyment of the film, and intention to watch the film. Prevalence messages also predicted perceived injunctive norm, and the effect of injunctive norms on outcome variables was strengthened by group proximity and identity. The discussion highlights the ways that social norms can inform understandings of media selection in future work.\n","Abstract Body: According to current theorizing in entertainment psychology, appreciation is the hallmark of exposure to meaningful entertainment (e.g., tragic films; enlightening documentaries). However, there is little indication why ostensibly superficial material (e.g., children’s movies; pop music) might occasionally generate similar responses. The current paper argues that this content can evoke appreciation because it motivates audiences to reminisce on fond memories of their pasts. Specifically, Study 1 examined undergraduates’ (<i>N<\/i> = 375) responses to pop music enjoyed during their adolescent years, and Study 2 examined U.S. adults’ (<i>N<\/i> = 804) responses to holiday music enjoyed during their childhood years. Across both experiments, exposure to this music triggered memory recollection, induced psychological transportation into those memories, and produced higher levels of appreciation than exposure to comparable music released recently. However, mediation analyses indicated that this increase in appreciation occurred solely as a result of transportation, whereas memory recollection had no impact. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores the combination of humour and human interest television, which can lead to the simultaneous experience of hedonic enjoyment and eudaimonic appreciation, evoked by a single television programme. This qualitative audience study consists of 21 interviews with members of the general public, reflecting on their viewing experiences of <i>Taboe<\/i>, a Flemish television programme that combines humour and human interest about stigmatized groups. The research shows that audience members appreciate the combination of humour and human interest because the background information gives them permission to laugh at risky comedy, and because it avoids the negative affective moods that sometimes result from other human interest programmes about difficult topics. Additionally, viewers noted <i>Taboe<\/i>’s general positive tone of voice and praised the participants for their positive outlook on life in the face of challenges. This combination of enjoyment and reflection on life, leads us to conclude that combining hedonic and eudaimonic entertainment experiences could advance the way in which television producers talk about stigmatized groups, leading them a more inclusive, accessible and overall positive narrative.\n","Abstract Body: Using the mood management theory and selective exposure perspective, this study examines and compares the entertainment media selection between meaningful and funny video content when hedonic joyful mood or elevation is experienced. It also examines these two positive affects experienced after consuming chosen media content, and how they may affect prosociality. Specifically, it explores if individuals in the state of elevation will be more likely to choose elevation-inducing videos to view comparing to individuals in the affective state of hedonic joy, in order to maintain their existing self-transcendent good mood. Further, it investigates whether elevation-inducing meaningful video exposure, comparing to joy-inducing funny video exposure, would lead to greater likelihood of helping. As a result, elevation (in comparison to hedonic joy) led to continued exposure to the meaningful media after initial exposure. Moreover, more meaningful video exposure led to higher levels of elevation, which in turn led to higher likelihood of helping. Elevation had a stronger and more stable relationship with prosociality than hedonic joy did. The findings also supported the positive relationship between need for affect and elevation elicited by meaningful media content. The role of content types, entertainment preferences, individual differences in altruistic personality, and need for affect in the production of selective exposure and helping behaviors are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Crowdsourced vigilantism is a newly emerging practice where undefined Internet users expose misconducts and identify culprits in the form of crowdsourcing. This study proposes a theory-oriented framework with which we examine how exposure to press reports and social media use drive the practice of crowdsourced vigilantism to prevail as a social norm and impact individuals’ attitudes (perceived usefulness vs. perceived harmfulness) as well as behaviors (adoption vs. regulation). This framework was tested with web survey data of 486 adults in Taiwan. Results showed that exposure to press reports on crowdsourced vigilantism was both directly and indirectly associated individuals’ acceptance of or resistance to the practice. The indirect association was mediated by perceived social prevalence and perceived social approval of the practice.\n","Abstract Body: The idea that the success of media personae in attracting audiences and maintaining their loyalty depends on the creation of a pseudo-friendship, known as parasocial relationships, has been a mainstay of mass media research for more than half a century (Horton & Wohl, 1956). Expanding the scope of parasocial relationship research into the political realm, the notion that political support could be predicted based on the intensity of para-social relationships between voters and political figures was demonstrated in a recent study (Cohen & Holbert, 2018). The current exploration tests the predictive power of Political Para-Social Relationship (PPSR) in the context of the April and September 2019 Israeli election campaigns. Findings from a 7-wave online panel data (n=1,061) demonstrate that PPSR toward Netanyahu was a positive predictor of voting for Netanyahu's Likud party and a negative predictor of voting for opposition leader Benny Gantz's Blue and White party in both campaigns. The opposite was true for PPSR toward Benny Gantz which in both campaigns positively predicted voting for his Blue and White party and negatively predicted voting for Likud. The PPSR constructs also predicted shifts in party support from the February to October post-election waves of the study, and loyalty towards the parties. That is, the higher a respondent scored on the PPSR-Netanyahu scale, the more likely he or she were to shift support towards the Likud party and to intend to vote Likud in more waves of the survey and less likely to shift support toward the Blue and White party and to intend to vote Blue and White in more waves of the survey. The opposite was true for PPSR-Gantz. In all models, the PPSR constructs were among the strongest predictors of political support, together with a dummy variable for supporting the Likud party in the 2015 election.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Drawing upon the concept of parasocial interaction (PSI) with a TV performer, this paper examines the impact of a company spokesperson using narratives to respond to a crisis during a media interview. Theorizing of mass-mediated PSI (Moyer-Gusé, 2008) holds that narrative messages effectively persuade by viewers experiencing a pseudorelationship with a media figure, followed by less counterarguing of the message. A randomized experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 365) is reported in which a spokesperson in a televised news interview is questioned about a scandal that has gone viral online, and the spokesperson responds with either (a) on-topic narratives, (b) off-topic narrative spinning, or (c) nonnarrative information. Multiple mediator modeling indicates nonnarrative information most effectively bolsters purchase intentions and reduces negative word-of-mouth. The effect is mediated by PSI with the spokesperson, followed by a decrease in counterargument. Consistent with the theory of crisis response narratives (Heath, 2004) and the theory of crisis and renewal in media relations (Seeger & Sellnow, 2016), viewers react most adversely to narrative spinning.\n","Abstract Body: Two online experiments with a 2 (health message: health information vs. misinformation) X 2 (health issue: dandelion root for cancer treatment vs. GM mosquitoes for mosquito-borne disease control) factorial between-subjects design were conducted. To investigate what factors may prompt people to be more susceptible to the influence of misinformation, we explore the interaction of health mis/information message and trust in various social sectors, including trust in government, business, media, scientists, health professionals and consumer organizations, on attitudes about two health issues. The results are mixed, but both studies reveal the main effect of trust in government, suggesting trust in those institutions will make people less susceptible to the influence of health misinformation regardless of the health issue. Trust in business, health professionals, consumer organizations, mainstream media and scientists showed a more complicated pattern in influencing attitudinal outcomes along with health mis/information. Implications of the findings were discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Narratives have proven to hold persuasive capabilities, however, the exact psychological mechanism(s) that is/are responsible for this persuasion have been debated. The current study draws upon theories in both reactance (psychological reactance theory (PRT) (Brehm, 1966; Brehm & Brehm, 1981)) and narrative persuasion literature (the entertainment overcoming resistance model (EORM) (Moyer- Gusé, 2008) in order to uniquely identify and distinguish the role(s) transportation, character involvement, and/or emotional involvement play(s) in overcoming reactance. Second, this work distinguishes between perceived threat to freedom and reactance – a mediated process yet to be studied in narrative persuasion literature. Last, the influence of reactance proneness as a moderating variable in the context of narratives is examined. Results suggest a model that explains the relationship amongst the three psychological mechanisms and adds to reactance literature.<br />\n","Abstract Body: As the price of health insurance rises, many Americans have embraced crowdfunding – the online solicitation of funds from one's social network – to finance their personal medical needs. Past research has explored the persuasive narratives in medical crowdfunding campaigns, with a focus on the presentation of 'evidence' concerning a campaign's legitimacy and worthiness. The current study addresses the understudied context of non-life-threatening medical conditions – in particular, infertility and IVF treatment. This study adopts a narrative analysis framework to examine how IVF campaigns construct arguments for the urgency, direness, and worthiness of IVF treatment in a vulnerable online context, bearing in mind the need to appeal to both close friends and distant others while managing one's own identity and privacy needs.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Research has repeatedly found that exposure to ads displaying thin body ideals negatively affects women’s body image. As a response to these negative outcomes, alternative advertising content featuring non-idealized models has emerged. Current literature is however inconsistent about the effects of these models on young women’s body image. This inconsistency may be explained by the lack of attention to the different frames that are used to present non-idealized models. The current experimental study among 570 women aged 18 to 30 years (<i>M<\/i> = 21.45, <i>SD<\/i> = 1.84) aimed to address this gap and tested the effects of differently framed ads featuring non-idealized models on body image while taking into account the mediating role of cognitive schemas and the moderating role of thin-ideal internalization. Results showed no direct effects of framing on women’s body image or the activation of different schemas when using non-idealized models. These results differed however for idealized models. Also, no effects were found for thin-ideal internalization.\n","Abstract Body: This study is a systematic content analysis of body-related posts gay men create and are exposed to on non-dating social platforms. Our sample consisted of 600 posts (<i>Reddit, <\/i>n = 100; <i>Gay Forum,<\/i> n = 100; <i>Twitter,<\/i> n = 200; and <i>Instagram,<\/i> n = 200). Results showed that gay men discussed their bodies online in a predominantly positive way, in spite of the previous studies suggesting widespread appearance dissatisfaction. Differences between posts on text-oriented and image-oriented platforms are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines the emergent genre of “response videos” to analyze how YouTube influencers create a set of conditions under which harassment is made possible. Response videos are made by YouTubers of one political valance (typically conservative, right-wing, or members of the so-called “Intellectual Dark Web”; see Lewis 2018) as a form of rebuttal to videos made by YouTubers of an opposing political valance. They selectively edit and respond to the claims of the videos, critiquing both its political propositions and levying personal attacks against its host. Often, these attacks serve to delegitimize the target as irrational or immoral, while simultaneously positioning the broadcaster as rational. Moreover, this remix of existing and original content enrolls the “target” into a kind of staged or simulated debate, reframing what might have otherwise looked like a monologue (or, less generously, a rant) as a back-and-forth exchange between committed interlocutors. This content structure interpellates the target as if they were already defending themselves from accusations from the response video’s creator. Through a content analysis of fourteen representative response videos, we expect to argue that these videos are complicit in constructing conditions in which harassment flourishes.\n","Abstract Body: Research on gender-related byline biases, e.g. in how far media audiences perceive media messages from male and female authors differently, has led to ambiguous findings. This study focuses on the impact of an author’s gender on readers’ intentions to engage with news articles dealing with gender-related topics. We expand existing research by linking byline biases with backlash effects and by investigating the role of emotion prescriptions targeting gender emotion norms. We report findings from two consecutive studies (paper-pencil, study 1 and an online survey, study 2), each employing a 2 (byline male/female) x 2 (manipulation of emotion norm) experimental design focusing on the case of articles on gender issues. While results did not point to a main effect of byline bias on article engagement and author credibility, we found partial support for backlash attitudes moderating this relationship. For the impact of emotion prescription, findings remain ambiguous, opening the ground for future research in this domain.\n","Abstract Body: This study provides an important update on the portrayal of teens in popular films from 2016, 2017, 2018. Systematic quantitative analyses of media content enables media researchers to make broad-scale claims about the type and quality of messages offered by the media. The following research questions guided the collection of data (which has been completed): 1) Who are the teens that populate that popular films, and what types of activities do they engage in? 2) How common are risk-taking behaviors, including substance use and sexual activity, among teen characters, and what consequences are depicted? 3) How do current portrayals of teens in popular films compare with those from decades past?<br />(Extended abstract submitted as PDF).\n","Abstract Body: Extant media effects research suggests that affirmative media portrayals of underrepresented groups may positively affect social judgments and increase support for social issues related to these groups. However, this research has primarily focused on portrayals of racial/ethnic minorities, thus excluding many other underrepresented groups (e.g., transgender individuals). To address this shortcoming, the current set of studies presents a content analysis of representations of transgender performers in scripted television programming and correlation data to examine the effects of mediated contact with transgender television characters and subsequent evaluations among cis-gender audiences. Preliminary results indicate that transgender women and white transgender performers are represented more often than transgender men and transgender people of color, respectively. Also, transgender performers are more often portrayed as a lower social class in scripted television programming. Results from correlation data reveal that cis-audiences exposure to television transgender characters increases favorable judgments of social issues related to the transgender community (i.e., trans serving in the military).\n","Abstract Body: Communicating about risks of tobacco products is increasingly complicated as diverse tobacco products in the market now may present less harm than traditional cigarettes. Tobacco companies have submitted modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) applications to the FDA seeking authorization to market their products with “reduced risk claims” (RRCs). However, the studies supporting the applications were deficient in many ways. Our research addressing the problem manipulated several language features of RRCs in the advertisements of IQOS, a heated tobacco product recently launched in the US, to evaluate their effects on consumers’ understanding of complete switching and product risk perceptions. We found that any ads with RRCs regardless of the language feature lowered perceived IQOS risk. This effect was present even for diseases that were not in the RRCs, indicating that RRCs might mislead consumers. Explaining what “switching completely” means reduced misperceptions that complete switching is compatible with continued smoking. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the persuasiveness of message framing (gain vs. loss) and type of evidence (exemplary vs. statistical) in prosocial campaigns. We investigated the idea that individuals respond differently to these two message strategies depending on their level of empathic concern (EC). Empathic concern describes the trait tendency to feel compassion for others in need. The results of an experiment with 214 participants largely support our hypotheses. Individuals with lower empathic concern reported a more favorable message attitude when exposed to exemplary evidence and held a more favorable attitude toward the advocacy when exposed to a loss frame. In contrast, individuals with higher empathic concern were equally persuaded by exemplary and statistical evidence as well as by gain and loss frames. Implications for prosocial campaigns are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Charity advertising has gained increasing attention from scholars and practitioners in various fields. It provides a robust venue for exploring gain versus loss framing effects. Despite the accumulation of substantial research in this area, no meta-analysis has been undertaken. This project seeks to fill this gap. A meta-analysis of 27 studies (<i>k <\/i>= 40, <i>N <\/i>= 9,298) finds that gain-framed and loss-framed appeals do not differ significantly on persuasiveness in charity advertising. The random-effects model reveals a mean <i>r<\/i> of .002 (95% CI -.061–.064, <i>p<\/i> = .96) after correcting for sampling and measurement errors. A re-analysis (<i>k<\/i> = 38) excluding two outliers yielded a mean <i>r<\/i> of .03 (95% CI -.022–.073, <i>p<\/i> = .29). Among published studies (<i>k<\/i> = 32), there was tentative indication pointing to the slight advantage of gain-framed appeals. The framing effect does not differ by which type of donation the message calls for (monetary vs. organ), nor is it affected by moderators such as study setting and population. The little difference finding echoes previous conceptual and empirical work and calls for more work identifying moderating factors and boundary conditions on framing research. Practical implications and future directions are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The rise of social media has positioned message retransmission as a primary mechanism to produce campaign exposure. Two original experiments were carried out to test the causal impacts of moral appeals on the intentions to retransmit pictorial anti-smoking messages (PASMs). Findings consistently supported the power of care-based moral appeals in motivating both broadcasting and narrowcasting intentions; in contrast, purity-based PASMs produced null effects. Furthermore, the retransmission-boosting effects of care-based PASMs persisted even with a disparaging virtual climate of opinions, were stronger for individuals with higher endorsement of the care/harm moral foundation, and were mediated by the motive for morality expression and the activation of general moral thinking above and beyond a battery of known psychological mechanisms driving retransmission. These results provided the first set of experimental evidence demonstrating that moral appeals could drive retransmission in the context of online strategic communication, while highlighting the importance of moral pluralism.<br />\n","Abstract Body: While past studies have revealed how dehumanization can lead to the development of anti-refugee attitudes, fewer studies have examined how the effects of dehumanization vary based on dehumanization through appearance versus dehumanization through emotion. Likewise, many studies have been conducted using news media portrayals of refugees, but fewer have examined the impact of fictional refugee portrayals from entertainment media. An online experiment (<i>N <\/i>= 1, 749) was conducted that tested the effect of refugee portrayals that were either non-human in appearance but sympathetic, non-human in appearance and hostile, or human in appearance and sympathetic relative to a no exposure baseline. Results revealed that a non-human portrayal that was hostile increased negative attitudes towards refugees, while real world portrayals that were sympathetic increased positive attitudes and reduced stereotyping of refugees. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: In addition to presenting a synthesis of the existing framing literature, this paper introduces a framing-counterframing theory (FCT). A conceptual distinction is made between frames that define an issue as a problem, and counterframes that deproblematize the issue. The results of an experimental study into the effects of an awareness-raising campaign on child poverty demonstrate how such a campaign can be more effective by using counterframing. Further, the results signal how the internal coherence of a frame can be broken by priming an alternative problematizing frame that mitigates the intended effect. A discussion follows on how FCT can enrich our understanding of the construction of social reality.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the intrinsic psychological motives that underscore individuals’ decisions to share misinformation on social media. A 2 (personal relevance: low vs. high) x 2 (anxiety: low vs. high) x 2 (news source credibility: low vs. high) x 2 (dispute one news: absent vs. present) x 2 (need for self-validation: no or yes) factorial online experiment was conducted. Findings suggest individuals share misinformation for self-protection and self-enhancement. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Although fake news stories spread through various media, little is known about which media have agenda-setting power for fake news. This study examines the direction of intermedia agenda-setting of fake news between social media and news media by analyzing five fake news stories published on Twitter, Reddit, and online news media between 2018 and 2019. The results show that the direction of intermedia agenda-setting between Twitter and news media is reciprocal, and Reddit follows the news media agenda in all five fake news stories. Our findings imply that although social media can influence news media agendas due to the fake news story’s biased and controversial nature, the agenda-setting power of social media may vary depending on social media platform characteristics.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The novel affordances and unique features on social media have transformed the way people assess public opinion. Drawing on the spiral of silence (SOS) theory, this study examines the roles that user-generated comments (UGCs) and aggregated user representations (AURs), represented by reaction emojis, play in shaping perceptions of the opinion climate. It also investigates how features on the platform trigger perceptions of source credibility to influence willingness to speak out. Results from a 3 (opinion cues: UGCs-only vs. AURs-only vs. UGCs-and-AURs) x 2 (opinion climate congruency: congruent vs. incongruent) x 2 (source credibility: high vs. low) between-subjects experimental design revealed that audiences perceived reaction emojis to reflect public opinion. Source credibility was found to affect willingness to speak out and moderate opinion climate congruency. The findings extend the SOS theory by highlighting the significant role that novel affordances have on SOS components operating online. Implications of the findings were discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Accuracy of people’s perceptions about polling effects has been controversial. There have been several attempts to test accuracy of media effect perceptions, but no study systematically tested whether individuals underestimate/overestimate the effect of opinion poll results on themselves and other citizens. In on online survey on a controversial domestic issue (N = 496), we tested the biases in perceptions of opinion polling effects by comparing perceived amount of attitude change with the actual amount of attitude change due to exposure to opinion poll results. Attitudes toward an existent social issue were measured before and after exposure to poll results. Perceived amounts of attitude change of the self and others by the poll results were also measured. Respondents were found to underestimate the polling effect on the self when they are swayed by the majority opinion in the poll. On the other hand, respondents overestimated polling effect on others regardless of the impact of the poll results on their preexisting attitude. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines longitudinal agenda-setting effects among news media, opinion leaders, and the public on Twitter issue networks. This study chose US immigration as a case study because it is controversial on Twitter. Based on the results of social network analysis identifying opinion leaders, this study conducted Granger causality tests to measure longitudinal agenda-setting effects. The results showed a mixture of top-down and bottom-up agenda-setting effects, extending our understanding of opinion leadership.\n","Abstract Body: The presentation of single cases as examples for larger phenomena has a long-standing tradition in journalism. However, their usage has been viewed rather critically within the scientific community because they are employed in a highly selective manner. Consequently, over the course of the last three decades, communication scholars from different research traditions have concerned themselves with the question of how single-case information within media content affects audience judgments. Although most publications report exemplification effects of some sort, it remains unclear which types of exemplars are effective, and whether they are capable of influencing both perceptual and personal judgments. Applying a multi-level meta-regression approach, we synthesize findings across different studies and investigate potential moderators. Our results suggest overall exemplification effects that seem to be most pronounced for first-level reality judgments, such as public opinion or frequency estimates, but that are limited in their robustness when controlling for interdependence of the measurements.\n","Abstract Body: Building on the work of Holbert and Park (2019), the current paper identifies several weaknesses in the analyzing, reporting, and evaluating of moderation in mass communication research and offers remedies for these ailments. A human-based content analysis of a cluster sample of published works (<i>N<\/i> = 750) appearing in 15 journals (i.e., 50 articles per outlet) from 2016 through 2018 has been conducted to assess the current state of analyzing, reporting, and evaluating moderation in mass communication research.\n","Abstract Body: This paper addresses epistemological issues in the area of media effects research. In the first section it is argued that the field hinges on conflicting notions of science and lacks a shared epistemic outlook. The second section tries to address this gap by conceptualizing media effects as a Lakatosian research programme. It is shown that Lakatos’ framework is amenable to describe the history and practices of the field, and that it helps us evaluate the current state of the literature. In particular, it is concluded that effects research resembles a degenerative research programme. The third section of the paper takes this argument as a sign to reconsider how the field operates. Four epistemic commitments for effects scholars are put forward: (1) conduct reproducible and replicable research, (2) establish conceptual definitions, (3) make progressive use of the field’s positive heuristic, and (4) rely on a severe testing account of statistical inference.\n","Abstract Body: The purpose of this study is to analyze media representation of the gig economy. Using a stratified sampling method, articles were selected from top U.S. newspapers (<i>n<\/i> = 220). First, thematic analysis and a review of the literature identified key themes in the articles. Then, two coders were trained in the process of content analysis and coded the sample. The findings of this study suggest trends in the presentation of gig work as lacking social protections, being associated with low pay, and most commonly being synonymous with the “Uberization” of labor. This study provides important benchmarks for understanding how media cover freelance labor.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates factors predicting news sharing on social media in the election context. Specifically, the current study examines how users’ six motivations for news sharing and the structural composition of information they are exposed to predict their news sharing behaviors. Analyses of national survey data collected before the 2018 U.S. midterm election (<i>N<\/i> = 1,977) suggest that criticism, informing, and socialization motivations, but not expression, awareness, and self-presentation motivations, positively predict news sharing on social media. At the structural level, individuals are more likely to share news when they are exposed to information that is disagreeable rather than agreeable. This relationship is stronger among individuals with higher epistemic political efficacy and lower political knowledge.\n","Abstract Body: Extended Abstract\n","Abstract Body: Abstract<br /> <br />The increasingly assertive position of social media as a news source means that news audiences no longer depend on traditional journalists for determining information authenticity. Instead, they must navigate their ways around the myriad of information, verified and otherwise, that they are exposed to online. The majority of information credibility studies have considered information evaluation as a purely cognitive and non-normative endeavor, with the implication that individuals can arrive at valid information without social validation. By drawing on self-categorization theory, this article re-conceptualizes audiences’ acts of news authentication by shifting the focus from a micro-level individualistic approach to the social process. This study considers news authentication not as a one-off activity under the uncontested control of the individual, but as a cycle of collective authentication strategies whereby individual authentication and social validation are entangled in the fluid and context-dependent processing of social news. To do this, we examined news authentication as a social process by looking at the motivation, strategies, as well as the social consequences that support it through a series of focus group discussions in Singapore.<br /> <br />\n","Abstract Body: As concerns about news credibility and trust continue to mount, research can address how to improve perceptions of news and engender more mindful news consumption. News literacy (NL) interventions are one possible solution to improving perceptions of news credibility, while reducing perceptions of news hostility. To test this idea, we embedded NL messages on a simulated news aggregator website featuring a range of political news stories to affect perceptions of news credibility and hostility and actual news selection behaviors measured using website analytics. Our results suggest the NL messages were successful in making the website look more credible, but did not reduce perceptions of website hostility nor increase story selection. We also examine partisan differences to explore selective exposure and avoidance in the context of a political news site.\n","Abstract Body: Online comments posted on news stories offer democratic potential for political discussions and civic empowerment, as well as business and journalistic value as they give the audience a place to engage. Yet, comment sections also can attract incivility and trolling. Newsrooms perform a gatekeeping role by having journalists review comments in advance and reject for publication comments that appear abusive or uncivil. Similarly, newsreaders perform a gatewatching role by flagging comments they deem as abusive or uncivil in hopes the newsroom will remove the comments. We explore whether journalists and newsreaders focus their gatekeeping and gatewatching attentions on different topics in news comment sections. To investigate this subject, we run a series of topic models on news comment threads that include/do not include comments flagged as abusive by newsreaders and on news comment threads that include/do not include comments that have been rejected by journalists. These analyses will (a) uncover the topics that occur most frequently in the different types of comment threads and (b) test whether the comment threads that include comments rejected by journalists produce similar types of topics to those produced in the threads with at least one comment flagged as abusive by news readers.\n","Abstract Body: Social groups such as political parties, sports teams or interest groups are often covered in the news. This news coverage may provide information that is relevant to the social identity of group members and thus initiate social identity processes. We suggest that negative and positive news coverage about social groups affect group members’ self-esteem and perception of news coverage. To investigate effects on collective self-esteem, hostile media, and third-person perceptions we manipulated news articles to threaten or boost the social identity of political party members. Results show some evidence that the effects of positive and negative news coverage are dependent on how strongly an individual is identified with the respective social group. Our results imply that although critical coverage on democratic institutions is one of the media’s key functions in democratic societies, it might backfire and increase political polarization in society.\n","Abstract Body: Scholars and commentators have observed a “discourse of derision” thought to characterize much of the news coverage of the U.S. education system, but the contours of this discourse are not well understood. This article pairs quantitative content analysis with qualitative framing analysis to sharpen the conceptual and empirical focus of the discourse of derision as a construct. We theorize four components of this discourse—tone, assessments of quality, teacher voice, and criticism of teachers—and analyze them in a representative sample (<i>n<\/i> = 602) of broadcast television evening news stories from 1990-2015. Our findings reveal that the discourse of derision is a common but not overwhelming feature of television news, occurring primarily through negativity in tone and assessments of quality.\n","Abstract Body: This paper reviews the controversial relationship of entertainment and political communication and presents a theoretical framework to integrate seemingly contradicting concepts and research findings. On the one hand, concerns have been raised about the decay of news quality and political culture due to the growing influence of entertainment media. On the other, researchers have highlighted the potential of entertainment in terms of audience interest, cognitive accessibility, and public outreach. A literature overview shows theoretical and empirical support for both sides of the controversy about the (dys-)functionality of entertainment in political communication. Therefore, in an attempt to reconcile the divergent findings, the paper presents an extended dual-process model of entertainment effects on political information processing and engagement. This framework offers substantial extensions to existing dual-process models of entertainment by conceptualizing the effects of entertainment on different forms of political engagement that have not been incorporated so far.\n","Abstract Body: As a leading form of communication between candidates and prospective voters, political advertisements have become a staple for elections. Given that recent scholarship emphasizes the increased use of narratives in political advertising, this research considers theoretical approaches informed by the study of narratives to investigate how viewers derive pleasure and meaning from such messages. A 3 (sponsorship) × 2 (issue) mixed factorial design was employed to test the effects of congruence between sponsorship – a political advertisement sponsored by a Democratic candidate, Republican candidate, and non-partisan organization  – and voters’ party affiliation on self-reported enjoyment and appreciation of the advertisement, real-time emotions elicited during message exposure determined by facial action coding, and visual attention on the screen captured via a remote eye tracking sensor. These physiological responses were examined as potential predictors of viewers’ voting preference. Results indicated that negative and mixed emotions and time spent on the screen were predicted by advertisement congruence and issue involvement. Appreciation and enjoyment of the advertisement and positive emotions elicited during message exposure predicted voting decision. Implications for the consistency between sponsorship of a political advertisement and viewers’ party affiliation on affective, cognitive, and behavioral responses are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Research on thought-provoking effects of eudaimonic entertainment experiences shows that some types of fictional content can stimulate elaborate forms of cognitive processing and encourage political outcomes such as topic interest and further information seeking. Based on dual process models of entertainment (Bartsch & Schneider, 2014; Oliver & Raney, 2011) and the LC4MP (Lang, 2006), we argue that these thought-provoking effects are facilitated, when more cognitive resources are available to the audience during processing. We conduct an experiment using a 2 (low vs. high cognitive load) × 3 (topic) design. Non-student participants are recruited using a commercial panel. This study will contribute to research on dual process models of entertainment and on entertainment content’s potential to reach a wider audience for political issues.\n","Abstract Body: As social media grew in popularity and became more integrated with televised media over the last 15 years, scholars have noted a shift in how people, especially younger generational groups, participate in politics in ways that cross media platforms (Diehl, Barnidge & Gil de Zúñiga, 2019). This has paralleled the rise of new satire as a journalistic form, typified by <i>The Daily Show<\/i>, <i>The Colbert Report<\/i>, <i>Real Time with Bill Maher<\/i>, and more recently, <i>Last Week Tonight with John Oliver<\/i> (Lichter, Baumgartner & Morris, 2014). The intersection of news satire and social media is best seen when hosts encourage audiences to discuss topics covered on the program, sponsoring hashtags to move the prompted discussion to social media platforms (Giglietto & Selva, 2014).<br />Comedians like Bill Maher and Jon Stewart built their programs on a long tradition of satirizing journalism and commenting on contemporary society; beginning with Mark Twain and continuing to this day with Saturday Night Live, many writers and comedians have employed journalistic forms for satirical purposes (Baym & Jones, 2013). By making the information more relatable and understandable for the pubic, the modern incarnation of news satire has generated large audiences and produced media effects (Hoffman & Young, 2011). One of the most obvious behaviors that these programs prompt is discussion and social sharing on platforms like Twitter and Facebook, as clips, quotes, and hashtags features in the program recirculate.<br />Social media outlets like Twitter and Facebook provide a fast, wide-reaching, platform for discourse spurred by these programs. Social media platforms allow hosts and correspondents to communicate more closely with their audience. In the last decade, networks like Comedy Central and HBO have actively tried to encourage extending the program experience to ongoing social media interaction. Notably, these same programs have sought to foster immediate reactions to onscreen content through second screening and the promotion of hashtags.<br />Second screening, watching broadcast media while also interacting about that content on second web-accessible screen, has spiked at the intersection of politics and commentary (Giglietto & Selva, 2014; Shah et al., 2015). Whether through laptops, tablets, or smartphones, the second screen serves as an access point to a worldwide pool of conversations where individuals can connect to share their perspectives, reactions, and knowledge. Second screening is regularly encouraged in today’s media, with programs working to bolster engagement with professional and collegiate sports, popular entertainment, talk shows, and campaign events.<br />With regard to late night talk shows and news satire programs, second screening offers insights about the opinions of media consumers as they extend the broadcast experience, commenting on politics and public affairs. Sharing messages about contentious topics around common objects like a prompted hashtag facilitates communication among the highly engaged audiences of these programs. Hashtags allow users to organize their thoughts on a given topic, readily locating others’ messages relating to a specific theme or community (Small, 2011). In the past few years, hashtags have been used to organize longer lasting movements like that of #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo. But many hashtags are much more ephemeral.<br />Political satirists like John Oliver use hashtags to provoke audiences to react to his humorous take on political issues, contemporary controversies, or his personal observations such as the Senate’s failure to consider a Supreme Court nominee (#DogGarland), the fact that the CIA has a twitter account (#BetterCIATweeets), and, the focus of this paper, Donald Trump’s immigration policies (#MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain). The questions I set out to answer center on examining the nature of the discourse prompted by these virtual calls to action and understanding the characteristics of the accounts producing these messages:<br />RQ1: What are the themes that emerge around the hash-tagged posts prompted by John Oliver’s call to action on Last Week Tonight?<br />RQ2: What is the relationship of the features of accounts (followers, friends, and bio content) with the features of the posts containing the John Oliver prompted hashtags?<br />Methods<br />For this project, I use a 10% sample of all Tweets drawn from a Twitter archive for the three month period following the original airing of each episode containing the promoted hashtag. Given space limitations of an extended abstract, I focus on the #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain hashtag that emerged from an episode critiquing Donald Trump, his brand, and his proposed immigration policies by showing how Trump’s ancestors changed the family name from Drumpf to anglicized it. I examine the nature of the political conversation taking place on Twitter under this hashtag using two computational text analysis tools, LIWC and Leximancer.<br />Leximancer is a text analysis tool used for extract themes from a corpus of documents (e.g. tweets) and visualize these themes and their interconnections in conceptual map “that provides a bird’s eye view of the material, representing the main concepts contained within the text as well as information about how they are related” (Leximancer, 2018, p. 3). It was used to analyze all tweets drawn from our archive containing the #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain hashtag and optimize the visual mapping of the emergent themes. LIWC, or Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, is another text analysis program.  It traces the presence of emotional, cognitive, and structural components and calculates the degree to which various categories of words are present (Pennebaker, Boyd, Jordan & Blackburn, 2015). LIWC was used to score each tweet containing the #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain hashtag.  This content was scored for the following validated LIWC categories: Analytical Thinking, Clout, Authenticity, and Emotional Tone, along with Word Count (WC) and Words per Sentence (WPS). (For detailed descriptions of these categories, see Pennebaker et al., 2015)<br />Results and Discussion<br />To analyze these data using Leximancer, I first removed words that would otherwise overshadow the data I was seeking to map (e.g., commercial appeals). Next, I edited the number of concepts included, eliminating redundancy from the resulting map. I structured the remaining categories in a conceptual map with 8 key themes composed of 34 total concepts (see Figure 1).<br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This visualization indicates that the main conversation centered on the hashtag involved: (1) tweeting at John Oliver and Donald Trump’s personal accounts, (2) critiquing Trump with slogans such as #DumpTrump and #NeverTrump, and (3) advocating for another candidate, specifically Bernie Sanders (i.e., #FeelTheBern). It is notable that twitter users combined the prompted hashtag of #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain with other form of political mobilization via hashtag, or engaged in driect online interactions with Donald Trump’s account.  Both are forms of online political participation.  More important, the theme of global origin, family, and American engage with the program’s topic of Trumps own family lineage and the welcoming of immigrants.<br />Next, regression analysis using the LIWC scores examined the language used in the hashtagged tweet and related it to features of the account that posted the tweet. This included Follower Count (total number of users following the tweeter at time of the tweet), Friend Count (total number of users the tweeter followed at time of the tweet), if the account was verified (indicates authentic user of public interest), along with the categories mentioned above. I found that tweets with higher word count and more words per sentence were linked to accounts with lower follower counter and higher friend counts, suggesting  “longwinded” users were less popular. Second, posts with more Clout originated from accounts that used more positive tone in their profile bio. Last, users who employed more authentic language in their tweets were linked to a lower following to follower ratio, suggesting greater status or importance.<br />These results show that social media outlets like Twitter aid in the organization and facilitation of communication; allow interaction between people with similar and differing views; and provide a faster, wide-reaching, platform for discourse and debate. When used by hosts on networks like Comedy Central, TBS, and HBO that combine comedy and politics, these hashtags have the potential to shape political conversation. The insights provided about the intersection between news satire and social media is key to understanding the changing nature of news and talk.<br />References<br />Baym, G., & Jones, J. P. (2013).

There is however little work exploring the potential connection between entertainment programming and political sorting. This paper uses Nielsen data to explore entertainment media selection from 2001 to 2016 and finds increasing differentiation in the shows watched in primarily Democratic versus primarily Republican markets. The results are considered in light of work on political polarization and sorting, and on the political relevance of entertainment programming.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The spiral of silence theory, as made prominent by Noelle-Neumann, has long been criticized because it only takes the fear of isolation as an explanatory factor and may not sustain in a new media environment. This study addresses these criticisms by including positive motivations and testing their effect on social media and offline. 418 survey responses were collected via the Qualtrics online panel. The results of SEM show that the variable of perceived positive response mediates the relationship between outspokenness on social media and the following: opinion congruence, narcissism, and political efficacy; perceived negative response mediates the relationship between outspokenness offline and the following: narcissism, political efficacy, and moral basis. Findings suggest that the fear of isolation is not the exclusive factor determining people’s willingness to speak out, but rather, different motivations trigger outspokenness in different situations.\n","Abstract Body: Using the theoretical frameworks of spiral of silence and social loafing, this study proposed a parallel mechanism to explain why people always defend their stances on controversial sociopolitical issues such as gun control. Specifically, a 2 (a person’s own stance: support gun control vs. oppose gun control) × 3 (Instagram commenters’ stances: majority support gun control vs. majority oppose gun control vs. balanced opinions) between-subjects experiment was conducted to test the mediating effect of <i>feeling of being in the majority opinion group<\/i> and <i>feeling of others not contributing enough<\/i> on boycott (i.e., purposely avoiding purchasing a brand) and buycott (i.e., purposely purchasing a brand) intentions. The experimental results showed that people tend to defend their own stances by taking boycott/buycott actions towards a company, primarily due to their feeling of being in the majority opinion group.\n","Abstract Body: This study connects the social psychological rationales underlying the spiral of silence (SoS) and social capital theory to, plausibly, provide the first comprehensive investigation on how users’ perception of different types of social capital networks (bonding, bridging, and maintained) would affect individual expression on social media. Specifically, a bi-mediation moderated model linking different social capital types to individual expression likelihood via perceived self-network opinion incongruity (i.e., mediation) and fear of social isolation (FoSI) (i.e., mediation, moderation) was posited and tested. Findings from a sample of 1,086 Internet users reveal that users perceive social capital networks on social networking sites (SNSs) in the three distinct dimensions, with perceived bridging capital being the strongest predictor of individual expression. Users’ perception of bridging and maintained capital networks was found to heighten their fear of being socially isolated from the online networks, whereas perceived bonding capital do not lead to significant levels of isolation fear. Notably, the more users perceive their networks to comprise members of bonding capital, the more they perceive their opinions to be incongruent with the networks. Additionally, contrary to SoS’s prediction, FoSI was found to positively relate to individual expression likelihood on SNS.  Discussion elaborated on the tension between users’ need to nurture social connections and the ‘psychological freedom’ to express themselves on SNSs; plausibly helping to explain users’ migration to different SNS platforms for the accumulation of different social capital networks.\n","Abstract Body: The topic of sexual violence has received significant attention in recent years through both the public and media agendas. This study revisits a 2014 study using the backdrop of the #Metoo movement to examine the role of social media, views of rape culture and bystander intervention in predicting one’s willingness to engage in collective action against sexual violence. A survey of young adults conducted in Fall 2019 found that with recent attention to sexual misconduct, the likelihood to engage in collective action against it remains strong—perhaps stronger than before #Metoo. Results indicated that bystander intervention remained a key predictor, but that awareness of the #me too movement appeared to counteract the views on rape culture in predicting collective action. Media engagement was insignificant in this analysis. Implications for scholars and practitioners were discussed.\n","Abstract Body: In the present study we hypothesized that sexualizing media exposure, through traditional media and social media, would predict attitudes toward sexual consent, harassment, and assault through the mediating variables of self-objectification and endorsement of heterosexual scripts. We conducted a two-wave panel study of 302 college students with a three-month lag between waves. We tested two three-stage path models, which differed for men and women. From the traditional media model, we found that women’s music video exposure predicted less favorable attitudes about sexual consent. Music video and reality television exposure were also associated with women’s rape myth acceptance, sexual harassment tolerance, and less favorable consent attitudes indirectly through self-objectification. Women who attended college party-oriented events and who watched music videos and reality television exhibited higher endorsement of heterosexual scripts and self-objectification. From the social media model, we found that women’s Snapchat use predicted lower self-objectification, but for men, Instagram use predicted both higher self-objectification and sexual harassment tolerance indirectly through self-objectification. Our results have implications for college students’ sexualizing culture through mediated portrayals.\n","Abstract Body: -> see Extended Abstract\n","Abstract Body: Utilizing a comprehensive effects model in which gratifications sought (GS) and gratifications obtained (GO) interact to influence three different engagement outcomes--collaboration, content creation, and real-life behaviors, we found strong associations between GS and these outcomes. Results from survey data (n = 298) showed that Americans and Chinese users keen on maintaining their existing relationships tended to engage more in TikTok, a smartphone short video sharing app. Relational initiation (making new connections) and affection (expression of concern and friendliness) were significantly different between users in the two countries. As one of the first TikTok studies, these results provide a theoretical framework for future researchers and marketers interested in studying and reaching the trend-setting users of this fastest-growing teenage-friendly mobile app in both countries.\n","Abstract Body: Guided by the influence of presumed influence hypothesis, this study examines how individuals develop presumptions about the impact of uncivil comments on others and align their behaviors with these presumptions. The results from an online experiment indicate that incivility reduces the perceived social desirability of user comments, which promotes a presumed impact of uncivil comments on others’ flaming intention and subsequently increases the likelihood of support for comment censorship and engagement in comment moderation. The theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The Internet has not only helped promote public discourses and civic life; it has also amplified incivility online, often leading to a greater degree of polarization and cynicism in public opinions. Much of existing research on online incivility focuses on documenting the prevalence of uncivil behaviors in the digital space, rather than on detailing the process of how incivility evolves. This study examined the mechanisms that underlie an \"\"incivility spiral\"\"—how online swearing spreads as a function of mimicry and reciprocation. A total of 28,506 original posts and 1,126,455 related replies were collected from the HKGolden forum—Hong Kong’s most popular online discussion forum in the studied period—to investigate the contagion of swearing in discussion of mainland China-related issues in the aftermath of Umbrella Movement (UM). The post-UM period witnessed the intensification of mainland China-Hong Kong conflict which had created intense tensions, often giving an impression that Hong Kongers are behaving more uncivilly and radically both offline and online. Using combined approaches of topic modeling and computerized text analysis, this study empirically tested and compared three mechanisms: direct mimicry (i.e., imitating the action of the original poster), third party influence (i.e., imitating the action of preceding repliers), and generalized reciprocity (i.e., reciprocating the action of other users). Third party influence shows the largest predictive effect, followed by generalized reciprocity and direct mimicry. The findings show how the interactive usage of swear words in the online discussion of a highly controversial issue form into an incivility spiral and the secondary spirals that can result.\n","Abstract Body: This research investigated the hostile media perception (HMP) focusing on the interaction between sources and content. We proposed three possible interaction patterns and tested moderation of the interaction. The online experiment which manipulated source (<i>Fox News<\/i> vs. <i>CNN<\/i>) and content (pro-Trump vs. anti-Trump) was conducted. The effects of source and content were confirmed respectively. Moreover, a negative interaction was found and it was moderated by political ideology strength and need for cognition. Implications were discussed.\n",null,"Abstracts: This presentation looks at two independent movie distribution companies that eventually joined Hollywood, New Line Cinema and Netflix.  Although these companies functioned differently and in distinct historical contexts, they illustrate some of the features that distinguish independence in the distribution sector of the movie business.<br /> <br />New Line and Netflix both suggest how the innovations of independent distributors can serve the larger movie industry. In the 1980s, New Line Cinema exhibited traits typical of independent film distributors, releasing an eclectic slate of modestly-budgeted genre movies and gaining financial support by selling films’ international distribution rights. Yet strategies like these made the company appealing to media conglomerates looking to diversify in the 1990s. The case of Netflix, which joined the MPAA in January 2019, differs greatly but still shows how an independent distributor innovated within the industry, as the other Hollywood studios increasingly look to internet distribution for revenue. <br />\n","Abstracts: Independent television has meant many things, likely as a result of the varied national norms and experiences of television that have created different structures of dominance and hegemony to which “independent” television is likely to respond. The most common definition – in terms of policy and scholarship – has understood independence as a way to categorize production companies unaffiliated with the network or channel that finances a significant amount of the cost of production of a series it then airs. Independent television lacks the discursive significance common to independent film and music and thus provides a valuable contrast. This paper explores the outcome of British policy interventions aimed at expanding independent television and how internet-distributed television has increased vertical integration, to the detriment of independence. It queries whether the connotation of independence has misdirected policy initiatives and how more sophisticated examinations of media ownership might produce more effective policy.\n","Abstracts: Through a historical look at the video games industry from the 1990s to the early 2000s, this presentation investigates the growth and legitimation of major companies, such as Nintendo, and examines how these industrial shifts impacted what it meant to be a “game developer” both professionally and in the cultural imagination.<br /> <br />The consolidation of the development process during the 90s across the major video game industry players helps bring into focus how industry practices sought to define and delimit a legitimate way develop games. This helps explain the rise of “independent” or “indie” game development as a strategic response to this industrially legitimate way of developing games. As such, the often-nebulous, difficult to define “indie” label claimed by many development studios today can be understood as a discursive move, but also a way of marking separation from—and therefore, the recognition of—certain industrial characteristics of the larger, corporate studios.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Based on archival research and interviews, the study examines how China’s photography industry responded to the country’s profound sociopolitical shift from the late 1970s to the 1980s. It argues that, with a more open political and economic system in post-Mao China, the photography industry, once embedded within the state apparatus for direct social control, was brought to the “third realm”, a space between state and society, and developed into a third-realm institution to organize group activities, provide technical training, and generate a sense of community. Ultimately, it helped to guide individual taste and behavior. The collaboration between state and society resulted in two major concerns within Chinese photography: propaganda and aestheticism. As the industry expanded, disagreements with and diversions from these two concerns, as exemplified in the case of the Photographic New Wave of 1980s, were contained within the “third realm.”\n","Abstract Body: Music copyright reform has been a major policy objective in China in recent years. Copyright enforcement expansion has helped to grow the Chinese music industry to a global leader but has sparked some controversy among the Chinese general public. Copyright reform often leads to polarized debates between competing interests. These debates are shaped by discourse among state bodies, industry actors, and the general public. This study investigates music copyright discourse in China by analyzing six years of media coverage and public posts on two widely used Chinese platforms: 1) <i>People’s Daily, <\/i>as a proxy for the state; and 2) WeChat, as a proxy for the Chinese public. We identify actors, topics, and sentiments relating to music copyright in China during a period of vast copyright reform and expansion. This study addresses a gap in the growing body of literature on copyright discourse and cultural regulation that focus primarily on Western contexts. Moreover, we employ empirically rigorous computational methods to take a novel approach to studying copyright discourses in networked public spaces.\n","Abstract Body: This article explores how entrepreneurs in the Chinese digital game industry initiate their venture creation by investigating the relationship between their social capital and key steps of identifying entrepreneurial opportunities in the pre-market entry stage: opportunity recognition and opportunity evaluation. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 33 gaming entrepreneurs in Shanghai, the findings show that social capital plays a minor role in their recognition of opportunities, whereas it substantially affects their opportunity evaluation. Besides, these entrepreneurs adopt varied approaches to accessing and mobilizing social capital given their situated industry sectors. Those focus on commercial game product/service prioritize specific professional relations while those on indie and fledgling game product/service rely more on extended ones. Such a difference in networking practice is subject to the industry’s overarching dynamics.\n","Abstract Body: A growing number of private Chinese media companies have reached the economic scale comparable to established Western media conglomerates, providing a fertile ground to revisit and revise media theories developed in the Western context. However, little research discusses the rise and fall of Chinese private media companies, despite their growing importance and ambitious global expansion. Drawing on network theory and the political economy approach, we use publicly available financial documents and an archive of more than 3,000 newspaper articles to examine how Dalian Wanda Group - once the most dynamic media conglomerate in China - builds and exercises its switching power in the network society and its limitations. This article makes theoretical contributions by using Wanda to showcase the potential and plight of private-owned Chinese media firms and the extent to which Castells’ network society can be applied to a non-western context. Our case study based on network analysis illustrates the development and deployment of network power in the rapidly growing and changing Chinese media industries, focusing on vertical control exerted by the nation state and horizontal influence of global media corporations. On the one hand, results confirm Castells’ network society theory that Wanda functions as a switcher at the intersection of multiple business, political, and media networks, accumulating impressive economic power to amass horizontal influence in and beyond the Chinese market as well as some leverage when negotiating/bargaining with local Chinese governments for favorable policy treatment and lucrative economic returns. On the other hand, Wanda’s switching power is fragile as its vertical control at the national level is constrained and contingent on the extent to which it aligns with the interest of the Chinese state. When Wanda’s global expansion was perceived as no longer being in sync with the Chinese state’s soft power pursuit, its switching power was marginalized. Wanda thus offers an interesting case that contradicts and extends the primacy of the switcher as described by Castells (1998, 2004, 2010).\n","Abstract Body: Wanghong, short for “wangluo hongren”, is the Chinese term for “people who have gone viral on the internet” and is usually used as the vernacular term for influencers and microcelebrities in Chinese market, highlighting their acute ability to convert internet viewer traffic to money with replicable and profitable economic models (Abidin, 2018; Zhang & de Seta, 2019; Han, 2019). With the high-profile case of Papi Jiang, a witty, skeptical video uploader who successfully monetizing her online popularity by selling her first video advertisement at the price of $3.4 million in April 2016 (Yu, 2016), year 2016 was recognized “Year One of Wanghong Economy” by mainstream media outlets in China including Xinhua News (Ye and You, 2016; Zhou, 2016; Han, 2019). Wanghong economy is estimated to be worth of 58 billion yuan for 2016 alone and is considered the next economic growth pole for Chinese internet (CNB data, 2016). This paper historicizes and deconstructs wanghong value chain of advertising and online retail underpinned by the expanding infrastructural and market power of dominant Chinese platform companies through economic and data synergies with one another and with wanghong incubators since 2015. Sketching key corporate synergies between eight high-profile and influential platforms and internet companies from two sectors, e-commerce and social media including Alibaba, JD, Weibo, ByteDance, Kuaishou, Bilibili, and WeChat, this paper argues that dominant platform companies in China have played profound roles in constructing a flexible, transplatform ecosystem facilitated by wanghong and wanghong incubators, and these platforms have tailored the wanghong value chains to fit for their own business goals through corporate synergies. Analysis also shows that the two biggest Chinese platform companies, Alibaba and Tencent, endeavors to further operationalize power over other platforms through the construction of this synergistic, connective ecosystem of wanghong economy.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This paper treats digital labor as a matter of scientific management, and questions how workers’ subjectivity forms and functions in the labor process. Taking dualistic model of passion as the research lens, we examine its antecedents and work-related outcomes in the context of Chinese online literature industry. Using a sample of 531 platform-contracted writers (PCWs), we find that: 1) Harmonious passion representing the automatic way of work internalization is facilitated by perceived hedonic value, career ambition and emotional supportive feedback, and contributes to productivity; 2) Obsessive passion referring to the controlled process of work internalization is driven by perceived hedonic value and career ambition, and contributes to continuous commitment. This study provides evidence on the perceptions, motivations and behavioral intentions of the creative workers in precarious and overwork settings and highlights the role of dualistic passion in implementing empowerment and exploitation.\n","Abstract Body: The study of workers in the Creative and Cultural Industries (CCI) often combines macro-level accounts of political economy with small-scale studies, often qualitative, of work in specific organisations, occupations, and/or sectors. While rich in both the theory and qualitative detail of creative labour, and especially useful for the study of precarious and informal work, such studies cannot capture population movements within cultural employment over time, nor the factors associated with continuing employment. The Australian Census Longitudinal Dataset (ACLD) provides a unique opportunity to track a national sample of workers in a broad range of cultural occupations across three waves of the Australian census, from 2006 to 2016. This provides an opportunity to consider the factors associated with both selection into, and then continuity within, cultural production employment. The study of factors associated with primary employment in cultural productions is significant, as such positions are a relatively privileged resource within a broader field characterised by temporary and informal work arrangements, including casual, contract and unpaid work. The question of who holds these jobs is a question of social distribution. We examine the key factors such as gender, age, qualifications, and household dynamics, to compare the relative importance in determining the employment and continuity of work in the field of cultural production.\n","Abstract Body: The practices of news media are becoming increasingly embedded with digital social media platforms and the constant changes in their technological affordances and infrastructures. Building on institutional theory this paper seeks to trace the effects of the platform infrastructure from inside a media organization by focusing on the strategic internal organizing and related internal discussions in connection to social media. The empirical material was collected from a Nordic news media organization during a 6-month period of both on-site and virtual ethnography, complemented with interviews and chat log data. The findings based on this diverse and in-depth inside view show how the organizational forms and practices are adapting to the pressures of the platforms, manifesting the infrastructuralization and institutionalization of the digital platforms in the media industry. Finally, our findings imply that the forms of platform isomorphism are intertwined with the discourse of journalistic values.\n","Abstract Body: <br />The power of global platforms has increasingly become the subject of public and scholarly scrutiny (van Dijck et al. 2018, Evan and Donders 2018). Research has shown how global platforms radically change dynamics within the media industry and how national media organizations struggle to cope in what has gradually become an uneven playing ground (Ganter and Nielsen 2017). A central dilemma for national players has been to make use of the opportunities given, while protecting revenues, trust and control. This paper explore tensions between national media players and global platforms in a Norwegian context, and more specifically how these tensions open up for industry and policy action. Three key research questions guides the paper: How do key industry players frame the main tensions between national media organizations and global media platforms? What kind of opportunities and solutions do key industry players present to these tensions? How do key industry players act to influence policy-making processes? Theoretically, the study combines insights from platform studies (van Dijck et al. 2018, Gillespie 2018) with the Media Policy Field (MPF) approach (Steen-Johnsen et al. 2019). Methodologically, we applied a mixed method approach consisting of document analysis of policy documents, public hearings and industry reports, and 13 interviews with CEO/top-level industry decision makers. A key finding in the paper is that global players creates fundamental tensions within the national media industry, which national players frame both collectively and exclusively, depending on their interests, resources and mandate. In the paper, we discuss how frames are constructed at three levels: global versus national players, private versus public players, and small versus large players, and how these frames are connected to calls for industry and policy action. Although these conflict lines resonates well with previous studies, our study highlights the constant re-defining work of national media players as they keep shifting positions to create and utilize policy windows.\n","Abstract Body: Findings across media markets indicate decreasing circulations and vanishing advertising revenues. At the same time, local media remain crucial for the functioning of democracies. Therefore, media professionals and policy decision-makers are looking for solutions to reinvent local media in the digital age. Against this background, this study conducts a quasi-experiment in a Swiss local media market to investigate whether and under what conditions specific public support programs will actually facilitate the digital transformation of local media. More specifically, this study draws on strategic path dependence theory as well as longitudinal qualitative and quantitative data in order to investigate the effects of public support programs on the innovation of digital content and business strategies of local news organizations, which differ in terms of media type, structures, resources and performance (N = 47). This study contributes to media industry studies by empirically testing the potential of public support programs for local media innovation.\n","Abstract Body: As a proto-industry, the YouTube field is growing and changing rapidly, and scholars have yet to examine the space that major online video companies like BuzzFeed Video hold in the field. Through an analysis of former BuzzFeed Video employees’ discussions of why they left the company, as well as the videos they produced before and after their departure, I explore the realities and creative myths surrounding the field of online video. Results indicate that while creators who work for major corporations cannot blatantly participate in practices typically associated with the industry, such as performing authenticity, participating in self-branding, and building a community of fans, they seek out small ways to practice those tactics within their productions. Furthermore, their motivations for pursuing independence, as well as the content they produce once they do so, reflects the dominant mythologies of online creative work while also signaling changes in our understanding of how the YouTube industry operates.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Subscription crowdfunding platforms, such as Patreon and Twitch, market themselves as spaces where digital creative workers can secure stable income from a loyal group of patrons, and where patrons can reap exclusive rewards and strengthen their relationship with beloved creators. Drawing on Zelizer's concept of relational work, this study examines how digital creative workers simultaneously connect <i>and<\/i> transact with their patrons on such platforms. A content analysis of forty Patreon campaigns revealed that digital artists employ parasocial relational work to obscure the economic nature of crowdfunding. Artists frame monetary subscriptions as social support between two intimate parties and compensate their patrons with socially intimate rewards, such as self-disclosure and real-time interaction. In sum, digital artists encourage their patrons to support them as friends would by promising to treat their patrons as friends in return, a finding in line with current trends in creative labor and audience studies.\n","Abstract Body: The concept of in/visibility, which has long provided analytical purchase in sociologies of work and labor, has recently emerged as an organizing principle in critical examinations of digital media workers—those who labor <i>behind-the-screens<\/i>. Against this backdrop, this study uses the ideal of visibility to probe the contours and valuation of an emergent field located at the interface of technology and creative industry: social media employment. Drawing upon 42 in-depth interviews with social media workers, we propose a framework for evaluating various categories of digitally mediated labor. The framework is organized along four interconnected dimensions: 1). <i>economic in/visibility; 2). social in/visibility<\/i>; 3). <i>political in/visibilit<\/i>y; and 4). <i>technological in/visibility. <\/i>We conclude by bringing our findings into dialogue with concerns about the politics of visibility in both the media and technology industries.\n",null,"Abstract Body: As audiences continue to consume television in different ways across the globe, audience measurement and television ratings services have had to innovate to stay relevant. Through a comparative case study, this paper draws on management literature on innovation to consider two such services—Nielsen in the United States and the Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board (BARB) in the United Kingdom—and their new measurement innovations since the beginning of the twenty-first century. In particular, the differences in Nielsen’s and the BARB’s histories make them approach innovation differently; acquisitions and market pressures often drive Nielsen’s innovation as a for-profit company, whereas internal drive to serve the industry propels the BARB’s innovation as a not-for-profit limited company. Nevertheless, both companies have made moves towards total audience measurement, demonstrating the necessity of such innovations to maintain a position of dominance, despite operating in different media markets.\n","Abstract Body: This paper reports the findings from an international comparative study of screen agencies and film funds across a number of small EU nations. Using interviews with senior staff in these bodies along with analysis of policy materials, this research offers insight to the evolving rationales, roles and models for publicly funded interventions in the film and television sector. The research also advances the field of cultural production by examining the professional identities and challenges for those working within these agencies.<br /><br />Despite considerable disruption to the screen sector, publicly funded subsidies and financial supports continue to be essential to the provision of film and television. There is an elaborate global system of fiscal incentives and direct funding espoused under rationales of economic growth and cultural protection (Leiser 2017; Ramsey et al 2019). National and regional screen agencies are one of the main elements in this system, yet there has been little critical comparative research on their activities or how they are evolving in response to changes in the sector. In the context of small nations, screen agencies assume significant responsibility due to specific structural issues within their market including limited domestic markets, less license fee income for PSBs and smaller labour markets.<br /><br />This research highlights how screen agencies and film funds play a key role in the assembly and allocation of disparate financial, logistical and talent resources, often in temporary ways in response to industry demands. Our research emphasises that in doing this, many agencies have shifted from being exclusively funding bodies to being more rounded development agencies supporting both domestic production and attracting inward investment. This can be viewed within the wider shift from cultural to economic objectives in screen policy (Mingant and Tirtaine 2018; Hammett-Jamart et al 2018) and the growing power of mobile transnational content producers and distributors like HBO, Netflix and Amazon Prime (McElroy and Noonan 2019).<br /><br />Many agencies (though not all) are now tasked with promoting the screen sector as part of an economic agenda in which to increase and build the sustainability of indigenous production. More and more of their role involves investment decisions, labour market interventions, nation branding and capital investment. Furthermore, the research points to a number of emerging agendas for screen agencies including: expansion of expertise and funding to support new forms of screen technology (e.g. apps, VR, gaming), attempts to establish more diversive production cultures, and efforts to reconfigure a new map of screen production through regional redistribution of funding and resources.<br /><br />Emerging from this research is a critical understanding of the making of creative content and the ways in which cultural policy is shaped and enacted in response to regional, national and global markets by screen agencies and film funds<br /><br />This paper also reflects of the value of comparative research to the media industries research agenda. Our methodological approach necessitated multinational, multi-sited and multi-method research (including policy research and interviews). Our work routinely travels into and between several small nations including: Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Ireland, Denmark, Belgium and Croatia. Challenges for this approach emerge including developing robust and analogous quantitative data and the considerable commitment needed for international fieldwork and cross-border dialogue. However, the value of comparative research is clear to us as a way providing a more nuanced understanding of the multi-layered geographies of cultural production and as a route to attending to urgent questions of power at a time of content abundance and industry disruption.<br /><br /><br />Keywords:<br />Film, television, screen agencies, policy, small nations<br /><br />References:<br />Hammett-Jamart, Julia; Mitric, Petar and Novrup Redvall, Eva (2018) <i>European Film and Television Co-Production<\/i>: <i>Policy and Practice.<\/i> Cham: Palgrave Macmillan<br /><br />Leiser, Stephanie (2017) The Diffusions of State Film Incentives: A mix method case study. <i>Economic Development Quarterly<\/i> 31(3): 255-267<br />McElroy, Ruth and Caitriona Noonan. <i>Producing Television Drama: Local production in a global era.<\/i> Palgrave Pivot: Hampshire (2019).<br />Mingant, Nolwenn and Tirtaine, Cecilia (eds) (2018) <i>Reconceptualising Film Policies.<\/i> Routledge: New York.<br /><br />Ramsey, Phil; Baker, Stephen and Porter, Robert (2019) Screen production on the ‘biggest set in the world’: Northern Ireland Screen and the case of Game of Thrones. <i>Media, Culture and Society<\/i>. https://doi.org/10.1177/0163443719831597<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Given the state sponsorship of film production in Germany, this paper critically examines general mechanisms in the formation of meaning in German filmmaking. With reference to Schimank’s recursive framework of agent-structure dynamics, the results of 103 expert interviews with screenwriters, directors, producers, distributors, festival curators, cinema theater operators, funding representatives, and public television editors, as well as document analyses, the paper shows that the medium’s construction of reality is anything but unconditioned. On the contrary, owing to the essential role of film funding and public television in the agent constellations intertwined with social structures that shape the film production process in Germany, the medium’s key communicators are confronted with expectations that far exceed economic parameters. More precisely, the paper reveals that German filmmaking reflects a political dimension and expresses hierarchies and constraints that prompt struggles for legitimate meaning and question any autonomous practice in the field.\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines the factors predicting the frequency and duration of local broadcast television blackouts by Multichannel Video Programming Distributors (MVPDs), as a consequence of breakdowns in retransmission consent negotiations. Using a database of 372 retransmission agreements executed between 2011-2018, the paper uses a binomial logistic regression to identify the factors predicting blackouts, and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression for the duration. It finds the broadcasters’ network affiliations, the number of cable subscribers affected by a retransmission agreement, and a time trend to be the most significant predictors.\n","Abstracts: Prior to issues involving disagreement over Korea’s installation of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) system in July 2016, remakes of Korean films were seen as a popular approach for official Chinese-Korean co-productions, as they were perceived as being a less risky investment. This perception was mainly based on these films’ proven success in the Korean box office, online discussions by international (particularly East Asian) audiences, and the availability of casting Chinese <i>idol<\/i> singers based in Korea. To further explore these assumptions, this paper seeks to delve deeper by exploring the reception of these remakes to understand the rationale behind using specific casting and story-telling strategies, as Chinese socialists’ ideologies remain dominant in these cultural productions. In taking this approach, the paper seeks to assess the importance of localization, along with canvassing a range of opinions regarding the ‘Korean’ and ‘Chinese’ styles of storytelling.<br /><br />Kai Ruo Soh (Kai) is a PhD candidate at the University of Wollongong.

Along with increased Korea-China co-productions, K-beauty’s presence has grown bigger in the Chinese media industry, and many Korean make-up artists have been recruited in China. As the aesthetics and practices of K-beauty infiltrate into the Chinese media, K-beauty serves as a cultural site where values and identities are contested. Since K-beauty is mainly recognized by its market achievement, it is important to discuss its cultural meaning in a trans-Asian media context. The current study addresses this question through an analysis of in-depth interviews with Korean beauty specialists who have worked in Chinese media production, and media coverage on K-beauty in China. Examining how K-beauty is interpreted, practiced, and negotiated in Chinese media production, this study aims to locate K-beauty in trans-Asian beauty production and discusses its cultural implications.<br /><br />Sojeong Park is a PhD Candidate in the Department of Communication at Seoul National University. Her research interests include diverse media culture and visual culture with a focus on trans-Asian media practice and identity formation. Her research has been published in The Journal of Popular Culture, Korea Journal, and a variety of Korean refereed Journals. In her current research, she examines on the matter of whiteness in Korean beauty discourse, exploring how K-beauty is interpreted, practiced and negotiated in Asian context.\n","Abstracts: Due to the Chinese Communist Party’s ban on Korean entertainment content, Korean pop music agencies have recognized the urgency and importance of diversifying overseas markets. This study is an attempt to situate the increasing association of Korean pop stars with the American and European music markets in a regional context. Notably, the Korean pop music industry has developed export-driven structures and production systems during the past few decades, expanding the Korean Wave phenomenon throughout East Asia. China was one of the two major importers that sustained the Korean pop industry’s focus on the regional market. However, the unpredictability of Chinese political tensions and diplomatic negotiations have pressured Korean pop agencies to seek out alternative partnerships beyond this region. Based on an industrial analysis of Chinese-Korean connections in pop music production and consumption, this paper explores how regional integration has generated alternative interactions among physically disjointed music industries.<br /><br />Ju Oak Kim is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology and Communication at Texas A&M International University.

Popular discourse on Malegaon has presented it in an elaborate juxtaposition of the tedious labor at the textile mills, trancelike space of the local make-shift theatre, and the visual sprawl of everyday life to paint the picture of subaltern cinephilia. Malegaon film has become a fetish object and as an industrial oddity constructed purely in its relation to established formal media industries. But what is the place of industries like Malegaon in the larger discourse on the complex media industrial network in India and global media industries at large? In this paper, I seek to address this question by placing Malegaon film among a network of “informal” video industries in India and examine the term informality and remake to map a complex multi-tiered industrial network of media industries.\n","Abstract Body: This project focusses on the dynamics tying Anglo-American media systems, players and institutions to the history of Japanese animation's importation to and through Latin America. In order to do so, it proposes three models through which anime's importation to Latin America can be understood, expanding on Daya Thussu's models of media and cultural flow. These models, each corresponding to a different era of anime’s importation to Latin American media markets, outline the way in which anime has developed as a globally-trafficked commodity, as well as its role in Latin American popular culture.Both of these interrelated histories were fundamentally altered in the early 1990s with the sudden emergence of anime into the Anglo-American mainstream, an event that would place US-based intermediaries at the center of anime’s global distribution in Latin America from then on.<br />This paper then seeks to contextualize both the pre-history and history of US involvement in Latin America’s experience of anime textualities, with an eye towards establishing how this trajectory corresponds both with wider dynamics of neoliberalization, and the current and corresponding integration of Latin media cultures and textualities within Anglo-American media platforms, infrastructures and institutions. By using anime’s Latin American circulation as an entry point to such dynamics, this project likewise seeks to track under-examined modes of transperipheral media flow, and show in what way these more generally function amid the wider hegemonic structures of global cultural circulation.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the dynamics of coproduction between a global subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) platform and a local producer. Based on a case study of ‘YG Future Strategy Office’ co-produced by YG Entertainment and Netflix, it examines how various expectations of both companies are embedded in this series. On one hand, YG considers co-production as a means of promoting its artists for the global market which otherwise cannot be produced through pre-existing broadcasters. On the other hand, Netflix expects such coproduction to target the Asian market so that it can respond to the entry of incumbent media moguls into the SVOD market. While such co-productions seem to benefit both global platforms and local producers on the surface, however, this relationship may result in deteriorating the position of local actors as potential subcontractors considering the importance of distribution in the mediascape.\n",null,"Abstract Body: International streaming services such as Netflix are aggressively expanding into new regional markets changing local television ecosystems. This paper explores Netflix’s recent expansion into South Korea, the biggest television exporter in East Asia. I intend to investigate how Netflix’s market entry into Korea is reconfiguring conventional production processes and production studio’s business model. My research question asks: <i>How is Netflix’s direct investment into production houses changing the conventional business model for Korean production companies?<\/i> This paper will especially focus on Netflix’s recent acquisition of ‘originals’ from the conglomerated production house, Studio Dragon, and analyze the new formulaic business model that stabilized the corporate structure of production houses. I aggregated cost and profit data of four Korean tv series to compare and contrast conventional independent production studio’s business model versus Studio Dragon’s sales model after partnering with Netflix. Netflix’s aggressive investment allowed local production studios to grow more independent from legacy channels, stabilize the revenue model, and to produce bigger budget shows.\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines foreign IDTV services in Australia from four interrelated perspectives using a media industries, including a production studies, framework and addressing central issues in theories of media imperialism and media globalisation. It uses interviews and critical industry discourse analysis.<br /> <br />Impact on the consumption environment<br /> <br />Netflix has had a remarkably rapid take-up in Australia, reaching nearly 11.5 million Australians in less than five years (Roy Morgan, 2019), overtaking the monopoly cable/pay-TV Foxtel provider very rapidly. So rapid that a usually very sober media analyst such as Graeme Turner has called it a ‘game changer’ (2018). It attests to the power of the Netflix brand and to a range of consumer or demand-side factors, including high-quality user experience (Spangler, 2019); a relatively consistent price point (Masige, 2019); the entrenchment of the service into our lexicon (Rickett, 2015) and popular conceptions of viewing (‘Netflix and chill’); and an overarching emphasis on exclusive original programming and content acquisitions (Netflix, 2019) that are often branded as the advancement of screen content (e.g. <i>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch, The Irishmen<\/i>), created for a ‘lost generation’ of viewers (Brownlow as cited by Cunningham, 2018/19).<br /> <br />This remarkable demand-side phenomenon has added to the financial and viewership woes of particularly the commercial broadcasters, which have been assailed on the advertising side by Google and Facebook and on the ‘attention economy’ side by Netflix and other streaming services (Stan, Amazon Prime Video, and others). So much so that Tim Worner, head of leading network Seven, quixotically tried to tie a crisis in entertainment for the commercial broadcasters to the crisis for journalism, appealing to the competition regulator to include entertainment in its remit in the recent (2018-19) ACCC Digital Platforms Inquiry. It has also raised the stakes for the local production industry, given the historic regulatory quid pro quo which has guaranteed a minimum level of commitment to local scripted drama, documentary and kids content – the core content formats in which streaming services specialise.<br /> <br />Impact on the regulatory environment<br /> <br />The production industry depends on a stable regulatory environment. So-called ‘market failure’ genres have been the key targets of regulation. It is very important to note that there appears to be a natural fit between IDTV key genre and the core ‘market failure’ genres that most television broadcasting content regulation is directed at: quality scripted drama, comedy, kids, documentary. The main IDTV services specialise in these genres. (see Alpha Beta 2016 for a break out of the preferred formats across SVOD, AVOD, linear broadcasting and pay/cable.) This makes the <i>cultural<\/i> rationale for regulating IDTV services much stronger. It also makes it more urgent, because of the realpolitik of regulation. The substitution effect of the increased consumption of these genres on IDTV services means that, if there is no move to incorporate IDTV services into the regulatory framework, the disparity between domestic incumbents’ regulatory burden and international IDTV services will grow, and will strengthen the pressure brought to bear on the policy system and government by broadcasters and pay-TV for <i>deregulation<\/i>.<br /> <br />The production industry and associated advocacy bodies have generated substantial policy argument recently across several enquiries (Australian and Children’s Screen Content Review (2017); ACCC Digital Platforms Inquiry (2018); Senate Inquiry into Australian Content on Broadcast, Radio and Streaming Services (2018)) with the main emphasis on bringing IDTV services under a regulatory obligation to meet local content requirements. The shape of those requirements has not been strategically refined in this set of debates. We would argue that it is crucial that a version of an expenditure/revenue model (Keslassy, 2019) be developed, rather than a catalogue quota model (European Parliament, 2018), as this would focus any potential regulation (and the effect of any threatened regulation) on the need to support original content, rather than merely add to the trickle of residuals for acquisition of back catalogue. There is a distinct precedent – in Australia – for an expenditure requirement to be placed on foreign suppliers of drama content (ACMA, 2014/15). The evidence for the success of the expenditure quota on predominantly drama channels in the Australian pay-TV ecology is strong and there is an extended historical record to be examined here (McCutcheon, 2006).<br /> <br />Having differentiated our preferred stance from that which has been most fully developed in Europe thus far, we would however align with the European focus on discoverability. Even as IDTV services claim that promoting local content on their services cuts against the personalised, algorithmically-generated recommendation systems that drive their customer interfaces, it is clear that Netflix and Amazon Prime Video promote their own Originals, so specific promotion per se is absolutely programmable. It is also important to argue that discoverability in the IDTV space is the equivalent of exhibition regulations in the broadcasting space, and secures the cultural, rather than the industrial, rationale (that Australian consumers have every chance to consume Australian content) for regulation.<br /> <br />While there is little evidence to suggest that the current Australian government will move to regulate IDTV services, what has happened has been the extension of the Producer and Location Offsets to IDTV services (Fifield, 2019). This is a potentially substantial ‘carrot’ that could precede at least a threatened regulatory ‘stick’.<br /> <br />Impact on the production/services environment<br /> <br />It is important to stress the cultural innovation and industry stimulus that disruptive forces such as Netflix have visited on the Australian production environment. International SVODs have provided another distribution and funding source; have picked up and revived series dumped by broadcasters; have strengthened/reinvented genres (e.g. anime, horror, sci-fi, teen); addressed underserved demographics, particularly Millennials; contributed to more cosmopolitan popular culture consumption; and provided a global platform for niche interests. IDTV services have grown the production funding pie. In Australia, whereas overall 2017-18 was the lowest turnover in six years, with declines or static growth in the key market failure genre, the only big increase – off a low base – was Online Drama, which is now for the first time spending more than kids TV (Screen Australia, 2018). A further classic instance of disruptive innovation has seen the pay-TV sector sufficiently challenged to have seen the monopoly service, Foxtel, forced to unbundle and rebrand as a multiplatform service (McDonnell, 2019) to compete with the new IDTV players, with consumer betterment.<br /> <br />But perhaps, by volume, the most significant stimulus the imminent arrival of Netflix has caused has been the pre-emptive establishment of Stan by Fairfax/Nine (now Nine) (Ward, 2015). Stan has consistently branded itself around its Australian identity and content offering (Duke, 2018). This is bolstered by the fact that while Australian content in the Netflix AU catalogue sits at approximately 2%, local titles make up 9% of the library of Stan, its main domestic competitor (Lobato and Scarlata, 2019).<br /> <br />The cultural intermediation of impact<br /> <br />Perhaps the most intriguing of all of the impacts of international streaming services on the Australian screen ecology is that it has caused it to need to deal with a new type of internationalisation. Ted Sarandos, Netflix Chief Content Officer, has articulated their approach as ‘We’re not trying to make more Hollywood content for the world. Rather, a big part of the strategy is to bring content from different countries to a worldwide audience’ (as cited by Spangler, 2018). While this suggests a very different, post-cultural imperialism paradigm, it is not borne out in an analysis of established Netflix catalogues in representative countries. But it is borne out in their Originals commissioning strategy.<br /> <br />This is intriguingly clear in the cultural frames being used by reviewers to make sense of the corpuses of Australian originals being produced by Netflix and Stan. Our argument is that cultural criticism and reviewing of these corpuses is seeing the resumption of the old – yet remarkably resilient and perhaps foundational – opposition between ‘discourses of nationalism’ or Industry 1 and ‘discourses of internationalism’ or Industry 2 (Dermody and Jacka, 1987) in an attempt to deal with Netflix Originals content that no longer fits. Whereas Stan’s Australian originals (including <i>No Activity<\/i>, <i>Wolf Creek<\/i>, <i>Romper Stomper<\/i>, <i>The Other Guy<\/i>, <i>Bloom<\/i> and <i>The Second<\/i>) are reviewed as untroubling extensions of well-understood local genres and representations, Netflix’s <i>Pine Gap<\/i>, <i>Tidelands<\/i> and <i>Lunatics<\/i> have been met with excoriation or bemusement.<br /> <br />The reasons for this are worth speculating about, as they have implications ultimately for both the maximisation of opportunities for the production industry out of the presence of international streamers in the Australian screen ecology and for wider community support for regulation.<br /> <br />It can’t simply be that Stan has commissioned better quality product. The producers of Netflix’s originals (e.g. Screentime and Hoodlum) are experienced and indeed industry leaders. And it can’t only be attributed to Netflix’s global, and Stan’s local, audience, as Stan’s originals have been aggressively and quite successfully sold into multiple international markets.<br /> <br />In part it must be because Netflix’s internationalism is unlike the internationalism of the old binaries as identified by Dermody and Jacka (1987). It is content produced to fill new verticals or genres such as millennial supernaturalism (<i>Tidelands<\/i>) – which Netflix may not have invented, but have done much to popularise globally – or very edgy comedy (<i>Lunatics<\/i>). There are plenty of Netflix originals that look at international political and conspiracy dramas into which <i>Pine Gap<\/i> fits neatly. Netflix internationalism can be, but in these instances is not, about so-called ‘runaway’ production – pretending that the locations are somewhere else. Nor does it look like international coproduction, where typically the storylines are designed to take characters from country to country to appeal to audiences in specific locales and satisfy multiple national funding agencies. Netflix internationalism is not concerned with downplaying Australianness; indeed, it can double down on it when it suits the marketability of the content (e.g. Hannah Gadsby’s <i>Nanette<\/i>, Chris Lilley’s <i>Lunatics<\/i>). This can give rise to the point that Netflix offers significant international exposure opportunities for content and performers whose material would be unlikely to appear on more regulated platforms such as broadcast television.<br /> <br />References<br /> <br />ACMA (2014/15) ‘2014-15 New eligible drama expenditure scheme results’, <i>Industry ACMA<\/i>, https://www.acma.gov.au/Industry/Broadcast/Television/Australian-content/new-eligible-drama-expenditure-scheme-results-i-acma-1<br /> <br />AlphaBeta (2016), Bigger Picture: The new age of screen content, https://www.alphabeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Google_Bigger-Picture-Report_Dec2016.pdf<br /> <br />Cunningham, S.

The Australian production sector nonetheless remains part of an increasingly tumultuous and integrated national and global media market, characterised by audience fragmentation, local market contraction, foreign ownership, disruptive technologies and new streaming players. This paper will systemically unpack strategies the Australian production sector has employed to create “local” stories for audiences of all ages that successfully negotiate these shifting international market conditions. It will pay particular attention to the types of “local” stories considered most effective at transcending the conflicting demands of the contemporary television marketplace, as well as to the ownership structures of production companies that negotiate these market conditions successfully. Its conclusions will inform broader debates about the emerging conventions and norms that characterise small nation television production in the on-demand age.<br /><br />Kevin Sanson is associate professor at Queensland University of Technology.

The purpose of this research is to examine the ways in which modern American cultural journalists understand their cultural authority and strategize to maintain and expand that authority in the face of a variety of financial and technological challenges and external industry actors. The author examines this issue through in-depth interviews with 40 American cultural journalists and a textual analysis of a selection of their work published in 2019.\n","Abstract Body: Smartphones are ubiquitous accompanying their owners throughout their day. Among the pragmatic utility of the device, this study refers to the potential of the phone to also gratify psychological needs. Following idea of smartphones to constitute ‘digital companions’ the study analyzes the effect of taking away the phones from their owners to further elaborate the psychological impact of smartphones. In an experimental study, smartphone owners were separated from their phones (n = 31) for a six-day period. Compared to a control group (n = 28) which kept their phones, results revealed that smartphone separation results in more positive and less negative affect. However, users with higher self-esteem reported more negative affect when separated from their smartphone. Further, for more compulsive users, the separation from their phones was significantly associated with lower negative affect. Compared to the control group, participants who had to give away their phones reported higher levels of well-being. They also reported significantly decreasing levels of both the fear of missing out and nomophobia. In sum, the findings support the methodological approach to separate users from their smartphones. Furthermore, they support the theoretical conceptualization of this device to constitute a digital companion rather than mere technical equipment.\n","Abstract Body: The widespread diffusion of smartphones has increased the risk of developing a dysfunctional attachment to the device, yet a maladaptive pattern of use also depends on a set of psychological, social, and behavioral vulnerabilities. An excessive amount of time spent on the smartphone is considered a risk factor in developing and reinforcing smartphone addiction. Moreover, higher levels of trust in others may lead to more frequent online interactions behaviours. Hence, the willingness to connect and the tendency to seek immediate excitement, influenced by a set of individual dispositions including social anxiety and dispositional trust, potentially leads to increased online involvement, smartphone use and smartphone addiction. In this study, we used data collected in spring 2019 from a sample of 160 young adults (M age =  23.38, SD = 3.99, 50% male) to determine the relationship between social anxiety and smartphone addiction, mediated by smartphone use. Furthermore, we aimed to test whether the relationships between social anxiety, smartphone use and addiction were moderated by the degree of dispositional trust in others. The results showed that social anxiety was significantly and positively related to smartphone addiction, however, smartphone use did not mediate the relationship between social anxiety and addiction. Dispositional trust moderated the relationships between increased levels of use and smartphone addiction, with higher levels of trust predicting higher levels of smartphone addiction. Moreover, dispositional trust also moderated  the relationship between social anxiety and smartphone addition, strengthening the effect of high levels of social anxiety on smartphone addiction. Our results underlined that highly anxious individuals might develop a dysfunctional attachment to the device, allowing them to avoid potentially stressful interpersonal face-to-face interactions. Similarly, heavy smartphone users, with the tendency of trusting in others, may show higher levels of smartphone addiction because of their constant seeking for connections. Higher levels of trust may lead to a misperception of security and safety in online environments, by encouraging and promoting online interaction seeking and reinforcing a vicious cycle that leads to smartphone addiction. Drawing from our results, future research should investigate better high levels of trust as a risk factor in the online environment, especially for socially anxious individuals and heavy-users.\n","Abstract Body: This study unraveled under what circumstances, and via which processes, smartphone access restriction causes anxiety. Participants were randomly assigned to one out of three types of restricted access. Findings indicated that smartphone restriction resulted in more anxiety, which can be explained by nomophobia. Mobile internet restriction resulted in more anxiety which can be explained by FoMO. Interestingly, heavy social media users felt relief in feelings of FoMO and anxiety when mobile internet was inaccessible.\n","Abstract Body: Mobile messaging offers users many advantages, but has also been associated with lowered emotional well-being, specifically, feelings of guilt. To explain guilt about <i>too much<\/i> messenger use, self-control research points to conflicts with primary goals and tasks. Conversely, research on the social norm to be available suggests that <i>too little<\/i> messenger use may also trigger guilt reactions. The current research integrates these perspectives and adds a self-determination theory lens. Our work has two aims. First, we investigate how guilty individuals feel about using versus not using messengers. Second, by considering both boundary conditions of guilt about messenger usage simultaneously, namely goal conflicts and availability norm salience, we test whether the dilemma resulting from both conditions (high goal conflict <i>and<\/i> high availability norm salience) interacts in evoking guilt. Hypotheses were tested with two preregistered studies, a vignette experiment (Study 1) and a laboratory experiment (Study 2). Results from Study 1, but not from Study 2, support the hypotheses that goal conflicts trigger guilt about using messengers and that guilt about not using messengers arises if the availability norm is salient. In both studies, using messengers elicited more guilt than not using messengers. Moreover, our findings did not indicate that the two boundary conditions interacted in influencing guilt. The research overall points to the importance of inter- and intrapersonal norms when studying effects of mobile use on emotional well-being.\n","Abstract Body: #Thinspiration is often associated with pro-ana social media networking sites and refers to content advocating extreme weight loss by the means of images or text on social media. Since the platform for these social media sites is often a mobile device, it is important to understand the messaging surroundings its use. This study aims to identify some of the characteristics of social media posts using the hashtag “#Thinspiration” by answering questions related to the trends of its use over time, the other hashtags used in association with it, and the type of imagery that is posted when the hashtag is used. Of secondary interest is emotional nature associated with the posts using the #thinspiration hastag. A content analysis of 1024 posts gathered across Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr using Crimson Hexagon™ software was conducted, and the analysis identified several characteristics of #Thinspirational posts. Approximately 75% of content originated on Twitter, while 13% were blog posts on Tumblr, and the remaining 11% were photos on Instagram. Joy was the most commonly conveyed emotion associated with #Thinspiration posts at 74%; other emotions measured were sadness, anger, fear, disgust and surprise. A total of 44% of all #Thinspiration received basic positive support, whereas only 6% received basic negative support. Most of the comments associated with the #Thinspiration hastag were related to aspiration and/or inspiration, suggesting the posts were used as a source of motivation for viewers’ own health behaviors. These and other findings are discussed.<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: mHealth apps are growing in popularity among smartphone user. Such apps often contain social features that enable users to compare their behavior with others but in order to function, mHealth apps require users to share health information, which is regarded as especially sensitive private information. This poses a threat to individuum’s privacy. Building on social comparison theory and privacy calculus, we investigate the effect of users’ social comparison orientation and privacy attitudes as well as the mediating effect of health information disclosure on user’s intention to use a mHealth app. Relying on a PLS-based structural-equation model in a sample of N = 528 participants, our study supports claims of a positive effect of social comparison orientation on intention to use a mHealt app. Further, the negative effect of privacy attitude and the positive mediation of information disclosure were supported as well. The study also demonstrated that findings were stable when the context of information disclosure is changed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Despite the ubiquity of smartphone ownership and the increasing integration of social engagement features in smoking cessation apps to engage users, the social and non-social engagement features that are present in current smoking cessation apps and the effectiveness of these features in engaging users remain understudied. To fill the gap in the literature, a content analysis of free and paid smoking cessation mobile apps was conducted to examine a) the presence of social features (i.e., social support, social announcement, social referencing) and non-social engagement features (e.g., personal environmental changes, goal setting, progress tracking, reinforcement tracking, self-monitoring, personalized recommendations), and b) their relationships with user engagement scores measured by the Mobile App Rating Scale. The findings not only contribute to the mHealth literature by applying and extending the theory-based mobile health apps engagement typology, but also inform future architecture design of smoking cessation mobile apps.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Children are increasingly using their smartphones for communicative and non-communicative purposes. Smartphone use might influence children’s levels of loneliness, but their loneliness might also influence how they engage with the smartphone. Parents play an important role in regulating children’s smartphone use. Thus, we tested the moderating role of active and restrictive mediation on the relations between different types of smartphone use and loneliness. We conducted a two-wave panel survey among 10- to 14-year-old children and their parents resulting in total of 384 parent-child pairs at Time 2. Our results revealed that non-communicative use at Time 1 increased loneliness at Time 2. We also found a reciprocal influence, i.e., loneliness at Time 1 increased children’s non-communicative use at Time 2. We found no moderating influence of active and restrictive parental mediation on the relations between children’s smartphone use and loneliness. Our findings are discussed against the background of the poor-get-poorer effect regarding smartphone use.\n","Abstract Body: Short-formed mobile videos are gaining increasing popularity on social media apps. According to previous research, social media content has demonstrated promise in promoting new technology adoption, especially in the company of humor and appropriate camera view. <i>TikTok<\/i>, as a recent social media of quirky, short-formed videos on mobile devices, may become a powerful tool to disseminate entertaining content that persuades users to adopt new technologies. In this study, 81 participants watched a random subset of 20 videos about Smart Home from <i>TikTok<\/i>. Participants reported video viewing experience concerning five psychological responses through a questionnaire: Immersion, Physical Presence, Social Presence, Perceptual Realism, and Entertainment. ANCOVA and PROCESS were performed to test mediator models between video characteristics (i.e., humor use and camera view) and post-viewing intent to adopt Smart Home technologies, through possible mediators as psychological responses. Results showed that the first-person view elevated not only Presence but also Immersion, Perceptual realism, and Entertainment. Social Presence was found to be the primary affordance of a short-formed video app like <i>TikTok<\/i>. By increasing the feeling of social presence, short-formed mobile videos may improve user interaction with mobile social media and increase users’ adoption intent of the technologies depicted in the videos.\n","Abstract Body: With over one billion daily active users WeChat is the most used messaging app in China and around the world. Yet, studies on the well-being implications of WeChat use for close tie communication among the general Chinese population is lacking. Based on a representative online survey of smartphone users in China (N = 908), this study shows that while face-to-face and mobile voice communications were directly related to well-being, the positive influence of WeChat use and mobile email were not direct, but rather indirect through perceived social support and friendship satisfaction. The findings are framed through the lens of communication technology modality and the Internet-enhanced self-disclosure hypothesis and demonstrate the importance of comparing different uses of the smartphone to create a clearer picture of the psychological consequences of different forms of mobile communications.\n","Abstract Body: Given its role as a constant companion in contemporary societies, the mobile phone has long been regarded as an extension of the self. However, the psychology of smartphone self-extension has received relatively little attention through empirical research. By explicating previously theorized dimensions of smartphone self-extension, here we explore the dimensionality of smartphone self-extension as well as potential antecedents of these subcomponents. Results provided support for a two-dimensional structure of smartphone self-extension. Specifically, we found that self-extension can be delineated on the extent to which the smartphone is viewed as (1) functional for personal goals and (2) important to personal identity. Habitual smartphone usage predicted the functionality dimension and problematic smartphone usage predicted the identity dimension. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for conceptualizing smartphone self-extension, along with the challenges of measuring the psychological connection that exists – or is perceived to exist – between user and phone.\n","Abstract Body: As the smartphone continues to gain prominence in society (Lee et al., 2015), and as interactions are increasingly connected to mobile technologies (Liao & Humphreys, 2015), challenges are added to studying interactions in the public spheres. While traditional social media challenges “the rhetorical situation” (Vatnøy, 2017), the mobile element of societies’ emerging spaces exaggerates such a challenge. Current digital social spaces are made up by complex multimodal utterances driven by constantly changing communication cultures, reached through mobile devices from anywhere. Hence, one needs to approach current digital spaces differently than one did in the time of discussion forums mainly driven by verbal text, made for desktop computers. This extended abstract is a first attempt to start tailoring an appropriate approach to studying this new rhetorical situation. The idea is that when combined with digital ethnography, in-depth interviewing in the non-digital might evade the most prominent challenges with concurrent ethnography in the traditional sense, when it comes to approaching mobile social media interactions.<br /> <br />Moreover, and following this suggestion, is evaluating <i>text as behavior<\/i>. This would invite digital ethnography (Lindgren, 2017) as a kind of qualitative content analysis sensitive to the complex interaction space of multimodality that mobile social media is, and its efforts to compensate for the lack of phsysical (and immediate) communication. The latter especially concerns the kind of communications that cannot be transcribed to words in non-digital settings (such as body language and facial expressions). Hence, seing text as behavior acknowledges how technology continously provides and answers to a broader range of human offline communication forms. As we in a social <i>place<\/i> would not only assess what is said, but also how things are said (considering voice and body language for instance), one should approach the social <i>space<\/i> not only by looking at the verbal written word, but it’s relation to other modes, as they are relevant to the communication there. Ethnographically emphazising that language are not only oral words, but also behaviors, thus tailors methods to new interaction realities, more fit to capture the broad range of human behavior in communication.<br /> <br />But as digital spaces gains importance for interactions, one needs to be sensitive to <i>the way<\/i> in which humans act in this new situation in order to evaluate them. Regarding the «text» we see on social media as a kind of behavior will only capture parts of contemporary interactions and their role for individuals and society. The problems of studying only «text» when wanting to say something about social reality and effects is nothing new then (e.g. Livingstone, 1991; Stromer-Galley & Schiappa, 1998), but can be seen as reviving for methodological discussions as digital social media gain importance as spaces for interactions, and as observing behavior there, conversations and expressions, in its multimodal forms only captures what seems to be “the outcome” of the rhetorical situation. Hence, studying digital interactions requires that the researcher not just investigates content drawn from digital social spaces, but <i>experiences<\/i>, as the latter can inform interpretations and understandings of the former.<br /><br />This is especially due to the observation that while having «[...] an exclusive focus on behavior at the expense of meaning» (Lamont & Swidler, 2014, p. 157) might be limiting alone when wanting to understand the interactions, the new rhetorical situation can enhance the problem even further as one can interact in the digital without leaving traces. One can be present in a social <i>«virtual»<\/i> <i>space<\/i> on the digital «invisibly». In <i>physical places<\/i>, on the other hand, one is at least <i>seen as<\/i> present, even though one might not contribute verbally or through body langauge, being silent and disengaged. It is also this possibility of being «invisible», inherent to mobile communication, that makes traditional ethnography insufficient. A researcher being present in offline reality would partiuclarly disrupt the situation of digital interaction, compared to offline interaction, as the presence of others in the latter case at least resembles familiar situations (people being present in the situation where interaction is made). Observing people using their smartphones would influence the very way the conversations and interactions on social media come about and evolve. But as indicated, observing “from within” is not sufficient either. Being inside social media environments as an observer would not be sufficient to make claims about the interactions’ in a public sphere perspective, as one would risk only reaching communication <i>outcomes<\/i>. While this is also why interviews are fruitful in offline traditional ethnography, it might be a particular challenge when observing behaviors in the online setting. The interactions are experienced and created “between” the individual alone and the social media environment depicted through the smartphone. Hence, interactions come about in situations where individuals’ actions are not observed, and also – different from in interactions in “non-digital” reality – where other participants are not aware of their presence, until the individuals themselves decide to visibly take part. Hence, mobile social media not only enables an “invisible participation”, independent of time and place. These features are inherent to the communication happening there.<br /><br />Moving further than merely <i>observing<\/i> in digital spaces might thus help prevent only reaching communication outcomes. It might bring the researcher closer to interactions meanings and implications, and how interactions are created in a merge between offline and online reality, taking the new rhetorical situation of the smartphone as an in-between-element into account. Hence, digital ethnography is seen beneficial for assessing behavior on mobile social media, through looking at interactions and expressions there <i>as<\/i> behaviors. Such an approach nevertheless requires being followed by in-depth interviews, the idea is, as these methods must go together to grasp the meaning and nature of the emerging communication in public spheres.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This submission is an extend abstract for the escalator session.\n","Abstract Body: In the past decade, mobile communication has developed as a viable avenue for social interactions, influencing users’ social support receipt, and life satisfaction. However, little is known about users’ mobile communication competency skills, which are equally important to understand the mobile communication’s impact. In a sample of 504 participants (Mean age = 32.58 years; 42% female), this study examined a mediation model in which mobile communication influences mobile communication competence (MCC), while social support serves as a proximal outcome of MCC, and life satisfaction is the distal outcome. Findings revealed that mobile communication was significantly associated with effective and affective MCC. Whilst, effective, affective, and appropriate MCC could exert positive influence on life satisfaction via social support. Besides, a direct influence of affective MCC on life satisfaction was also uncovered. The authors discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.\n","Abstract Body: Dating app use is prevalent among non-single Chinese gay men. Applying domestication theory, this study explores how non-single Chinese gay men use dating apps, how gay couples negotiate the rules of dating app use and the boundaries of their relationships, and what symbolic meanings are associated with dating apps. It reveals that non-single gay users’ various motives and uses generally construct a dual role of dating apps: a pool of sexual/romantic alternatives and a channel to the gay community. Although the former constitutes a threat to monogamy, the latter leaves room for the negotiation between the couple for acceptable but restricted uses. This negotiation is in tandem with the negotiation of relational boundaries, as the domestication of dating apps can result in either the reinforcement of monogamy or the embrace of non-monogamy. Regarding the symbolic meanings of dating apps, Chinese gay men tend to dismiss dating apps as unremarkable as other social media platforms. Monogamous or not, they put faith in user agency and do not perceive dating apps as a real threat to romantic relationships.\n","Abstract Body: Smartphones are ubiquitous in American lives and can interfere with parent-child relationships.  This technoference, or the interruption of interpersonal time by technology, has been associated with negative parent-child interactions and can indirectly threaten child safety. Nonetheless, little is known concerning possible factors that may exacerbate parental technoference.  The current study explored new parents’ media usage and technoference attitudes as they relate to executive function, or the ability to control impulses and focus. Responses indicated that both mothers and fathers were more supportive of technoference attitudes in association with digital media use (i.e., text messaging and social media) and entertainment media use (i.e., apps, video games, TV). Regarding executive function, only for mothers was lower executive function associated with an increased acceptance of technoference attitudes, both directly and as mediated through more digital media use. These findings emphasize the importance of boosting executive functioning skills, particularly among new mothers.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Mobile devices are being increasingly used to consume digital content, especially social media content. Yet, we know little about the differences in attention users dedicate to mobile content and its consequences, especially at the granular level of specific components of a newsfeed post (e.g., logo, title, recommendations). Additionally, we do not know whether users process content and are affected by it differently depending on the device (mobile vs. desktop). This pre-registered experiment investigates whether students (<i>N<\/i>=121) dedicate different amounts of attention to and are affected differently by branded social media content when they are exposed to it on different devices. In addition, we investigate the role of consumer recommendations embedded in social media ads. We find general attentional differences across devices that can influence consumers’ ad recognition, attitude towards a brand and purchase intention.\n","Abstract Body: With the astonishing speed of smartphone and application [app] development, mobile app sponsorship is gaining popularity as a tactic of strategic brand communication and cause-related marketing (CSR), especially in the area of health. Supporting mobile apps fosters communities of customers centered on their brand and/or helps them manage different health issues. It also curates personal customer data and tailors advertising messages and marketing initiatives to reach targeted audiences. However, there is a lack of research explaining how corporate app sponsors are evaluated and what attributions users generate in interactive mobile environments when evaluating the sponsor and the app. Therefore, drawing on the assumptions of attribution theory, two online experimental studies (<i>N<sub>1 <\/sub><\/i>= 252, <i>N<sub>2 <\/sub><\/i>= 467) investigated how the sponsor visibility (or obtrusiveness) influence attitude toward the sponsor and credibility and download and usage intentions toward the mHealth app, and whether these effects are mediated by sponsor motive attributions (altruistic vs. self-serving motives). The results of the both samples indicated that sponsor visibility in the app interface significantly influenced sponsor attitudes and app evaluations. Also, these effects were mediated by participants’ attributions about sponsors’ real motives. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in relation to mobile marketing communication and mHealth app communication.\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines how mobile communication and mobile banking is used by women in rural western Kenya (Elgeyo Marakwet). This is a resource-constrained area that means that the women need to be careful about the flow of money through their households. In addition to having scarce resources, women face structural inequality. Among other things, polygyny (one husband and several wives) is legal. Based on interviews with 25 women in this area we examine how mobile technology and the development of mobile banking play into this context. We examine how technology plays out in the management of the household economy, and how it is used in extra-marital relationships. We also discuss how women manage their personal money using mobile communication and how the technology is used in the collective savings groups, known locally as <i>chama<\/i>. At a broader level, we study how the mobile phone becomes the locus of tensions within the household and we trace how the development of M-banking both supports the lives of the women but also how this can eventually undercut the social support that women get from the <i>chama<\/i>.<br />Keywords<br />Kenya, Chama, Women, Polygyny, mobile money, mobile communication, M-Pesa\n","Abstract Body: Rapidly evolving and ubiquitous digital communication technologies have played a crucial role in shaping the quality and textures of mobile intimacy in transnational family life. In this paper, we examine how transnational caregiving performed through mobile devices and online platforms engenders intimate caregiving from afar. Drawing upon data based on in-depth interviews, we investigate how elite Filipino migrants in the United States use mobile media and a diverse range of networked platforms to deliver and negotiate caregiving at a distance among their left-behind and aging parents in the Philippines. This study extends the care circulation approach in the context of transnational familial communication through mobile media. Significantly, by critically examining the role of mobile media in facilitating mediation of everyday and routinized carework, microcoordination of care, the management of tensions and conflicts, and the performance of care, we propose the term ‘mobile carework’ to articulate the intimate, personalised, mobile, and negotiated care practices of transnational family members that are often shaped by the fusion of socio-cultural and technological forces. In sum, this study provides critical insights on how familial intimacies and relations are sustained through the provision of digitalised and differential care routines.\n","Abstract Body: This research explores exposure patterns and perceptions of cellphone and smartphone use among Amish and ultra-Orthodox Jewish women, while examining symbolic meanings these non-users might attribute to these devices. Triangulation of participant observations, interviews, and a survey, serve to demonstrate that although these populations differ in their <i>cellphone<\/i> use (the Amish mostly don't use them and the Ultra-Orthodox only use those deemed to be ‘kosher’), they concur in their non-use of <i>smartphones<\/i>, deriving from their perception, shared among many religious communities, that smartphone content is impure. Implicit in statements made by these women is the notion that the medium itself is more dangerous than the message. The <i>Apparatgeist<\/i>, the relationship between the utility and meaning aspects of a device enable us to see multiple levels of ‘context collapses’. From referring to the blurring of boundaries between the public and private, to the liminal spaces between the device and its user.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study explores mobile technology use among the homeless population in the Los Angeles area known as Skid Row. It explores the patterns of use and the connectivity challenges, and how these challenges affect access to social services as well as opportunities for information seeking, skills building and social capital formation. To characterize the unreliable conditions under which this population uses mobile technologies, we introduce the concept of <i>access<\/i> <i>instability<\/i>, a term that captures not simply the obstacles to technology access imposed by poverty but more broadly those stemming from a combination of poverty, housing insecurity and discrimination. The study is primarily based on a survey among adults experiencing homelessness (or at risk of) conducted over a span of five months, which is complemented by findings from participatory research intervention carried out in collaboration with a grassroots advocacy organization. Among the key findings is that reliable access to electrical power represents a fundamental yet understudied barrier to mobile use among marginalized populations, including (but not limited to) those experiencing homelessness. Lacking a safe and reliable place to charge their devices, the unstably housed must activate coping strategies that limit digital engagement and constrain effective use. Access instability thus disrupts the expectation of constant reachability that underpins modern economic and social relations. Ultimately, this narrows pathways out of homelessness by limiting the ability to gain and sustain employment, to connect with healthcare providers and other vital resources, and to maintain networks of personal support.\n","Abstract Body: With digital communication increasingly shifting to mobile devices, communication research needs to explore ways to retrieve, process, and analyze digital trace data on people’s most personal devices. This study presents a new methodological approach of mobile data donations, where user mobile log data is used to collect smartphone usage data unobtrusively. The iOS Screen Time function is used as a test case for gathering log data with the help of screenshot technology. The study investigates the feasibility of the method, sample biases, and accuracy of smartphone usage self-reports on a general population sample of Dutch citizens (n=404). Importantly, it explores how mobile data donations can be used as an add-on or substitute for conventional media exposure measures. Results indicate (1) that users’ privacy concerns and technical skills are crucial factors for the willingness to donate mobile log data and (2) a strong underreporting of smartphone usage duration and frequency.\n","Abstract Body: Scholars are well-aware that the smartphone is much more than just a mobile telephone. A plethora of applications have been developed to run on smartphones, covering just about every aspect of human life. What is distinctive about the fact that these apps run on smartphones (as opposed to other kinds of devices) is that the smartphone makes them mobile (the apps travel with the user) and locative (the apps know the location of the user). As a result, smartphone applications that take full advantage of these characteristics have the ability to bring users together in real space and real time. The key to the success of such netware apps is their generation and retention of social graphs that connect their users both socially and physically. Netware apps like ride hailing that are built around mobility and location have the potential to dramatically restructure economic and social life by reconfiguring their users' experiences of the physical and temporal world. We use ride hailing as a case study to illustrate how the new social geographies generated by mobile netware apps interact with physical geography to generate a new sense of space that can only be mapped by the companies that own our social graphs.\n","Abstract Body: Mobile social media have become a widespread means to participate in everyday social and professional life. These platforms stimulate the disclosure and exchange of personal information which implies certain privacy risks. While past scholarship has extracted various predictors and consequences of online privacy concerns, there is to date no empirical investigation of its relationship with psychological stress. Using a longitudinal panel study, we examined the reciprocal relationship between privacy concerns and perceived stress. Results supported the hypothesis that privacy concerns at T1 are associated with higher perceived stress at T2. However, we found no evidence for the reverse association, i.e. stress at T1 was not related to privacy concerns at T2. The findings are discussed against the background of the Antecedents Privacy Concerns Outcome Modelas well as the Privacy Calculus Model.\n","Abstract Body: With the prosperity of the smartphone uses, there are tremendous mobile applications (apps) in the market. Among a body of literature from several disciplines concerning innovation diffusion, new product selling, and technology adoption, few examined this phenomenon through an overarching lens and theory. The present study systematically looks at the diffusion of mobile media in the mobile application market by integrating theories from communication, information system, and marketing. We predicted the installation of mobile applications in the Google Play Store by computational method (<i>N <\/i>= 8190). It was found that popularity, characteristics, needs, user evaluation, and selling price all determined installation, whereby popularity (i.e., number of users’ reviews) is the most important predictors. The findings are discussed in terms of theoretical implications for understanding the consumption of new products and for practical implications in mobile app design.\n","Abstract Body: Moving Forward or Stepping Back?<br />Understanding How WhatsApp Users Understand the Forwarded Tag<br /> <br />AN EXTENDED ABSTRACT<br /><br />WhatsApp, currently the leading messaging application in the world used by an estimated 1.6 billion users (Clement, 2019), rolled out in July 2018 the <i>forwarded tag<\/i>. If a WhatsApp user forwards a message that had been previously forwarded to her, the receiver will see an arrow accompanied by the word “forwarded” on top of the forwarded message (see Figure 1). The goal for users was simple: The forwarded tag “helps you determine if your friend or relative wrote the message they sent or if it originally came from someone else” (Funke, 2018, para. 3).<br />The social goal is more complex: Prior to rolling out this new feature, WhatsApp was beta-testing it in India, where WhatsApp is the “internet” for most users, relying on it not just for communication but also for information, and where several men have been killed by mobs who were responding to fake news spreading on WhatsApp. The fake news messages came in different versions, but all with the same premise: Child kidnappers are roaming the village, sending panicked villagers to hunt random men (Frayer, 2018).<br /><br />From sharing to forwarding<br /><br />The original idea for the forwarded tag is to alert users that they are receiving a message that the immediate sender might not have vetted and was just passing from someone else. This should ideally make receivers more suspicious and hopefully will trigger them to verify the forwarded message, or at the very least be sceptical about it. But do WhatsApp users understand the forward tag the same way as WhatsApp intended it to be?<br /><br />The concept of forwarding a message online is not new. Email forwarding, which refers to the transferring of information as “an exact duplicate of a message that remains in the mailbox” (Kibby, 2005, p. 772), is probably one of the first instances of the forward function. Email communication, like other online communication, lacks context-related cues, such as physical appearance, time, place, or position. The lack of context cues makes email communication seem detached or distanced from the recipient. Yet, even when users are not sure of the veracity of the contents, some of them tend to forward emails that have been forwarded to them, or what was then referred to as chain emails.<br /><br />However, unlike email forwarding where it is possible to see a chain of sender’s names in forwarded emails (unless deleted), there is no information about the source in WhatsApp’s forwarded contents. When WhatsApp compresses images or videos sent through its platform, it takes away the creator’s user name and device information (Arun, 2019), making it almost impossible to discover the original source of a WhatsApp’s forwarded message (Simon et al., 2016). Still, some of the factors that motivate people to forward emails seem to be at work as well when it comes to forwarding on WhatsApp.<br /><br />WhatsApp is also not the first social media platform to roll out a feature to cue users that a message had been previously shared. Facebook and Twitter, for example, track and show number of shares and retweets. In these spaces, however, the “share” cue is viewed positively—in most instances it is considered as a measure of popularity, triggering a bandwagon heuristic (Sundar, 2008). However, WhatsApp envisions the forwarded tag as a form of caution, to signal to users that the content is not originally created by the immediate sender and could be fake. And yet originality, in this context, can be interpreted in contrasting ways. While the forwarded tag on WhatsApp signals that the immediate sender did not originally create the message, the same tag also signals to the receiver that the immediate sender did not modify, change, or tamper with the original message, preserving the forwarded message in its original form.<br /><br />Understanding the forward tag<br /><br />It is therefore important to understand how WhatsApp users understand the forwarded tag. Technological affordances have intended and unintended uses: Instagram, for example, is removing the “number of likes” that have always accompanied posts on the platform in response to negative and unintended consequences arising from the pressure to get likes, such as unhealthy diets, risky behaviour, and even figuring in criminal behaviour or accidents (Fitzgerald, 2019). Indeed, social media users have long been accustomed to popularity cues, as attention and fame become key motivations on social media. Therefore, it is easy to interpret (or misinterpret) WhatsApp’s forwarded tag as a popularity cue, especially because WhatsApp subsequently rolled out in August 2019 a double-arrowed forwarded tag (see Figure 2). A forwarded message marked by two arrows (instead of one) means that the message had been forwarded at least more than five times (Dixit, 2019).<br /><br />A study of Twitter users found that retweets can significantly enhance the perceived credibility of messages (Morris et al., 2012). Number of shares on Facebook is also seen as an endorsement of that content by many users. But how do users understand the WhatsApp forwarded tag? This study seeks to answer this question through a series of interviews and focus group discussions. Sixteen WhatsApp users in Singapore were interviewed, while four focus group discussions with WhatsApp users are being conducted. WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app in Singapore, used by 86% of Singapore residents, based on a 2019 survey by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism (Tandoc, 2019).<br /><br />Initial findings point to a need to clarify the meaning and purpose of the forwarded tag. While some respondents understand the tag as a warning that the message they had received was not originally produced by the person who had sent it to them, consistent with WhatsApp’s original intention, some respondents see the tag as an indication that they were remembered, igniting a sense of belonging, that as receivers they are part of a network of users that have received the same message. How these different understandings of the forwarded tag will affect how WhatsApp users process and trust the messages they receive is an important question that this project also seeks to answer.<br /> <br />References<br /> <br />Arun, C.

In the ensuing years, it has grown into an everyday mode of payment for millions of Kenyans, reaching across geography and social class. M-Pesa has also institutionalized, with more sophisticated features and the ability to purchase an ever-widening set of goods and services, from micro-payments to mortgages. Within this larger context of expansion and normalization within Kenya’s financial system, group chats have emerged as an important but still-new and understudied type of usage. These have become especially popular among students and other groups of people who frequently have shared expenses and wish to divide them.<br /> <br />This study focuses on group accounts: when and how they are used, for what purposes, and with what benefits and drawbacks to members of these groups. It seeks to uncover social and economic norms that accompany group accounts in different contexts, and the extent and limits of these norms’ power of enforcement. It also seeks to understand the role of trust in user behavior within group accounts, and the types of outcomes that can and do develop in these contexts. Collective banking requires that parties maintain a certain degree of trust, and shared accounts – whether in traditional banks or on mobile phones – present opportunities for malfeasance by participants who use the accounts to their advantage. Thus this study looks at an old set of challenges (tensions among account holders in shared accounts) in a new and dynamic banking context.\n","Abstract Body: Digital platforms including social media and messaging apps, have become valuable resources to citizens, allowing immediate access to quality information and news. These platforms are used as communication channels within social networks, allowing individuals to maintain their existing social relationships by sharing information that are relevant to their everyday lives. ’Connection’ and ’sharing’ are now rearticulated as affordances of social media platforms (Bucher & Helmond, 2018), which are increasingly reshaping the way of seeking, accessing and disseminating information. The use of messaging apps to share news has grown, with half of global news consumers using messaging apps such as WhatsApp for news (Newman et al., 2018), indicating an increased preference for more private and less confrontational spaces for information sharing. Sharing information is often contextual and embedded in other social activities (Knobloch-Westerwick & Johnson, 2014; Valeriani & Vaccari, 2016). Various features of digital communication technologies have enabled users to share more easily and efficiently using different functional tools, such as attachment, editing tools (copy and paste), interaction tools (commenting, liking, posting, etc.) or group chats, while interacting with others on the platforms. These technological affordances allow users to be able to engage with digital tools in sharing information in different ways. Another dimension that come into play is the socio-cultural factor that influences the ways in which people react to news and information in the online space.<br />The aim of this study is to explore an emerging phenomenon of information sharing practices that take place on messaging apps focusing on young adults’ information sharing practices in everyday social contexts. We have conducted five focus group interviews with a total of 25 young adults aged 18 to 21 in Canberra, Australia. We focused on this age group, who are namely, the generation Z (Gen Z) as this age group is consistently found to have different behaviours towards news and information compared to their older counterparts (Fisher et al, 2019).  <br />The results revealed that the majority of the participants were using Facebook as their primary source of news. Participants found that news on social media were more relevant to them, were localised and often faster than what they found on other traditional news outlets, such as TV or newspapers. In addition, news on social media gets their attention while they are on it for other reasons. Even when they are not intending to look for news, they feel they are informed about what is happening in the world by reading news shared on social media. Many of the participants perceived the news on social media to be more diverse, as they can see different thoughts and perspectives on the news. Keeping up to date with a wide range of issues remains important for young people, and they feel more empowered to choose what they see on social media, unlike news from traditional news media sources that are not interactive nor relevant to them.<br />However, this broad use of news on social media was not translated into news trust. On the contrary, participants were cautious about news stories they found on social media. They were aware of sponsored stories appearing on news feeds and that they might be fake news. They also found news on social media to be biased, an aspect very different to its diversity. This mismatch confused young news consumers as there was often a gap between what they observed on social media and what really happened. Such experiences with news on social media seem to have increased young people’s awareness of fake news and misinformation. This is similar to the findings that Gen Z are the most likely to fact-check (Fisher et al, 2019). What we have found from our interviews is that participants were skeptical about news from a single source. They would search for other sources to check whether the stories were consistent. Interestingly, they tend to pick up fake news or biased stories by instinct despite the fact they were never trained in news literacy programs in schools.<br />Having grown up in a digital world and in a culture of online remixing and sharing, Gen Z are adapting to the digital environment in their own way, where falsehoods and facts are mixed, and it is hard to discern. While Gen Z do not purposefully seek out news but they are more likely to be exposed to news stories from a variety of sources, while engaging in other activities on social media. They have a sense of generalised skepticism and reserve judgement until they confirm the facts, which is predominantly observed among social news navigators (Fletcher & Nielsen, 2019).<br />While it is widely believed that the younger generations are less literate in reading the news and critically thinking about the world, what is more interesting to acknowledge is that they do, in fact, have their own way of evaluating the veracity of the information. It is also important to understand how such habitual consumption of social news is shaping the ways in which young people engage with news, and as a consequence how it impacts on the society as a whole. Habitulised fact-checking and generalised skepticism are their responses to the overabundance of information in the digital age. This study focused mainly on university students, who are highly educated and have access to a variety of media. The next phase of this study is to examine different social contexts, including less educated Gen Z, older generations and other sociocultural groups. This will provide a deeper understanding on information sharing practices, and its relationship to trust.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Drawing from the communication infrastructure theory, this present study attempts to investigate how the migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong are able to obtain social support through the connections to various storytelling agents (i.e., interpersonal network, community organizations, and media outlets) during the political protest. The preliminary analysis of focus group discussion data with Indonesian helpers in Hong Kong suggests the ability of mobile communication to mediate their connections between migrant helpers and their storytelling network. These connections offer them emotional, informational, and instrumental assistance to cope with a crisis happening in Hong Kong. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The Internet has been accelerating in many countries, including both developed and developing societies. While in Indonesia as a developing country, the reformation movement of 1997-1998 saw the first substantial formation of an information society around new media, and the Internet was a significant element (Hill & Sen, 2005; Lim, 2011; Nugroho et al., 2011). It is undeniable that the Internet plays an essential role in the daily life of a high number of Indonesian people. The survey by the Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association (APJII) and Polling Indonesia (2019) stated that penetration of the Internet in Indonesia is 64.8%. While Indonesia is the third-largest democratic country and fourth-largest population in the world, thus Indonesia is also becoming an emerging country in terms of Internet use. <br /> <br />Internet users must develop specific skills in order to become digitally literate while digital literacy is not only contextual awareness but also a series of digital production skills that include the capability for creating, thinking critically, and participating, as well as consuming the digital content (Flew, 2014). The Indonesian national strategy has been targeting a balanced knowledge information society in which digital literacy or skills plays a vital role for users to be able to harness digital-based resources effectively. However, digital use is not yet benefited by all Indonesian men and women as there is still a gender digital divide in Indonesia (Suwana & Lily, 2017; Open Data Labs, 2018; Canares, 2019). Previous research from McKinsey Global Institute on Gender and the Asia Pacific stated that digital technologies accelerate progress on gender equality in several areas like labor-force participation, financial inclusion, health and education, and political voice (Woetzel et al, 2018). Indonesian young people usually connect to the Internet, mainly through their mobile phones, especially to access social media and daily communication (Pangestu & Dewi, 2017). It is necessity to explore gender differences in digital media use in Indonesian youth as this can be useful to develop the digital media literacy programs and policies that support gender equality of Indonesian information society.<br /> <br />Based on a survey of students enrolled in a university in Jakarta, this study explored gender differences in social media use, digital skills, and experience of the benefits of studying through mobile phones. Further, how different use of social media use and levels of digital skills are related to the experience of efficiency in sharing content and ideas and seeking support with studying among university students. <br /> <br />A self-administered questionnaire method was used to collect data. Two trained graduate students recruited undergraduate students and then distributed and gathered the survey, answering questions if required. In the survey method, items like social media use related variables, including activities and time spent on social media, five types of digital literacy (device and content understanding, device and content creation), and digital ethics. Also, the experience of the Internet for study, including searching for information and resource for education, seeking help with studying and assignment, and communicating with peers for learning and homework. In total, 524 respondents were collected, of which 496 respondents finally used for data analysis after data checking. In addition to the survey study, this study also conducted in-depth interviews with eight university students (four males and four females) to explore to gain fruitful and depth knowledge of their Internet use and experience in daily activities and education, digital literacy, and digital ethics.<br /> <br />The high penetration of digital technologies (such as mobile phones and personal computers), and various engagement in online activities (such as social networking and entertainment), observed in this study clearly shows Indonesian young people to be digitally engaged, as has been found elsewhere. There is strong evidence of an increasing trend in Internet use among Indonesian young people, although this may partially be related to the sample taken in the context of young people using mobile communication. While overall social media use is pervasive among the respondents in this study, there were significant gender differences in time spent and engagement with social media. Female students (9 hours) stay longer on social media than male students (7 hours) and use the more significant number of social media (7) than male students (5). Furthermore, there was a gender difference in engaging with different activities on social media. Female students are more frequent users of social media in social communication and management. In contrast, male students are more frequent users of social media and entertainment, such as playing games and watching video. However, no gender difference in social media use for group activities, information and learning, which was the most popular activity on social media, was found.<br /> <br />In specially, the gender differences in digital platforms were also found from the interview as female students more frequently use mobile social media. The female students utilized social media (social messaging apps like WhatsApp and Line) for organizing group meetings to discuss their group assignments and for looking at the information on campus assignments or study learning as their peer groups frequently shared in their chatting groups. However, male students used social media (social messaging apps) for connecting with friends and family as well as they prefer to search for information about study learning on websites or YouTube. <br /> <br />In terms of digital literacy, overall comparable digital skills in understanding devices and content were observed between gender; however, female students performed significantly better than male students in practices used for editing images or photos and for uploading images or pictures online. Furthermore, female students are more than male students likely to experience efficiency in sharing content and ideas and seeking help/support with studying. Both female and male students also shared in the interviews that digital literacy is very important for their daily activities and learning. They acknowledged that merely having access is not anymore enough to guarantee the effective use of digital media among themselves. However, female students in the interviews concerned more about receiving and sharing misinformation by social media than male students. Therefore, the emerging digital media literacy which includes not only being able to access social and information resource but also being able to analyze, share, and create right and good information online.<br /> <br />An ordinary least-squares regression analysis was conducted to examine how different engagement with social media and different levels of digital skills are associated with the experience of the benefits from Internet use. The result showed gender emerged as a strong predictor for the increased experiences of the efficiency in sharing content and ideas and seeking help/support with studying. Also, how young people engage with social media was significantly associated with the experience of efficiency in sharing content and ideas and seeking help/support with studying. Frequent engagement with communicating and interesting with friends and information-seeking activities on social media has a positive impact on the increased experience of efficiency in sharing learning resources and finding support from peers in learning. Digital literacy also emerged as a critical factor for the positive experience of learning; having a higher understanding of the device technology and content creation skills were positively related to the efficiency of internet use for studying. <br /> <br />Research has suggested that social media is potentially useful tools for promoting effective academic practice (Kalpidou, Costin, & Morris 2011; Madge, Meek, Wellens, & Hooley 2009). It has been found that undergraduate students benefit from social media use in education-related interactions with peers, as it facilitates obtaining peer feedback and engagement with collaborative work while at university (Gray, Vitak, Easton, & Ellison, 2013). The findings in this study are in line with existing research and further emphasize the significance of the current generation of undergraduates’ social networks developed via mobile social media.<br /> <br />This study highlights the increasing experience of efficiency in academic practice using such social interaction tools among female students. Previous research on the imbalance of digital literacy between gender found different perspectives of the technology and gender that shape different ways of solving problems (Tella & Mutula, 2008). While technology is more attracting female students when it presents as provides a comfortable way to do something and they are more likely to focus on technology use, while male students are more interested in technology works (Silver, 2001). Also, women are more motivated and comfortable to learn digital technology by female mentors than male as they are more patient for interaction, so it creates a conducive learning environment (Suwana & Lily, 2017.) This study focuses on the understanding of girls' perspectives of technology in education-related interactions on social media. Mobile social media and female mentors are essential sources of learning support for girls. <br /> <br />With the proliferation of mobile communication, learning to socialize and maintain interaction and social relationships online is becoming a vital part of young people's lives. Digital technology does not merely facilitate online learning but also play a crucial role in resource sharing by connecting those who need a resource to those who have the support in mutually cooperative ways, which ultimately enable users to accumulate their resources. The findings of this study demonstrate that those female students have more benefit from social media use by engaging with education-related interactions with peers. As a result, it is increasing collaborative works while at university. It is worth mentioning that the way to understand the value of technology in education and mobile social media, needs to move beyond seeing it as a learning tool. Also, there is a need to recognize digital technology value as a medium that enables learners to seek and share both tangible and intangible resources, such as materials, information, and social and emotional support. Lastly, the multi-stakeholders (academic, government, policymakers, non-governmental organizations) must implement gender mainstreaming into their digital literacy program and policy so it can maintain digital gender equality in the information society.<br /><br /><br />Reference<br /><br />APJII & Polling Indonesia.

Mobile phones, in particular, have grown to be quite popular in urban areas in North Korea (Kim, 2014, 2018). Though the North Korean government has forbidden Internet access via mobile phones, mobile telephony has made a huge impact on the daily lives of North Koreans. In general, speaking globally, mobile networks play an increasingly important role in facilitating social movements like the Arab Spring in the Middle East. This leads us to ask particular questions about the situation in North Korea: How do mobile phones play into the social norms of North Koreans? How do mobile phones influence the everyday lives of those citizens interwoven with the burgeoning market economy in North Korea? Finally, to what extent does mobile phone use have the potential to foment political action?<br /><br />The recent proliferation of cell phones makes North Korea an attractive site for discussions taking place in the field of media studies with regard to mobile telephony and its attendant empowerment and newfound freedoms. Current research on mobile telephony in North Korea has primarily focused on state policy and control (Noland, 2009; Cha & Anderson, 2011; Seliger & Schmidt, 2014). The literature seldom attends to the individual perspective—North Korean users in their everyday lives. Thus, this study brings together empirical cases in the current literature of mobile communications by analyzing North Korean individuals’ experience with mobile telephony. Investigating the multifaceted aspects, this study leads us to a better understanding of the ensuing changes in lifestyles and social networks interwoven with the current economic transformations in North Korea. I first explore the general market transition in North Korea and then examine the use of mobile phones in the country.<br /><br />Marketization and Social Spaces in North Korea<br /><br />In the 1990s, North Korea suffered a dramatic economic crisis after the collapse of the Communist bloc, as well as heavy floods and a severe drought. During the so-called “arduous march,” public distribution systems broke down and “black markets” expanded. North Korean life was dramatically changed. The expansion of the black markets included burgeoning service sectors and informal financial exchanges (Kim & Yang, 2015). With marketization supported by cross-border traders and smugglers, a substantial number of North Koreans were able to access outside media, brought into the country from China. Exposure was not limited to foreign TV and radio but also included USB drives, MP players, and DVDs containing foreign—mostly South Korean—dramas and movies (Kim, 2014).<br /><br />These social changes allowed room for illegal activities, such as watching films from capitalist countries and doing small businesses through social ties; meanwhile, the socialist economic system was ruined. Initially, the North Korean regime opened its own domestic cell phone service in late 2002, but, in 2004, it was banned following a massive explosion at Rongchon Station that allegedly targeted a train carrying Kim Jong-il, triggered by a remote-controlled wireless handset (BBC News, 2004). In December 2008, after a four-year ban on cell phone use, North Korea resumed its public mobile phone service. Since then, the mobile communication network has rapidly expanded its number of subscribers. This is partly related with Kim Jong-un regime’s agenda—building “socialist, civilized power,” which entails high standard of living and cultural conditions and environment (<i>Rodong Sinmun<\/i>April 19, 2012; Sep. 4, 2013; Kim Jong-Un, 2016). Thus, in North Korea acquiring a cell phone is legal, however, buying capitalist-produced contents through informal paths is illegal. Although the foreign culture is restricted in North Korea, mobile technology has led to rapid penetration into domestic routine.<br /><br />Mobile Telecommunication and Social Spaces<br /><br />To Lefebvre’s (1991, 2002) notion of social space, the processes of production are “political,” being formed by everyday interactions, practicing the space, and its appropriation and release to next users for temporary use. While space belongs to all, it also, in a way, belongs to each individual. As Ito and Okabe (2005) have discussed, mobile phones create “new kinds of techno-social practices that merge technical standards and social norms” (p. 260). Indeed, the use of mobile phones allows for new private/social spaces for everyday practices and social norms.<br /><br />The existing literature that is focused on the interplay between mobile phone use and private/social spaces tends to highlight how mobile technology can enforce and extend the private sphere (de Gournay, 2002; Fortunati, 2002). Such mobile telephony in private/social spaces, in turn, make democratic processes and political activism possible (Paragas, 2003; Rheingold, 2002). In the present study, however, I suggest that such perspectives overlook the limited effects of mobile telephony—specifically, when mobile telephony spreads into a social context in which the government has the power to surveil interpersonal communication channels. In so doing, I enrich the empirical studies of mobile telephony by adding socialist state examples to the discussion.<br /><br />Overall, this investigation examines the topic of possible private spaces and social discourses in North Korea via mobile phone use. In this research, I draw upon in-depth interviews I conducted with 11 North Koreans living in South Korea, with a focus on their mobile phone use. Six of my interviewees owned North Korean mobile phones. The remaining five did not own mobile phones while in North Korea but have experience contacting North Korean family members from outside the country, from either China or South Korea. The age of the interviewees is between 19 and 73 years. The years of their departures from North Korea range from 1998 to 2017: one left in 1998, one left in 2009, and nine left in the 2010s. As mentioned earlier, after having been banned for a number of years, domestic North Korean cell phone service resumed in late 2008. Thus, 10 of the interviewees experienced the rise of mobile communications in the country. The respondents were asked about how they used their mobile phones in their day-to-day lives, both at work and at home, while they lived in North Korea. Additionally, for the individual who left North Korea in 1998, she was asked about her experience contacting family in the North from outside the country. Most of the interviewees were from the middle class in North Korea, and eight were involved in the market economy through side businesses. All personal names are pseudonyms.<br /><br />Mobile Communication and Everyday Practices in North Korea<br /><br />Initially, in 2009, because mobile services were provided only to a few individuals, mobile phones were highly sought after fashion accessory to show the material level. As one respondent explained,<br /><br />Because not everyone owned [a] cell phone, it was not that useful back then; I remember it was around 2010. So, the initial role of a cell phone was just for showing off. When watching a South Korean drama or an American movie, their using a cell phone looked very fancy.… [E]specially among men in Pyongsong, it was a kind of trend to take a picture, posing with their new cell phone in front of [their] car. (Interview with Chong-ki, 55-year-old manager)<br /><br />In the last decade, many more citizens in urban North Korea—those who have gradually improved their standards of living with the spread of markets—have been able to buy cell phones from domestic vendors. Still, the majority of the interviewees responded that mobile phones continue to demonstrate the users’ socio-economic status and class. Further, cell phones have become a way to showcase the owner’s individual personality; this is especially the case among the youth, who decorate their cell phones with a variety of accessories (interview with Joo-hee, 19-year-old student). They use their cell phones to stay in touch with family and friends. For example, when a young man joins the army, his parents will often buy him a cell phone for him to keep in touch with him. Additionally, young people keep in more frequent contact with their lovers via their mobile phones (interviews with Young-ki, 42-year-old teacher; Hyun-jin, 27-year-old student; and Jung-woo, 28-year-old student). However, when they need to discuss an important issue, they prefer face-to-face interaction. All interviewees who had cell phones in North Korea told me that users would never talk about anything politically sensitive on their cell phones, believing that every single call was under government surveillance.<br /><br />For the younger respondents, using a cell phone provides not only a means of accessing intimate or family relationships but also leisure activities, such as watching movies or playing games. Some of the younger interviewees complained that most of the state-run applications are boring; thus, they chose to buy SD cards on the black market, illegally copied from China, containing films and dramas from China, South Korea, and the United States. One 28-year old informant remembered, “I mainly watched comic or action movies and didn’t believe any of the love stories between South Korean <i>chaebols<\/i>(owners of companies) and poor girls.” Additionally, one 19-year-old interviewee told me that, while living in the North, she had imagined South Korea as a paradise, which cultivated her desire for the outside world. Several of the respondents also said they were often quite fearful of being checked for possessing illegal “capitalist media contents”; thus, they were cautious about being caught by the police. They shared their reviews of films and dramas only with a few trusted people, because the attention from neighbors was quite worrisome. Notably, mobile telephony encouraged leisure practices to shift from the public view of the street to the more private space of the house. However, a “sense of being watched”—both by the state and their neighbors—led them to remain in enjoying private pleasures, rather than to create more social spaces for discussion and possible political action.<br /><br />The respondents’ experiences suggest that mobile telephony in North Korea is not only associated with private entertainment and family contact but also used for clarification or instrumental purposes. That is, many people in urban North Korea conduct market business to supplement their principal salaries using their cell phones. Using their phones, they are able to obtain market-related information, such as prices and the availability of new goods from China, as well as to negotiate prices. When delivering ordered goods, as well as either lending or borrowing money, names, birth dates, and cell phone numbers are necessary for business (interviews with Jung-woo, Young-ki, and Yon-soo). In this process, mobile communication turns out to be a chain of clarification and verification, constructing a space for connectivity. The North Korean regime has largely turned a blind eye to this informal economy, as “socialist prosperity” is a national project. As one interviewee told me, although most informal business is based on socialist patronage links, too much corruption is punished, as the government needs to warn the growing new rich class (interview with Young-ki).<br /><br />Additionally, most of the interviewees who live in South Korea now as North Korean refugees have also reached out to and maintained relationships with those still in the North. They have also regularly sent remittances to their family members in North Korea. As one person explained,<br /><br />A broker in the border region called me [in South Korea] via an illegal Chinese mobile phone, and she gave me another Chinese number and hung up on me. Then I called the number the broker gave me, and our call started. The broker attached her [North Korean] domestic cell phone, which [had a recording of] my cousin’s voice. So, I could listen to my cousin’s request: “Send us some money.” This is how I sent money to my cousin and my father in the North. (Interview with Jung-woo)<br /><br />In these transnational links between South and North, mobile phone become a medium of communication which connects cross-border kinship ties.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Mobile telephony in North Korea became a critical site where legal cell phone device and illegal media contents in SD cards coexist and where local and international connections intersect. Although the acquisition of mobile phone is legal, but the use of it was ambiguously placed in-between legal and illegal as well as socialist and capitalist spaces. In communication through mobile phone, North Korean citizens combine the practices of socialism such as the sense of being surveilled and patronized system with non-socialist activities such as capitalist culture or increasing wealth rather than equalizing tendencies. Although many North Koreans conduct informal businesses and enjoy non-socialist contents, however, which is not an expression of resistance to state socialism or their great leader.<br /><br />References<br />Cha, V.

[1] Mountain Province is one of the recognized traditional domains of the <i>Igorot<\/i>, or people of the mountains. <i>Igorot<\/i> community members use the term <i>ili<\/i> to refer to their hometown/community. It carries with it a strong emotional reference to their culture, of sharing the same practices, values, and tradition.<br /> <br />Five years after the ethnographic research done in 2013-2014 that informs this paper, the author revisited the three remote indigenous communities in Mountain Province: Panabungen, Besao; Payag-eo, Suyo, Sagada; and Guina-ang, Bontoc. The indigenous villages largely relied on their own sustaining faculties and thrived off the grid with very little public utility and zero internet connectivity. Now in 2019, the Igorots are now savvier with mobile internet as they access social media, albeit largely limited to Facebook.<br /> <br />In early 2000 they started to get mobile phone access and completely leapfrogged the telephone by 2005. Text messaging and regular calls were the main uses of their mobiles at the time. Cheaply-manufactured smart phones started to penetrate the community only in 2012. There was very weak data connection and few spot signals in certain elevated areas but nobody paid attention because of the very high cost of data connectivity.<br /> <br />Interest to use data started in late 2013 when Globe Telecomm offered free Facebook access, largely to create a need amongst users. They were successful only minimally as many villages were slow to catch up. They discontinued the free service in April 25, 2014 way before the urge to connect to the data grid was there. <br /> <br />In March 2015, <i>Internet.org<\/i> launched free Facebook in the Philippines as part of making the Internet more accessible to developing countries. Both major service providers, Globe Telecomm and Smart Communications, provide basic connection to Facebook. The critique is that <i>Internet.org<\/i> application is merely a decoy to acquire customers. Regardless of the politics surrounding access, there was a notable increase in internet usage in the villages.<br /> <br />Guided theoretically by the culture-centered approach, an alternative lens built on the notion that understanding and negotiating meanings are embedded within cultural contexts and values (Dutta, 2008), the proposed paper will discuss the <i>ili’s<\/i> journey as they get more connected into the internet grid. It looks into the issues of access, the patterns of use, the implications on the communities’ culture and traditions. The paper will also interrogate how their indigeneity is playing out and unfolding in the digital platform.<br /> <br />In this age of relentless connectedness, very seldom do we witness how a community migrates to the digital platform. Of particular interest is how their traditions, relationships and values migrate digitally as they are complicated by issues of access, representation and identity. These communities who appropriated the mobile phones for their cultural practices are taking it onto the social media platform.<br /> <br />At the backdrop, it is important to acknowledge that most of the first time mobile internet users in the indigenous villages associate it interchangeably with Facebook. This spawn various issues surrounding digital citizenship including indiscriminate sharing and proliferation of fake news.<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />References<br /> <br /> <br />Donner, J. (2008a).

Due to the abundant resources brought about by the Internet, this population can live a life with more autonomy and independence (Nimrod, 2014), thus getting an opportunity to engage in various social activities. However, affected by the theory of Digital Divide, previous studies have long been focused on the difficulties old people confront in accessing to the Internet (e.g., Deng & Wang, 2015; Ding, 2009; He & Zhao, 2017; Zhao & Kuang, 2018), little attention has been paid to those who have already adopted the new technology for social engagement. In this respect, the theory of “Active Ageing”, which was proposed by the WHO in 2002, offers a new perspective. According to this theory, families, communities and the whole society could all benefit from the social engagement of older people. How the elderly engages in various social activities with the usage of smartphones remains to be explored scholarly.<br />In China, the “old migrators” refer to the elderly (over 60 years old) who have left their hometown to reunite with their children or take care of their grandchildren, yet had no registered residence in new cities. A report from the National Health Commission of China (2016) points out that, there are nearly 18 million old migrators in China, accounting for 7.2% of the migratory population. Compared with the old people who live in their hometowns, the old migrators are often under both physical and mental stresses–they have to take over most of the housework from their children as well as endure the loneliness results from their increasingly narrowing interpersonal networks (Liu, 2016)–which may affect their adaptation to the new environment negatively. However, a few studies have discovered that some old migrators are using smartphones to reconstruct their interpersonal networks, helping themselves cope with the problem of adaptation (Wang, 2019). This means that there are salient differences among the old migrators, part of this population is adapting to the new environment through digital engagement.<br />Most of the studies on the old migrators have assumed that there is a binary opposition between the mainstream society and the immigrants (e.g., Chen & Sun, 2012; Ren & Wu, 2006; Yang, 2010). Such theoretical viewpoint led to an emphasis on the interaction between the old migrators and the local communities they have moved into, the role of the families in affecting the former’s social adaptation was either considered as negative or even totally neglected (e.g., Liu, 2012; He, 2014; Yang & Zhang, 2015; Yao & Wang, 2010). As Liu (2016) correctly pointed out, the social adaptability of the migratory population in recent days barely relies on their connection to the mainstream society, instead, it depends on whether they are treated equally in a relatively fair environment as well as whether they own a network of social support, no matter it is from the locals or their old connections. Therefore, rather than focusing on the interaction between the old migrators and the local communities, this study pays more attention to how the old migrators communicate with their families and what effect this may have upon their adaptation to the new environment.<br />Specifically, this study focuses on the old migrators’ digital engagement within family context so as to go beyond the passivity of the digital divide theory as well as the binary opposition between the mainstream society and the migrators within the domain of migratory population research.<br /><br />Research questions<br />The distribution of family power is essentially a dynamic process. Nowadays in China, the usage of smartphones is changing the power structure within family. The younger generation normally owns less power in family context (Zhou, 2015), except for technology-related activities. Better grasp of digital technology helps them reoccupy the dominant position, posing challenges to the absolute authority of their parents (Zhou, 2012). Nevertheless, the power distribution doesn't end. The younger generation is often asked to feed their parents with knowledge and skills in how to use smartphones. When the latter eventually master the skills and apply the knowledge they have learned to their daily practice, a process of reversed empowerment appears.<br />As for the old migrators, they have to move from hometown to their adult children’s residence. The ownership of the residence provides the younger generation an opportunity to occupy the power center of the family (Hu & Huang, 2018), which may result in an especially asymmetric structure of family power. The general objective of this study is thus to explore in what degree smartphones contribute to the process of empowerment, namely the redistribution of power between the old migrators and their adult children.<br />As an emancipation process, empowerment refers to the disadvantaged are empowered to exercise their rights, obtain access to resources and participate actively in the process of decision-making (SDC, 2004). For those who take an instrumentalist view of empowerment, access to resource alone will lead to empowerment (Luttrell et al., 2009). To go beyond this simplistic view, Longwe (1991) developed a hierarchical model to identify different levels of empowerment—the welfare level, when basic needs are satisfied; the access level, when equal access to education is assured; the conscientization and awareness-raising level, when structural and institutional discrimination is addressed; the participation and mobilization level, when the equal participation in decision-making is guaranteed; and the control level, when individuals can make decisions and their competence is fully recognized. From Longwe’s point of view, the lower level of empowerment is a prerequisite for achieving higher ones. In other words, empowerment can only be achieved gradually and progressively.<br />Family power is a multidimensional concept containing decision making, influence, and authority (Sprey, 1972), among which decision making is the main indicator of family power dynamics (Mcdonald, 1980). A recent study suggests that smartphones are reducing the barriers of obtaining information for the old migrators technically and economically (Long, 2013). The specific objective of this study is thus to discover how old migrators obtain information via smartphones (lower level of empowerment), whether the information is helpful for them to participate in family decision-making (higher level of empowerment), and which factor may foster or restrain their digital engagement.<br />Based on the exploration of old migrators’ information acquisition and family decision participation, this study aims to disclose the effects of smartphone use, so as to offer some important insights into the old migrators’ agency of digital engagement and the role of the family for this population to regain control over their lives in a new environment. Four research questions to be discussed are as follows:<br />RQ1: What kind of information do the old migrators acquire via smartphones?<br />RQ2: How do they engage in the family’s daily decision-making with the information they acquired?<br />RQ3: What kind of response do they receive from their adult children?<br />RQ4: Under which condition will smartphone use contribute to the redistribution of power between the old migrators and their adult children?<br /><br />Methodology<br />To understand the old migrators’ unique experience of digital engagement, in-depth interview is employed in the study. As a qualitative research method, in-depth interview has advantages in gaining profound understanding of people’s lively experience and the way they make sense of those experience, thus it can help researchers jump out of the existing frameworks to observe and interpret the unique experiences of the subjects from a bottom-up perspective.<br />In-depth interviews are conducted with the old migrators from several communities of Xiamen. As one of China’s special economic zones, Xiamen has attracted many people coming for career development. By the end of September 2019, the number of migratory population in China has been up to 2.878 million, which makes it the only city in Fujian province with a migratory population that exceeds the registered population (Lin, 2019). Consequently, a large number of old migrators has come to Xiamen to reunite with their children or take care of their grandchildren. Besides, the chosen communities share a common characteristic in that they are all residential areas for the highly-educated migratory population, which results in a relatively high smartphone penetration level for the old migrators.<br />The outline of the interviewing is classified into four parts in light of the types of family decision, namely consumption-related decision-making, health-related decision-making, education-related decision-making and the rest types of decision-making. Each part includes four themes: (1.) acquisition of specific information, (2.) information sharing during the process of family decision making, (3.) effects of information sharing, (4) assessment of smartphone use.<br />The process of data collection consists of two phases: the first phase is designed for a deep understanding of the effects of old migrators’ smartphone use on family decision-making. A total of 13 old migrators were recruited during the first phase. The second phase aims to identify the factors that affect the potential of smartphone use in empowerment. Another 17 old migrators is recruited in this phase.<br />The analysis of interview data was carried out in three steps. First, the translated text is coded line by line, and sentence segments related to the research questions are defined to complete the initial coding. Then, focus on the frequent sentence segments, integrate the code, form new code, and complete the focus coding. Finally, find the connection between the new code, rearrange it to construct a coherent theoretical interpretation and complete the pattern discussion.<br /><br />Part of Our Findings<br />The interviews with old migrators indicate that smartphones provide an opportunity for this population to satisfy their basic information needs. At the meantime, the information they acquired via smartphones also enable them to participate in family decision-making to some degree. In most cases, the interviewees reported that they did make suggestions in terms of family affairs when they began to live with their adult children. A few of them have even made some decisions for the family in terms of consumption and health in the first place. However, this kind of attempt were given up quickly. Due to the negative feedback they often got from their adult children, the interviewees gradually lost enthusiasm and confidence needed for further participation in family affairs.<br />Based on the data we collected from the interviews with old migrators, smartphone use does not bring about a dramatic change to the existing family power structure within which the adult children always have the priority in making the final call. However, it does pose challenges to the asymmetric power relations between the old migrators and their adult children—at least our interviewees have begun to speak out their expectation for more participation in family affairs and put it into practice in a delicate way. Limited cases of successful digital engagement also emerged in this study, reconfirming the critical role of the family has in fostering the old migrators’ digital engagement.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />References<br />Chen, C.

Most importantly, Young people have not received much attention, despite being celebrated as the drivers of innovation. More specifically, little attention has been devoted to understanding the emerging and receding patterns of mobile devices and internet access among young people, particularly the social and psychological motivations for weaving such new technologies in daily lives. It’s against this background that this study seeks to explicate how young people as social actors, seize the available network opportunities in specific contexts.<br /><br />The specificities of the diverse African context, the creativity and the agency of its ordinary people-particularly young people- in how they refashion new technologies to meet their needs has been acknowledged globally. Mobile money transfer services<i>(M-Pesa) <\/i>and <i>Ushahidi platforms<\/i>(Both Kenyan Innovations) serve as clear examples. Ordinary people at the periphery of technological innovations creatively weave a wide range of available platforms to forge social relationships their diverse needs-including news and information needs. Social media and messaging applications are deeply imbricated within prevailing cultural norms and values; they do not operate outside the existing social orders, but rather are deeply embedded within the prevailing structures of power and relationships in specific contexts<br />This article is drawn from a larger study conducted at the Technical University of Kenya (Tu-K) and the University of Eldoret (UoE) Kenya from November 2017 to July 2018. Universities as spaces of studying embody the social and structural place where young people spend most of their time with comrades and university employees (Such as lecturers, administrators, among other staff). By focusing on Universities, this study challenges the development and transformative potential discourses in the global South. These studies have often associated new media with transforming the lives of the poor, vulnerable and hardly literate masses often found in rural areas and informal settlements. Given this, “foregrounding the processes of youthful news production and consumption creates a way for us to think about who we are as a community and as a public, and how we intend to go forward together”(Clark and Marchi, 2017:5)<br /><br />With this in mind, this study sought to specifically explore how young people understood the news and possibly draw a nexus between the rise of news technologies as well as social networking sites in understanding news. From the 400 respondents, systematic random sampling was conducted to arrive at a maximum of seven participants in each year of study(1<sup>st<\/sup>-4<sup>th<\/sup> year), making the total number of participants 56. This gave me a  total of eight focus groups. In addition, a further two (male and female) participants from each focus group were sampled to participate in online observation, a form of ethnographic data collection. appropriate’ Miller et al., (2016) argue that‘Participant observation is learning about what behavior is considered (31).  I sought permission from these participants to follow them on facebook and twitter, to enable me to monitor their posts and possibly draw insights on what such posts were useful in defining and redefining what news is from their own perspective.<br /> <br />Gadliardone (2015) contends that the increasing access of ICTs should be studied in “relations to the variety of actors, networks, and languages that do matter in a specific locality rather than the idealized conception of the state-society relations (1). Uses and Gratification adopted in this study aims as shedding light on the motivations <i>why<\/i> and through the relatively new concept of scalable sociality demonstrate <i>how<\/i> social media content materializes through and within the scales proposed by Miller et al., (2016).  For this reason, a total of 800 questionnaires were distributed randomly to 400 students in each institution. In the qualitative phase of this study, participants in eight focus group discussions were probed on the varied motivations of not just owning mobile devices, but using them mainly to access information. This section questions and the ‘blanket’ generalization of youth as drivers of innovation (Ndemo & Weiss, 2017; UNSECO, JANUARY, 2016) by evaluating and offering a nuanced understanding behind the figures that have often indicated high mobile and internet penetration rates.<br />Although ‘young people’ have attracted considerable attention in Africa ( see Abbink & Van Kessel, 2005; Baller, 2007; de Bruijn & Both, 2017; Honwana & De Boeck, 2005; Lesitaokana, 2017; Muhula, 2007; L. Mukhongo, 2014; L. L. Mukhongo, 2015; Ndlela & Mulwo, 2017; Tufte, 2017), the debate on who fits well into the category of young people remains unsettled. In addition, the over celebration of the socio-technical skills of young people(Livingstone, 2009), has obfuscated the daily realities on the nature and form of young people’s agency, particularly on news consumption. Nonetheless, there has been considerable optimism, particularly in African states where young people form over 70% of the population (Ndemo & Weiss, 2017) on their creative potential in seizing online opportunities. Mobile devices and social media are widely believed to intensify and amplify the creative potential and agency of young people in myriad ways. This blanket believe, inadvertently, eclipses any meaningful attempt(s) to disentangle the ambiguities surrounding the study of ‘young people’’ in Africa. Honwana & De Boeck, (2005) argue that, thus by going beyond the ‘rosy’ statistics (i.e. young people constitute 70%), this study focuses on young people in public universities in Kenya, foregrounding ‘young people’’ as a sub-cultural category and ‘social shifter’ as argued by Durham (2005).<br />In Kenya as elsewhere, these platforms have afforded alternative avenues for self-expression (Ligaga, 2012), thus expanding the public sphere. In addition, they partly facilitate ‘civic participation and enabled opportunities for more voices actors and possibilities’ (Omanga, 2019:175). Most importantly, the potential of new media to archive information in a diverse range of formats thus allowing for such information to be replicated, repurposed, recirculated over time and space, forms part of the crucial changes in communication. Put differently, the relatively affordable cost of mobile and internet access have availed new avenues for public and private communication and information flows. Yet at the same time, the presumed ubiquity, and inclusive architecture of digital platforms sits disconcertedly with the lived experiences of many people in the Global South (Ogola, 2019:124). Srinivasan et al. (2019), argue that Africa’s digital transformation should be understood ‘for what it is, not what it should or could be, or indeed what it is not.<br /><br />Barely a decade ago, blog spots were revered as useful tools for information sharing and useful deliberative spaces for public discourses, yet the more things change the more they remain unchanged. Brinkman, (2019) notes that <i>Kenyanpundint.Com<\/i>, a Blogspot was incredibly useful in producing and disseminating news during the 2007 post-poll violence. Brinkman(ibid) argues that blogs and news websites are not ‘monolithic, timeless wholes, but can be regarded as sites where people ‘meet’ to discuss matters and to write about their experiences and views in a dialogic way, profoundly altering the character of ‘new’(73). Brinkman(2019:76) chronicles the significant realization by young people in Kenya about the news values of blogs. Therefore, young people have been at the forefront in the adoption and adaptation of new technologies to meet their individual and collective information and news needs, yet we don’t know how this has been enhanced or constrained by the merging social media and messaging applications.<br /><br />Findings support the conclusion that the conventional understanding of media has profoundly been altered by the rapid innovations, particularly the high mobile devices penetration rates among young people (smartphones, tablets, phablets, smartwatches, and smart glasses among others). While this might sound obvious for a conclusion, it is the emerging motivations of mobile devices ownership as well as the creative ways of staying plugged in that makes these findings unique. It emerged that news intersects with a wide range of young people’s needs, and materializes through a variety platform (Private and public). However, this is not a walk in the park for young people. Due to the relatively high cost of the internet, it emerged that young people navigate these data complexities by creatively hacking Wi-Fi passwords. Perhaps this offers a nuanced understanding of the ‘rosy’ statistics that have often indicated a relatively high internet and mobile penetration in Kenya.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Research on digital wellbeing and on the effectiveness of digital wellbeing interventions is growing. To date, however, facts concerning the prevalence of digital wellbeing and the use of interventions are scarce, especially among European audiences. Drawing from the results of a cross-sectional survey among Belgian individuals (<i>N<\/i> = 1000), we explore: (1) the extent to which people experience digital wellbeing, (2) make use of various digital wellbeing practices, and (3) whether different user groups can be identified in terms of their digital wellbeing. Based on people’s experience of digital media as functional support and satisfaction with their own screen time (i.e., digital well-being), we identified five different clusters of digital media users: the pragmatic users, functional users, ambivalent users, burdened users and skeptical users. These subgroups suggest a complex pattern of interaction as they differed in several demographic characteristics, type of digital wellbeing interventions used, and digital media ownership. Collectively, this study gives a first insight into which digital wellbeing practices work well for which user group, as well their unique struggles with balancing digial media.\n","Abstract Body: The use of media beyond the spheres of home, work, and leisure was one of the first main research areas of mobile media. Some studies on the subject exist, but mostly without comparison to other situations. Therefore, this study analyses media use in moments “in between” and compares it with other situations, which is done using the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). Results show that the use in-between times compared to other moments is mainly characterized by escapism.\n","Abstract Body: Within the public discourse, as well as among some communication scholars, there is one dominant narrative concerning mobile devices: that they (will) replace certain offline experiences. This paper shows, through a triangulatin of methods, in an explorative study of memorial sites in Washington, D.C., that mobile devices – while <i>changing<\/i> offline experiences – in fact can encourage offline engagements through the potential of being able to share the experience online and thus creating a new incentive for the offline experience. In the present study, this is the case in the context of memorial sites who are ascribed a new meaning by visitors with mobile phones: they are no longer mainly read as signifiers of collective memory but much rather, as signifiers of tourism. This study therefore expands the field of mobile communication research by adding a study which observes both offline and online engagement with a cultural site and thereby creates a more holistic picture of mobile phone use in the physical world.\n","Abstract Body: Although much of previous works on mobile communication have focused on the transformation of the sense of place, this paper delves on the sense of time as a part of the social transformation ushered in by expanding digital network. Based on ethnographic data collected with Japanese young users, it describes how people would experience and practice time in the age of social networks and reveals how the co-presence of virtual sociality in every living condition would ramify and diversify the perceived sense of time. Castelles’s (2010) concept of <i>virtual time<\/i> will be revisited as a framework for considering the dissolution of conventional time regime tuned for the ubiquity of social networks and continuous connectivity.\n","Abstract Body: Recent years have seen a growth in research centered around subclinical levels of psychopathy, Machiavellianism and narcissism, or the Dark Triad, with a focus on using self-report questionnaires and laboratory studies to delineate individuals’ Dark Triad levels and behaviors. Less is known, however, about the everyday behavioral manifestations of the Dark Triad, especially with regard to lifestyle behaviors like physical activity, sociability, and digital media use behaviors. To address these gaps in the literature, we report the results of a two-week-long smartphone sensing study in a population of young adults at an American university. Participants completed a 12-item measure of the Dark Triad and participated in a smartphone-based self-tracking assignment. Using smartphone sensors and metadata logs, we measured the daily behavioral tendencies of young adults focusing on their physical activity behaviors (e.g., walking durations measured from the accelerometer), sociability behaviors (e.g., frequencies of incoming and outgoing calls extracted from metadata logs) and digital media use behaviors (e.g., frequencies and durations of phone unlocks extracted from metadata logs). To understand the relationship between everyday lifestyle behaviors and Dark Triad traits, we computed a series of correlations and regressions among the 10 sensed behavioral tendencies and the self-reported Dark Triad. Our findings show that movement-related variables (e.g., durations spent stationary, duration spent moving, and duration spent walking) as measured by the smartphone accelerometer, were significant predictors for Psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and Narcissism. Similarly, sociability, as assessed through the frequency of incoming and outgoing calls, was an especially strong predictor of Psychopathy and Machiavellianism. Our results suggest that while the Dark Triad traits are inter-related in some ways, important differences are also apparent in their everyday lifestyle behaviors.\n","Abstract Body: Extended abstract submission.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined the impact of influential factors on the person and situation level in instant messaging (IM) communication using the experience sampling method (ESM). We measured how characteristics on the person level (i.e., availability preferences and responsiveness norm), contextual factors (i.e., time, location, copresence of others, and stress load), and message-related attributes (i.e., sender, chat type, and number of messages received) impact users’ responsiveness and perceived stress in IM communication. In the present study, we empirically investigated a sample of 90 smartphone users who completed 820 ESM protocols regarding their use of the messenger service WhatsApp. Results of the multilevel analyses revealed that users’ responsiveness, as well as their perceived stress, in IM communication is affected by person- and situation-level factors, but the latter was found to have a much stronger impact. The effect of specific influential factors is discussed in detail.\n","Abstract Body: Mobile media support our autonomy by connecting us to persons, contents and services independent of time and place constraints. At the same time, however, mobile media challenge our autonomy as we face new struggles, decisions and pressure in relation to whether, when and where we connect and disconnect. The ambivalent relationship that we have with mobile media has recently been captured in a new concept that refers to the (lack) of balance that we may experience in relation to mobile connectivity: Digital wellbeing. The digital wellbeing concept can overcome the conceptual and methodological limitations associated with former approaches to problematic digital media use. I argue that to reach its full potential, however, a theory of digital wellbeing needs to account for the dynamic and complex nature of our relationship to mobile connectivity. To that end, we can conceptualize digital wellbeing as an experiential state of optimal balance between connectivity and disconnectivity that is contingent upon a constellation of person-, device- and context-specific factors that interact in the short-term, but may also produce longer-term outcomes when pathways leading to digital wellbeing repeat themselves over time. Digital wellbeing interventions such as digital detoxes and digital tools that limit connectivity, then, can be understood as disruptors of these pathways. For a theory of digital wellbeing to reach its full potential, however, we require computational and digital ethnographic empirical approaches that can account for momentary associations between media behavior, individual experiences and situational contexts.\n","Abstract Body: Mobile networked creativity is an emergent practice that arises from the ongoing relationships among people and people with technologies—or networked resources. In this paper, we propose a concept of creativity as emerging from serendipity and mobility, a process that often arises from “opening” platforms and technologies, in situations of economic survival. Drawing from innovation, appropriation, and diffusion studies, we focus on how unplanned, emergent, and open uses of mobile technologies reveal how creative practices emerge, particularly in the context of mobile phone use where people are also physically mobile—sometimes away from each other—and yet connected via the internet. This concept of creativity as a constant process of becoming is a “recursive organization” that can be seen in the mobile media practices of groups such as migrants or people living in disenfranchised communities who survive in make-shift locations such refugee camps or slums. Contrary to the affluent and capitalistic-embedded traditional ideas of creativity, mobile networked creativity is a practice that is most often found in situations of economic hardship, power imbalances, and immobilities.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Workplace communication has been increasingly shaped by technology.  Findings obtained from traditional research in a face-to-face setting are becoming inadequate to explain work dynamics in virtual teams. By studying 397 virtual team members, the current study aimed to shed light on the mediating role of digital utility anxiety (DUA) in the relationship between online communication apprehension (OCA) and virtual organizational dissent (VOD). In addition, the study also explored whether there were gender differences in these relationships. The path model analysis revealed a full mediation of DUA in the relationship between OCA and VOD.  Males had higher DUA and expressed more latent dissent than females. Further implications and limitations are discussed in the paper.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Abstract<br />Older workers are facing problems in the labor market due to dominant stereotypes about their skills: older workers are believed to possess high quality soft skills, but to lack hard skills. The present study contributes by examining what qualities are requested in job advertisements targeting older job seekers. This is done by using an automated content analysis. In addition, interviews with recruitment experts are conducted in order to provide explanation and interpretation. Findings reveal that the persistent mixed idea about older workers performing well on soft skills and poorer on hard skills is reflected in job advertisements, as these represent hard skills to a lesser extent, whereas the soft skill of customer orientation is frequently requested in job advertisements. The mixed beliefs about older workers’ skills are reflected in the perspective of recruiters too, although with a sense of optimism that the soft-skilled older worker fits well with employers’ need for a soft-skilled workforce.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Currently, millennials are transitioning from universities to workplaces. Previous research has looked at newcomers’ organizational identification and socialization as well as membership negotiation. With this paper, we will contribute to the discussion of newcomer’s entry by broadening the knowledge on how millennials specifically construct their membership in communication processes and how these processes occur temporally in workplace communication. This qualitative study aims to understand millennial newcomers’ experiences of membership negotiation in workplace communication. Instead of a one-time interview, participants were contacted 5-10 times during the 4-10 months after they entered their first workplace post-graduation. The data were analyzed with a constant comparative method. Several communication processes were identified: developing reciprocity, seeking and perceiving acceptance, and becoming an active member. After three months, newcomers had found their place in the workplace and experienced themselves as accepted members. This study broadened the understanding of communication processes in membership negotiation and its temporal development.\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates identification of academic librarians who hold a professional position in a library of an academic institution. Results from semi-structured interviews from a total of 21 academic librarians from an Ivy-league university and two state universities reveal that academic librarians identify primarily with the profession rather than with their organizations. In addition, our results support the contextual basis of identification and provide more detail indicating that the amount of disclosure of identification is contextual depending on with whom they are communicating. In addition, although the literature discusses the positive effect of perceived external prestige, particularly on members’ organizational identification, our study discovers the prestige also serves as a negative cue, and our interviewees from the Ivy-league university try to avoid early disclosure of their organizational identification. Further, our results reveal that academic librarians use both convergence and divergence strategies to deal with stereotypes of librarians when they identify with their profession. Other findings and implications are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Amongst technology entrepreneurs, pivoting is a well-known business term that has been garnering academic interest in recent years. Although it is a commonly referenced tactic, the existing literature on pivoting has primarily focused on the business rationales driving pivots, the decision-making processes leading up to the pivot, and the risks involved in pivoting for corporate stakeholders. While these studies have built our understanding of pivoting decisions, there has been less empirical work examining the specific ways that companies perform pivoting at the field level and as a cultural entrepreneurship strategy. Rather than following individual organizations, this study examines the pivot from a sociological and naturalistic perspective, looking at how pivots are performed by companies at field level industry conferences (FCE). By analyzing the augmented reality (AR) industry across several years of FCE (2012-2019), this study looks at how several companies pivoted from the consumer market to an enterprise/industrial market. This study illuminates several discursive tactics of cultural entrepreneurship – maintaining ambiguity, backstage truth-telling, pivoting as canon, etc. – that these companies deployed to perform the pivot. This study analyzes how these discursive tactics are used to bridge issues of legitimacy and identity that the act of pivoting can bring about. By better understanding a key institutional strategy in emerging IT fields, this study has important theoretical and practical implications for organizational communication and management literature.\n","Abstract Body: Large-scale, highly publicized organizational conflicts constitute organizational crises by threatening the normalcy and vitality of organizing. This study examines the case of toxic leadership within a megachurch, whose pastor and other leaders were over or founders of multiple organizations. Integrating 1) issue development within organizational conflict framing literature and 2) image restoration strategies within crisis communication literature, this study examines how issues were named, blamed, and claimed in public organizational texts during the outing of toxic leadership. Conclusions highlight the value of multiple and complimentary frameworks to analyze crisis communication, how issue development of public conflicts may affect the range of legitimate image restoration strategies available to organizations, stakeholders, and leaders, and how faith-based organizations may experience conflict framing and ethics failures differently, and, subsequently, necessitate different types of issues management and crisis response planning and strategies in response to abuse and coercion.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The European Union (EU) was founded to promote peace, prosperity and other fundamental European values between an increasing number of member states (European Commission, 2001). Brexit has activated a crisis of identity and reputation that adds to the refugee crisis and terrorism in reinforcing Euroscepticism (Börzel & Risse, 2018). The objective of the study is to identify the differences in the semantic construction and thematic framing of the European identity during a two-year period, pre- and post-Brexit, on a sample of 4712 tweets posted by the European Commission (EC). Findings show that in the pre-Brexit period, the EU is presented as an abstract political body, highly informative on major crisis, and reactively framing messages with values responsibility and solidarity. By contrast, after Brexit, the EC adapted its communication strategy to foster a sense of belonging to the EU by underlining a common transnational European identity and directed at upholding a corporate image of the EU. Twitter is thus being strategically used by such an organization to transmit its identity.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Prevalence of the incidence and effects of sexual assault and harassment in the workplace received worldwide attention in late 2017 as a result of the #MeToo movement. The purpose of this study was thus to investigate the extent to which perceptions that the #MeToo movement has led to increased hypersensitivity about sexual assault and harassment in the workplace can be explained by selective engagement with social media content about the movement and related sexual violence schemas. A total of 366 U.S. employees completed the relevant measures in an online survey. Results showed that the more participants engaged with information about the #MeToo movement on social media, the less they perceived the #MeToo movement as increasing hypersensitivity about sexual violence in the workplace. Findings indicate that hashtag movements such as #MeToo can serve as a powerful tool for confirmation bias particularly for reinforcing beliefs about sexual violence in the workplace.\n","Abstract Body: This study aims to understand the strategies entrepreneurs use to cope with knowledge ambiguity, specifically with the use of various media channels. Prior research demonstrates the importance of knowledge seeking on startup performance, but the process of accessing knowledge is less studied. Interview data were collected from 20 early stage entrepreneurs in the knowledge-intensive industries in the New York City metropolitan area. Five strategies emerged from the data coding: optimize information relevance, enhance communication efficiency, change in public visibility, increase awareness of knowledge, and access to indirect knowledge. Through analyzing the way entrepreneurs utilize media channels and engage with knowledge sources, this study sheds light on the communicative power of early stage entrepreneurs to overcome the barriers of accessing knowledge.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the influence of project team leaders’ external communication with stakeholders as well as project team members’ internal communication behaviors in multi-million dollar construction projects. This study also considers the impact of team information sharing behaviors on numerous team-level outcomes (e.g., decision-quality). In the main, whereas team information sharing was perceived as beneficial, project team leadership behaviors had a much more inconsistent impact on team-level outcomes. Moreover, and quite notably, subsequent interaction analyses indicated that project team leadership behaviors may sometimes be harmful if team members are already engaging in adequate levels of information sharing. The implications of these results and limitations of this investigation are further discussed.\n",null,"Abstract Body: In Distributed Agile Software Development (DASD), Agile software development principles are applied in a distributed setting. This creates an inherent tension, since DSD and ASD place conflicting requirements on how software development is organized. Where DSD builds on a plan-driven, systematic and structured approach, ASD by its nature is interactive, flexible, and focused on self-organizing teams. Based on an in-depth case study, we find that these inherent tensions lead to teamwork challenges within any of the eight teamwork dimensions (coordinating mechanisms and core components) of the Salas et al. (2005) model on which our study is founded. We also find that specific teamwork practices focused on shared understanding and practices, leveraging multiple communication channels, and stimulating mutual trust mitigate the extent to which these challenges emerge and affect collaboration in DASD teams. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on DASD, as well as the broader teamwork literature.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Although there is a substantial literature on nonprofit collaboration, most studies have focused on its antecedents and outcomes rather than on the process of collaborating. Previous studies have also paid only limited attention to the roles of communication and interpersonal relationships in this process. This study sought to address this gap in the literature by applying relational framing theory to nonprofit partnerships. Specifically, the study investigated connections between homophily (an antecedent variable); the use of affiliation and dominance frames in conversations between nonprofit partners (the communication/process variables); and the levels of trust, satisfaction, and perceived success in a partnership (the outcome variables). The results revealed that some types of homophily increased the use of dominance frames, though in general the effects of homophily were limited. Moreover, the use of dominance frames was negatively associated with all three outcomes, whereas the use of affiliation frames was positively associated with all three. Implications of these results for future studies of nonprofit collaboration are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This research explores how discourses of faith and values enable and constrain hospital chaplains in navigating significant organizational change within a large U.S. Catholic healthcare system. Using dialogic organizing as a conceptual framework, it explores tensions surrounding the enactment of spirituality in an explicitly religious organization. Findings are based on engaged, long-term, qualitative research with the department of hospital chaplains at one of the largest hospital sites in the system. The analysis centers on the ways that spirituality creates dialogic spaces for performing spiritual support, for conceptualizing holistic views of health and healing, and for navigating discourses of organizational change. Findings are discussed in relation to recent scholarship on dialogue and alternative organizing logics.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Virtual spaces are a new and influential means by which present and past organizational members share reviews of their organizational experiences and socialize potential newcomers. This investigation employed social identity theory and uncertainty management theory as a means of explaining patterned user ratings of organizational reviews online. In a first study, we content analyzed socialization storytelling about Basic Training on <i>americangrit.com<\/i>. Statistical analysis revealed that viewers rated stories more highly when the story portrayed the military favorably. In a second study, a content analysis of organizational reviews posted to <i>indeed.com<\/i> replicated and extended this pattern: Website visitors rewarded positive reviews of U.S. Military branches with higher ratings, while reviews of large corporate organizations (i.e., Apple, Bank of America, Michelin) varied.\n","Abstract Body: When a natural disaster—like a wildfire—strikes it impacts entire communities. Community leaders often look for ways to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of natural disasters.  Guided by theoretical perspectives on community resilience, and preventative health behavioral models, this study investigates disaster preparedness as a form of organizing.  We use a mixed-method intrinsic case study design to examine the planning, execution, and subsequent sensemaking around a community-wide wildfire drill.  Findings illustrate the interplay between communication, organizing, and individual preparedness as the community we studied conducted their drill in partnership with multiple emergency response organizations.  Our model explains 39% of the variance in individuals’ preparedness, with self-efficacy, people who were more involved with the community, and people who felt strong social norms around preparedness having more items prepared for a wildfire disaster. As we map the core communicative practices in this drill onto resiliency frameworks, we find that the desire to share the preparedness organizing process with external audiences is a unique contribution of this study.  We develop a conceptual model to synthesize the findings and guide future research.   <br />\n","Abstract Body: Organizational narrativity research has evolved since the linguistic turn to create a strong field of interest. However, most enquiries examine narrativity <i>within<\/i> organizations or between organizations and their publics. Few communication scholars take an empirical interest in what happens <i>between<\/i> organizations. This paper presents findings from a study of communication during collective action at the interface between firms in a supply chain in the French furniture sector. It examines the narrative practices of employees as they resolve interfirm issues in the virtual and material spaces where interpersonal engagement occurs. These analyses reveal how narratives within conversations generate “discursive objects that represent resources for action” (Hardy et al., 2005, p. 59). We then present a new conceptual model, the Collaborative Action Narrative Sequence (CANS), that captures how this narrativity integrates the social, temporal and material and virtual geographies to create collective action at the interfirm interface.\n","Abstract Body: In recent years, Chinese software companies have experienced exponential growth. As the industry gains considerable financial power, it is also taking action to participate in corporate social responsibility (CSR). One significant way through which Chinese software companies conduct CSR is cross-sectoral collaborations with nonprofit and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and governmental agencies. Drawing from Stakeholder Influence theory, this study analyzed Chinese software companies’ CSR collaboration networks and discovered some significant factors influencing their interorganizational network configuration. Three major findings emerged from the analysis. First, power and urgency, two central factors predicting stakeholder saliency, are useful to explain the structure of software companies’ CSR collaboration network. Second, in the political context of China, the local and central government agencies affected companies’ CSR stakeholder selections differently. Moreover, we also discovered that companies’ engagement in internet-related and general (not internet-related) social issues predicts their collaboration tie formation. Practical stakeholder management strategies were also provided.\n","Abstract Body: Despite the great utility of social media for improving organizational legitimacy, empirical evidence has revealed that organizations generally do a poor job adopting or using social media. Such seeming irrationality may be explored from a tension perspective, which posits that the dynamic interplay between the social construction of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and organizational tensions drives resistance to the adoption and use of ICTs. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 51 leaders of Chinese social ventures and two field experts, we seek to understand the dialectical tensions in social ventures’ social media use and how they manage such tensions. Our findings highlight that social venture leaders perceive four key tensions: (1) entry vs. maintenance, (2) visibility vs. invisibility, (3) conforming vs. strategic legitimacy, and (4) emancipation vs. control. Moreover, we found two broad strategies Chinese social ventures employed to manage these tensions: (1) strategic hiddenness, and (2) a networked, associative mechanism, which involves interorganizational and interpersonal relationship building with key actors. This research makes four theoretical contributions to research on organizational use of social media, organizational legitimacy, organizational tensions, and (social) entrepreneurship. Practical implications for social entrepreneurs and nonprofit leaders are also drawn from the findings.\n","Abstract Body: For employees who focus on external organizational communication, it is often challenging to interpret stakeholder feedback and determine the appropriate course for future action. Indeed, extant research has often overlooked how stakeholder feedback is incorporated into external organizational communication processes. In this context, there has been less emphasis on routines and job-related iterations related to external organizational communication, and specifically how individuals understand and apply digital analytics as a form of stakeholder feedback in the context of their jobs. Adaptive structuration theory provides a lens for understanding how employees within organizations use technology to communicate, and examines the feedback, expectations, and iterations that occur as a result. This further provides a means for understanding how digital data is interpreted by employees responsible for external communication, particularly when using information communication technology, or how organizations support or inhibit the use of feedback. This study examines interactions with external stakeholders and focuses on the resulting practices based on the digital analytic feedback they receive. Drawing from a series of interviews, the results of this study demonstrate that information communication technology and organizational norms can inhibit feedback loops that enable adaptive structuration processes.<br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>adaptive structuration theory, digital analytics, routines, external stakeholders, information communication technology<br />\n","Abstract Body: We study the effects of replacing an automated or human advisor with a different advisor over the course of 20 forecasting trials. Participants first completed 10 trials with one type of advisor (human/automated). For the following 10 trials, the participant was provided with a new advisor who was either the same type or different type as before (human/automated). Results show that automated advisors are trusted more immediately after they replace a human advisor compared to automated advisors that replace other automation. We also find that automated advisors are trusted less following the issuance of bad advice if the advisor has replaced a human. Additionally, automated advisors that replaced humans were rated as issuing lower quality advice, and human advisors that replaced automated advisors were rated as providing better quality advice. Results are discussed in the context of organizational decision-making, expectancy violations, contrast effects, and trust theory.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Organizations’ communication to publics on social media about who they are connected with (representational network) embodies their capacity of resource mobilization. Such capacity may be preceded and determined by other capacities of resource mobilization. To unravel whether and how this resource mobilization chain is enacted, a survey was conducted with 108 disaster risk reduction (DRR) organizations in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific regions, along with the longitudinal analysis of those organizations’ tag network on Facebook. The results of the stochastic-oriented actor models (SOAM) showed that for organizations with a lower level of external communication capacity, their organizational size and offline collaboration network (diversity) played a more important role in facilitating their engagement in the representational network on Facebook. In contrast, for organizations with a higher level of external communication capacity, their social media engagement and activity influenced the configuration of the representational network. Nonetheless, with a higher level of social media engagement, organizations’ representational network tended to be less diverse in terms of collaboration types. Moreover, this data also revealed the importance of social media activity in fostering cross-sector representational network ties for organizations, irrespective of their level of external communication capacity.\n",null,"Abstract Body: To fill the research gap and expand the body of knowledge on leadership and internal communication, the current study investigates the effect of servant leadership on communication satisfaction, employee-organization relationships (EORs), and employee advocacy. The study’s rationale is based on the social exchange theory in order to identify mediating mechanisms through which servant leadership encourages employees to engage in advocacy behaviors that go beyond their work obligations. Through a web survey of 777 employees working in medium and large organizations in the United States, the study confirmed the relationship between servant leadership and communication satisfaction, and that supervisory communication satisfaction is positively related to EORs. Additionally, the study also provides empirical evidence for the relationship between servant leadership and employee advocacy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study combines feminist standpoint theory with the organizational socialization process to explore how future and current employees evaluate ethical leadership in ethically ambiguous employee-manager exchanges. The experiment exposes male and female US participants to scenarios with male or female managers, and asks them to evaluate the manager’s traits, behaviors, and ethical leadership. Results indicate that employee and manager sex play a large role in evaluations of ethical leadership, that managers should abstain from inviting employees to drinks as a getting-to-know-you activity, and that male managers need to acknowledge women’s standpoints to foster socially responsible workplaces.   <br />\n","Abstract Body: Despite growing in volume, the literature on ethical leadership is largely detached from communication and the workplace context. This study examines the communicative constitution of ethical leadership, and in so doing, explores the features of ethical leaders in organizations. Conducted within the context of a multi-ethnic workplace in Malaysia, this study reveals three categories of communicative features of leaders who are perceived to be ethical: communicating visible action, communicating with openness, and communicating ethical values.\n","Abstract Body: There is increasing interest in the study of questions of agency in organization studies and organizational communication research more specifically, yet much of this research still tends to “entify” beings and things. To address this issue, this theoretical paper presents a new perspective on agency that deepens existing relational views of agency by drawing on and extending Gilbert Simondon’s little-known philosophical writings on individuation, communication, and information. This perspective is useful for organizational researchers because (1) it provides a new conceptual framework for studying organizations and processes of organizing from a post-humanist and new materialist perspective; (2) contributes to scholarship on the communicative constitution of organizations by viewing agency as grounded in the genuine equation of organizing and communicating; (3) helps refine theorizing of classical management and organization concepts, such as <i>boundaries<\/i>, <i>authority<\/i>, <i>power<\/i>, and <i>meaning<\/i>; and (4) has important methodological implications, because it denies the <i>a priori<\/i>, ex-communication existence of entities, including the existence of organizational researchers themselves.\n","Abstract Body: In the world where using digital technologies have become ubiquitous and self-evident part of our living, the big questions are related to digital platforms, smart algorithms, and artificial intelligence (AI). Even though the effects of emerging digital technologies and AI are already real, and some aspects of them have been studied, the viewpoint of organizing has not yet been discussed thoroughly. Platform economy, and especially algorithms and agency, we argue, should be of interest of organizational communication scholars who want to understand contemporary organizational contexts. The aim of this paper is to present the importance of studying digital platforms from organizational communication perspective. We highlight the macro economical viewpoint of platform economy, describe distinct features of algorithms and how they affect organizing, and finally highlight some themes that should be studied in the field of organizational communication.\n","Abstract Body: Employees’ work-related communication in social media, and particularly their advocacy behavior, has become a competitive factor for today’s organizations. Employees can increase brand visibility, foster thought leadership and position themselves as industry experts by communicating through social media. The importance of employees’ work-related communication activity has increased across all industries, and has become critical among knowledge-intensive organizations in particular, as they are inherently dependent on their employees’ ability to demonstrate their expertise. This exploratory qualitative analysis focuses on increasing understanding of the management of employees’ work-related communication in knowledge-intensive organizations. A total of 23 semi-structured interviews were conducted among organizational leaders working with employee communication programs in six different professional companies operating in Finland. As a result, three different management approaches that guide and enable employees’ work-related communication were identified. To this end, the article contributes to the emerging employee communication behavior discussion and to the wider field of communication management literature.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Project Overview<br />In a globalized business environment, organizations of all sizes are increasingly operating in multicultural workplace and competing in the global markets (Washington, 2013). According to projections by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2012, the U.S. will cease to have a major racial group by the middle of the twenty-first century. A diverse workforce can yield several significant competitive advantages for organizations, such as better business solutions derived from distinctive ideas (Gupta, 2008; Bovee & Thill, 2010) and accelerated growth in business portfolios (Kochen, 2003). However, team cultural differences can also cause conflict, misunderstanding and poor professional performance if not properly managed (Shenkar & Zeira, 1992). These findings call for proper interventions that help organizations facilitate effective team communication and collaboration to best mine the benefits of workplace diversity.<br />Previous research has found that cultural empathy, as a key dimension in the cross-cultural communication competence model, is the most important psychological predisposition for effective cross-cultural communication (Kim, 1986). A culturally empathetic team member holds a spirit of inquiry and openness to other cultures and different communication patterns, an appreciation and understanding of different working styles, and the capacity to behave “as though he or she understands the world as team members from other cultures do” (Matveev & Nelson, 2004, p.258). Cultivating cultural empathy can help individual business managers improve their problem-solving and decision-making capabilities in the global markets (Matveev & Nelson, 2004). At the organizational level, increasing cultural empathy and cross-cultural communication competence positively impacts the overall team performance (Earley & Mosakowski, 2000).<br />Currently, organizations have developed several different strategies to enhance cross cultural communication competence among team members, such as incorporating team diversity training programs (Kochen, 2003), emphasizing cohesive team culture (Elron, 1997) etc. However, few programs focus on educating and supporting empathetic team communication in a sustainable way. This study aims at filling this gap by proposing a mindfulness meditation approach which aims to help team members develop stronger cultural empathy towards each other, and enhance their communication skills through mindfulness meditation.<br />Mindfulness is defined as a state of mind characterized by a non-judgmental focus on the present moment (Block-Lerner, Adair, Plumb, Rhatigan, & Orsillo, 2007; Kabat-Zinn, 1994).<br />Studies have found that both neurological (Cahn & Polich, 2006) and empirical evidence (Greason & Cashwell, 2011) positively associated mindfulness practices with augmented empathetic functioning. Existing mindfulness meditation routines adopt diverse approaches, with some focusing on breathing, some on empathy, and some on gratitude, among others. While more evidence has been accumulated about the general benefits of various types of meditation on people’s emotional well-being, to the best of our knowledge, no study has explored how mindfulness meditation can help group members overcome cultural differences. This study will compare the impact of various meditation routines on growing group members’ ability to communicate with others in a more empathetic fashion, particularly those from different cultural backgrounds.<br />Study Design<br />To test our ideas, we plan to run an experiment comparing how different mindfulness meditation routine can influence effectiveness in intercultural communication. Participants will be recruited from a university in the Northeast region of the U.S. for course credits. Prior to their participation in the semester-long experiment, their intercultural communication competence will be measured as a baseline for intervention evaluation. Students will then be assigned to different meditation conditions, including (1) mindfulness meditation on breathing, (2) mindfulness meditation on empathy, and (3) mindfulness meditation on helping behaviors/mentality. Participants will be taught and reminded to do the meditation practices daily for a month before putting them in intercultural groups to work on collaborative tasks. Perceived empathy, effectiveness in intercultural communication and group performance will be measured. Comparisons and contrasts across conditions will be made to evaluate the value of various mindfulness meditation routines in supporting intercultural communication in project teams.<br />Potential Contributions<br />Enhancing employee empathy and facilitating empathetic team communication can have profound implications for business performance as well as the psychosocial environment of organizations in today’s multicultural environment. This study will contribute to understanding the psychological and communicative impacts of mindfulness meditation. The findings can be applied to advance the team communication practices in dynamic organizational settings.\n","Abstract Body: In any organizational context (Jablin, 1987), a common need is to find a manner of preparing new members to eventually become integrated into the culture and practices that are normative for employees at the workplace. Faculty members at universities enter into positions with unique skills and training, having often just emerged from a graduate (i.e., MA, MS, MFA, or Ph.D.) program that includes instruction in research or creative activity and teaching skills. Colleges and universities face a critical need in not only attracting but retaining quality faculty members who will dedicate decades to the instruction of students and production of research and/or creative works. In the present study, the new faculty retreat at a large, Western, public university, was selected for inclusion as a single case examination of faculty perceptions of fit and inclusion from a newcomer perspective. A group of 28 new faculty members served as the sample for this case study.\n","Abstracts: Participants (listed alphabetically) and Presentation Focus<br /><br />Oana Albu, University of Southern Denmark<br /><i>Dr. Albu’s research takes a communication-centered perspective and uses ethnographic methods to examine how human rights networks organize in conflict zones (e.g., Western Sahara, Lebanon and Palestine). One of her recent research projects focuses on the new forms of control and surveillance introduced by information and communication technologies in dangerous work contexts in which organizing is intimately related to questions of visibility/invisibility.<\/i><br /><br />Kirsten Foot, University of Washington<br /><i>Dr. Foot’s research on efforts at organizing cross-sector collaboration to counter human trafficking has required trust-building with two types of actors that can be difficult to access: law enforcement agents and survivors. Although differing in obvious ways, members of both types often share a reluctance to interact with social researchers for multiple reasons, including fears that they will be misunderstood and/or misrepresented as well as security needs.<\/i><br /><br />Brittany L.

Such investment often comes as a result of the venture being legitimated by stakeholders. Exhibiting a favorable identity is one path to securing legitimation. This study identified and defined multiple components of entrepreneurial identity and compares them to the preferences of legitimating audiences. A qualitative analysis of 55 in-depth interviews revealed 13 sub-units of entrepreneurial identity. Nine of these sub-units were perceived as legitimating while three were viewed to be delegitimating. These findings extend contemporary scholarship on entrepreneurial identity and legitimacy by showing how smaller elements of entrepreneurial identity may integrate or compete with each other as well as strengthen or weaken legitimacy appeals. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examined Chinese employees’ identity tensions in multinational companies (MNCs) and how they engaged in identity work to manage identity tensions. Multiple identities enhanced employees’ social bonding (Ashforth & Mael, 1989) in MNCs while they clashed, competed, or conflicted. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with 20 Chinese volunteer participants in MNCs located in China. A modified constant comparative analysis revealed four identity tensions: work-life challenges, member-leader transition, friend-professional switch, and cultural-work challenge. Participants engaged in various identity management strategies that included passive observational learning, as well as a set of functional (Compartmentalization, avoidance, and reframed integration), rhetorical (disclaimers, defense, venting, making clarifications, and self-deprecating jokes), and sensegiving identity work tactics. <br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Guided by liminality theory, this study investigates graduate students’ parenthood experiences based on 30 in-depth interviews. We found that graduate student parents (GSPs) were situated in multiple intertwined liminalities—social space “betwixt and between the original positions arrayed by law, custom, convention and ceremony” (Turner, 1977, p. 95) . GSPs experienced liminalities structurally as their both/neither student and employee statuses prevent them from taking advantage of universities’ (paid) leave policies; relationally as they feel marginalized and stuck in limbo statuses—always working parents, never ideal graduate students; and temporal-spatially as GSPs traverse work-family boundaries to enact roles and identities fluidly in time and space as they labor to earn Ph.D.s while raising their children. We contribute to theory and practice by foregrounding multidimensional constitutions of liminalities and pivoting as a key process for liminars to navigate the constraining and creative potentials of liminalities.\n","Abstract Body: Employees’ work-related stress is detrimental to organizational productivity and morale.  Seventy-five percent of Americans believe they have experienced a higher level of stress compared to older generations. Among Asian Americans, health disparities are present not only for lower socioeconomic classes but also for the middle class.  Stress symptoms are less reported and the least treated among this population.  This alarming phenomenon deserves immediate attention, and Asian Americans should maintain a healthy work-life balance. This qualitative research interviews 18 Asian American professionals who are current employees in various organizations.  The research questions ask how Asian American professionals perceive the relationship between organizational culture and work-related stress, how they make sense of sense of their organizational identities and perceived stress and the generational differences among Asian American professionals regarding job satisfaction, organizational identity and enculturation.  Seven themes emerged and discussions follow. <br />\n","Abstract Body: In everyday work, individuals often engage in opportunistic conversations when they happen to see each other. These spontaneous, unplanned conversations enable individuals to develop alliances, become part of collectives, and turn segmented actions into collective efforts. Through multiple, interrelated unplanned conversations, individuals constitute the very structuring of organizations. Given the structuring and organizing capabilities of unplanned conversations, the primary goal of this paper was to develop a multi-level model of the frequency and outcomes of unplanned conversations. Using a multi-methodological approach, a total of 5,297 unplanned conversations of N = 61 employees were recorded over a four-week period. Results of the study indicate that individuals’ technical expertise, perceived time pressure, and team psychological safety significantly predict individuals’ frequency of unplanned conversations. Additionally, the frequency of unplanned conversations significantly predicts information sharing quality among members. The paper concludes with a discussion of the key findings, implications, and directions for future research.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores how hospital leaders can craft safety and risk messages that will compete with the high volume of other messages in hospital organizations and overcome the communication noise in hospital workers’ lives. We use a multi-step thematic analysis of interview (<i>N<\/i>=12) and focus group (<i>N<\/i>=8, 28 participants) data collected from hospital workers to analyze how specific organizational communication channels contribute to workers’ perceived communication overload. We specifically examine how the affordances and constraints workers associate with each channel for sending/receiving safety information contribute to perceived communication overload. Results demonstrate asynchronous channels like email and voicemail increase perceived communication overload, while synchronous channels, like team huddles, alleviate it. We discuss how these results can expand Stephens and colleague’s (2017) communication overload model by pointing to new dimensions, including perceived communication power dynamics and violations of communication channel preference. Additional theoretical implications and study limitations are offered.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Small talk—superficial, trivial communication—is ubiquitous in the workplace. Yet, little is known about small talk at work, and research suggests it may have either positive or negative outcomes. This research draws on Interaction Ritual Theory to conduct three complementary studies. Study 1 (n=367) develops and validates a multidimensional scale to measure workplace small talk. In Study 2, open-ended responses from employed adults recruited through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform (n=244) is analyzed to determine why employees have small talk. In Study 3, survey responses from employees in multiple industries (n=580) are analyzed using latent profile analysis to determine whether certain combinations of small talk types and motivations impact employees’ ego depletion and interpersonal citizenship behaviors. The results of these studies suggest that small talk is a multidimensional phenomenon, and that its impact on employees vary based on motivations for conducting small talk and the nature of the discourse.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: The paper examines the implications of global visibility discourses and technologies in postcolonial country contexts. Building on postcolonial studies and a communication centered perspective, the paper put forwards a framework that illustrates how visibility discourses and technologies constitute a third space where the identities of the colonized and the colonizer are created and/or resisted. Empirically, the paper uses a multiple case study of two NGOs operating in Morocco and ethnographic methods. The findings indicate that a communication centered understanding of postcolonialism casts a novel outlook on how the distributed agency of visibility discourses and technologies provides unique opportunities as well as challenges (e.g., invisibility, humanitarian surveillance, etc.) that affect the work of NGO workers. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for upcoming research to question how and if visibility discourses and technologies could be employed responsibly in postcolonial settings to assist those in need, prevent abuse, and protect people from harm.\n","Abstract Body: Prior research has yielded mixed findings regarding the influence of institutional complexity on hybrid organizations. Although some organizations blend multiple logics well for positive innovation, others may experience extensive conflict that results in crises, failures, and even organizational demise. To address this puzzle, this research examines <i>when<\/i> and <i>how<\/i> the dialectical tensions that emerge from multiple institutional logics influence organizational innovation. Integrating the institutional theory of organizational communication and recombination-based innovation framework, this research investigates how a hybridity of social and market logics influence innovation outcomes for social ventures. Program officers from three foundations assessed the <i>novelty <\/i>and <i>quality <\/i>of social innovation ideas reported in survey responses from 318 nascent nonprofit organizations, social enterprises, and benefit corporations in the United States. Structural equation modeling results provided support for the mediated moderation model proposed in this research. The perceived degree of <i>(in)<\/i><i>compatibility<\/i> and<i> centrality<\/i> of social and market logics interact with each other to determine the novelty and quality of social innovations. Moreover, an organization’s entrepreneurial orientation fully mediates the relationship between institutional complexity and organization innovation. This study advances research on institutional theory of organizational communication, organizational innovation, hybrid organizing, and social entrepreneurship. It also has important practical implications for nonprofit leaders and social entrepreneurs.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Studies examining the predictors of interorganizational relationships have used new analytic frameworks to examine the patterns of relations among civil society and developments actors like NGOs. However, much of this research has relied on secondary data and binary relations. In this paper, we re-examine the assertions made in previous research by utilizing a primary data source to examine predictors of interorganizational relationship network formation. Second, we employ valued exponential random graph modeling (VERGM) to model the valued multiplex relationships rather than binary uniplex relationships. The finding from this study raises important questions about the mechanisms that influence network formation. For instance, the results suggest that endogenous factors like transitivity vary by the type of relationship and preferential attachment, a mechanism for explaining network centralization, does not explain the network structure found using primary valued relational data. Moreover, this study lends support to previous work on the role of homophily in interorganizational networks but the results also suggest that multiplexity and the type of homophily varied in their association with the strength of the relationships. Implications for interorganizational network are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations (NPOs)’ Twitter use by examining the effects of different message factors on the first and second levels of public engagement. Recent tweets from 100 top U.S. NPOs were collected for the analysis (n= 301,564). Using a big data approach and negative binomial regression models, we investigated how message factors and social issue sectors predict public engagement on a digital platform. Results indicated that the interactivity features, visual content, and emotions are significant predictors of NPO’s public engagement, at both first level (i.e., number of likes) and second level (i.e., number of retweets). Public engagement varies across different nonprofit issue sectors. Noticeably, financial accountability predicted public engagement only at the second level. NPOs in the issue sector of public affairs demonstrated the strongest public engagement at both levels. This study contributes to the nonprofit and social media literature by providing empirical evidence on message effects and effectiveness based on online behavior data. Practical implications regarding strategic social media use in the nonprofit sector are provided.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: Social media, Big Data, Nonprofit Communication, Public Engagement.\n","Abstract Body: Transparency is a complex and multifaceted communication phenomenon. In an era of digital ubiquity, demands for organizational transparency now come from a wide range of entities we term <i>visibility agents<\/i>-- ranging from NGOs and global networks on one hand, to activist coalitions and automated surveillance agents on the other.  Environmental reporting is one of the most prominent transnational areas of transparency management, so in this paper, we develop a framework to conceive of such visibility agents in the context of environmental issues and controversies, and examine the range of transparency demands that these entities make. We posit that such visibility agents significantly shape and diversify transparency practices in the current era and identify four major relationships between visibility agents and organizations-- inquisitorial, adversarial, associative, and advocative—which are associated with specific lenses of transparency: accountability, monitoring, disclosure, and opacity. We illustrate each set of relationships with examples of environmental reporting practices, one of the most prominent areas of transparency management. Implications for both theory and research on transparency are discussed. <br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: It is critical to foster employee voice—promotive behavior that emphasizes constructive challenge geared toward improvement—for positive organizational change and development. This study examines potential antecedents of employee voice, including social status and organizational justice. To pursue this goal, we investigate the influences of formal, informal, and self-perceived status as well as the effects of interpersonal and procedural justice. The results demonstrate that: (a) age, an informal status cue, was positively associated with challenging promotive voice; (b) self-perceived social status was positively linked to challenging promotive voice; (c) both interpersonal and procedural justice increased challenging promotive voice; and (d) interpersonal justice moderated the relationship between self-perceived status and challenging promotive voice such that the effect of status was less pronounced when perceptions of interpersonal justice was higher. The findings highlight the significance of structural influences on voice behavior, calling for further research on status disparities, organizational justice climate, and employee engagement.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper positions diversity work as an object of study within organizational contexts, and calls upon scholars of organizations to utilize decolonial theorizing in order to extend postcolonial conceptualizations of organizations.  I introduce the notion of the coloniality of organizations as a means of exploring how organizations structure ongoing settler colonial projects in the United States.  Specifically, I examine a diversity strategic plan as a particular genre, or familiar form, of diversity work.  A decolonial analysis of the diversity strategic plan reveals how diversity work enacts inclusive erasures through mobilizing discourses of diversity, belonging, and accountability, (re)producing coloniality as a normalizing regime.  I suggest that the coloniality of organization reveals the ways in which colonialism operates as an organizing logic in relation to organization and diversity work.\n","Abstract Body: Constant connectivity is viewed as an almost inherent by-product of work in the contemporary, technology-saturated global age. However, connectivity norms are likely to vary across locations, creating new tensions in global work due to uneven expectations and pressures. Drawing on a sample of global workers (N = 976) in a large logistics company, this study examines three different pressures – technological functionalities, co-worker norms, and work engagement – that may drive employees to stay connected to work. The findings indicate that overall co-worker norms are the strongest predictor of constant connectivity; however, European workers seem to be especially affected by these norms in relation to constant connectivity. Furthermore, this study indicates that collaborative tools that rely on synchronous communication are significantly related to constant connectivity, whereas, asynchronous functionalities of the same platforms are not. Finally, across all groups, work engagement is a strong predictor of constant connectivity, suggesting that constant connectivity may be more voluntary than previously thought (i.e., a result of feeling fulfilled in one’s work, rather than a response to external compulsion). Implications of these findings for theory and practice are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Drawing on the institutional logics and discursive resources perspective, I examine the organizing practices of two shelters that serve homeless women in the same area. In my analysis, I argue that a Discursive approach to institutional logics has much to offer in examining organizational heterogeneity as these organizations enact their social welfare mission. Using comparative ethnographic methods, I examine how each organization sought to enact a social welfare institutional logic, and how that enactment resulted in more normative or alternative organizing practices. At one organization the social welfare institutional logic was translated into getting clients ‘back on track’ while at the other shelter it was translated as practicing ‘hospitality.’ I argue that these translations served as primary discursive resources that both enabled preferred organizational practices and productively maintained tensions between conflicting Discourses.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Whether victims of workplace sexual harassment voice their abuse or remain silent has implications for both organizations and victims. This study surveyed (<i>N <\/i>= 187) victims and observers of workplace sexual harassment to assess how harassment type, medium, and voicing behaviors impact victims’ resilience and perceived vulnerability to future harassment. The study also examined the impact of organizational (in)tolerance of sexual harassment on both victims’ and observers’ organizational withdrawal and perceived vulnerability to future harassment. Findings show that victims’ resilience decreases when victims formally report their sexual harassment and when victims withdraw from their organizations, which is more likely to occur in organizations that are perceived as tolerant of sexual harassment. Results also show that observing sexual harassment had no effect on perceptions of organizational tolerance of sexual harassment. Theoretical and practical implications for organizations attempting to address the problem of sexual harassment are offered.\n","Abstract Body: Preceding the August 19, 2014 beheading of U.S. freelance journalist James Foley by just twelve days, the global youth media corporation, Vice Media, released a feature-length documentary titled <i>The Islamic State<\/i> on YouTube. The 43-minute video featured footage shot by freelance reporter, Medyan Dairieh, as he embedded with Islamic State militants travelling through occupied territories in Iraq and Syria over the course of three weeks. Oscillating between interviews with a range of (male) subjects, observational footage tracking through various gatherings and patrols, and short video clips seemingly sourced from Islamic State media networks, the video tells a story of increasing militarization and unrelenting expansion. Despite some ensuing debate over the legality and potential journalistic ramifications of Vice’s participation and dissemination of a rather controlled tour through IS territory, in April 2015, Vice’s <i>The Islamic State <\/i>took home a Peabody Award. While the story of Vice and the Islamic State seems, from this vantage, to already include a number of interesting contradictions, questions, and controversies, I offer in this essay that the release of <i>The Islamic State<\/i> and its subsequent valorization via the Peabody Awards offers a glimpse into many of the broader structures and dynamics that characterize our current digital culture. In order to think more critically about regimes of image production, circulation, and consumption as they intersect with the shifting dynamics of insurgency and the mediation of insurgent voices, this paper pursues a perhaps polemical, but not entirely unfeasible claim: Vice News’ <i>The Islamic State<\/i> can be read as a site of the collision between two emerging media brands in their prime, each hoping to extend and expand their reach and cultural influence. Considering both Vice’s and IS’ approaches to branded storytelling draw upon the same aesthetic tropes of “immersion” and pushing the edge of taste and comfortability on screen, I argue that these appeals to sensorial, and often non-cognitive experience (what I will later define as viscerality) are deeply tied to capitalist underpinnings of digital culture. Not only does visceral content move more easily by “cutting through the noise of the internet” through its appeal to affective response, but it also can function more successfully as a mobilizing force when tied to a technologized brand logic that directs affects towards feelings of community, in these two cases creating alternative worldviews based on aggressive and oppositional positionalities.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Through the case study of “identity resolution”, a practice of matching disparate data sources in the hopes of identifying an individual, this paper posits a theory of queer data. After historicizing the ways in which sovereign states and markets have constructed citizens and audiences as datafied subjects, this paper explores the way data brokers conceive one’s digital identity. I argue the data industries are bound by a certain failure, always one step behind, trying to anticipate your identity and solve for it retrospectively at the same time. In this way, our “data doubles” (Fourcade & Healy, 2015), “algorithmic identities” (Cheney-Lippold, 2017), or digital “proxies” (Steyerl, 2014) never quite represent us, but are an assemblage of data crumbs, which come to form some ghostly version of our digitally captured actions. The identity that data brokers construct out of these digital traces never quite fit its subject. While some may see this as a flaw in the algorithm, I see this failure (Halberstam, 2011) as creating potential for algorithmic identities to move beyond binary tendencies and logics of segmentation, toward a less resolute and more relational view of identity—this is something I call <i>queer data<\/i>.\n","Abstract Body: While a wave of recent scholarship has grappled with the defining features of the political economy of data-driven media technology platforms and its impact on digital labor, politics, and social and cultural practices, the precise way(s) in which this political economy reproduces itself requires further examination. This paper theorizes several key moves in the reproduction of capitalism in datafied media systems. First, it considers the relationship between affect/emotion and cognition, and the increasing role of technical cognition. It then describes how datafied media systems are affording new opportunities for neurodivergent humans, and drawing from developmental psychological literature, how across neurodiverse populations these media are becoming tools for technological self-regulation. Finally, it considers how this regulation becomes habitual within spaces of capture for datafied capitalism, pushing the reproduction of relations of production beyond ideology.\n","Abstract Body: <br />Facebook advertising has increasingly played a central role in political life. Hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on political ads on Facebook. Facebook has been successful in attracting political advertisers as a result of its ability to algorithmically infer highly specific user interests and use these to make users available for ad targeting. The purpose of this paper is to interrogate the algorithms that enable user classification on Facebook, with a particular focus on exploring how the functioning of classifications shapes the way users can become visible on the platform. Classification systems—algorithmic or otherwise—construct a particular description of reality by nature of the way they result from a nexus of human choices and motivations. We conduct a case study in which we explore how the discourses inscribed in Facebook’s classification system for ad targeting structures strategic political speech--whom can be reached and how. In particular, we focus on how this classification system entails processes of distortion—people and ideas are twisted, obscured, amplified, or silenced in the (political) discourse manufactured.\n","Abstract Body: Preceding the August 19, 2014 beheading of U.S. freelance journalist James Foley by just twelve days, the global youth media corporation, Vice Media, released a feature-length documentary titled <i>The Islamic State<\/i> on YouTube.

Considering both Vice’s and IS’ approaches to branded storytelling draw upon the same aesthetic tropes of “immersion” and pushing the edge of taste and comfortability on screen, I argue that these appeals to sensorial, and often non-cognitive experience (what I will later define as viscerality) are deeply tied to capitalist underpinnings of digital culture. Not only does visceral content move more easily by “cutting through the noise of the internet” through its appeal to affective response, but it also can function more successfully as a mobilizing force when tied to a technologized brand logic that directs affects towards feelings of community, in these two cases creating alternative worldviews based on aggressive and oppositional positionalities.<br />\n","Abstracts: This contribution to extreme speech theory and analysis aims to theorize the relationship of so-called post-truth society and politics (Harsin 2018) to negative emotions such as anger and fear. The theory derives especially from critical empirical work I've conducted on online French anti-gender theory groups (2018). Post-truth has become a staple of popular political and academic analysis across a transnational media and political space, from (non-exhaustively) politicians such as Trump, Bolsonaro, Duterte, Johnson/Farage and Le Pen, to anti-immigrant/nativist, misogynist and homophobic reactionary groups and movements. Importantly, post-truth is defined as having a particular emotional-epistemological relationship (<i>Oxford Dictionary<\/i>). While sometimes it is deemed a feature of populism, scholars have argued that hate, fear, and anger have been increasingly strategically produced, and circulated broadly, often quite effectively (Berry and Sobieraj, 2013). Traditionally masculine-associated emotions of anger linked with intimidation, aggressivity, and humiliation circulate around this communication style and, problematically from a critical perspective, build its credibility as “honest” authentic speech. One must ask, “why now?” Post-truth, I argue, has a conjuncturally specific emotionality.<br />Following Georg Simmel, I theorize public truth claims as a function of trust (“weak inductive” knowledge), which operate in a new regime of (post-) truth (Foucault) largely because professional/strategic promotional communication (including political varieties) has encouraged distrust through its own practices of objectifying citizen-populations and militarizing its communication in anti-democratic ethics-free strategies. Trust in truth-tellers/-claims today functions similarly to emotional truth (Redmond 2007; Dyer 2012) and emotional realism (Ang 1988), which studies of reality TV audiences have found operational in that entertainment setting (Hill 2007; Grindstaff 2008; Harsin 2018). Potential for professional exploitation of emotion is culturally, historically embedded (Ahmed 2004) possibilities for professionally (strategic communication is a profession), and it is also embedded specifically in the techno-social structures and habits of the attention economy. Cognitive scientific analyses of big data website traffic analysis suggest that aggro-truth speech is especially effective in the habits and techno-structures of social media that encourages brief but emotional, attention-getting posts and quick likes, shares, or angry (or jubilant) reactions (Harsin 2018). Today emotions are exploited in a performative indexical relationship to truth—they are the last vestiges of popular truth in promotional culture (Wernick 1991; Hearn 2011), which absorbs the political. Masculinist “aggro-truth” is emotional truth-telling in a conjuncture of insurgent misogyny, racism, and homophobia.\n","Abstracts: In a saturated media environment, often marked by problematic and insufficient coverage of social justice issues, social movements have turned to social media to maximize their chances of reaching broad audiences. That fact that “everybody is on Facebook now” has pushed activists to rely on this platform to reduce one of the uncertainties that marks organizing: how to get people involved. Drawing on a book-length project that examines how left-wing social movements in different countries approach digital technologies, I argue that contemporary activism is marked by an overreliance on Facebook as a way to wade through the uncertainties connected to organizing for social change. Yet, this overreliance only breeds more uncertainties.<br /><br />Through interviews with a US-based socialist organization and an anti-capitalist collective in Italy, I show that Facebook has become an all-encompassing infrastructure for activists’ mobilization and internal communication. While activists strongly criticize Facebook and even decide to personally abandon the platform, they nevertheless consider it the only viable option for their collective political struggle. Further, when activists explain their use of and relationship to digital technologies writ-large, what they say is often mediated by their experience with Facebook; Facebook has become their most tangible experience of “the internet” and the lens through which they think about the digital. I argue that these movements’ overreliance on Facebook paradoxically produces even more uncertainties: on the one hand, the inability to fully trust Facebook due to its policies and its politics; on the other, the uncertainty as to the possibility of transitioning to other digital technologies that could better align with their politics and support their political action.<br /><br />I argue that Facebook does not only hold an almost complete monopoly on the communication of many contemporary social movements, it also holds a monopoly on their imagination: it is increasingly difficult for activists to even begin imagining technological alternatives to Facebook. Thus, even if the power of Facebook is being undermined in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, its monopolistic position can have long-lasting repercussions on how we think about the role of technology in relation to social change.\n","Abstracts: This paper situates the emergence of deepfakes, a type of algorithmically derived synthetic media, as part of a longer visual history. In doing so, it highlights why and how popular discourses about deepfakes risk contributing to unfolding cultures of speculation where anything and everything can be dismissed as “fake.” Therefore, the paper moves away from the binary classification of images as “real” and “fake,” contending that uncertainty can be understood as an epistemological condition that cuts at the heart of visual meaning making.<br /><br />The rise of deepfakes has already introduced a new level of anxiety to prevailing societal concerns about the ability to respond meaningfully to viral deception and online disinformation campaigns. As part of a broader crisis about online information and its credibility, deepfakes are commonly portrayed as the new storm threatening the information landscape and the parameters under which deliberative democracy operates. The proposed solutions, both to demand responsibility and action on the part of social media platforms and to educate the public on how to detect deepfakes, are important. Yet they are also limited because such approaches fail to account for a larger question: why are responses to new visual technologies a repeated performance of fear about visual truth and falsehood? To tackle this question, the paper first discusses strategically chosen case studies involving diverse visual media from different time periods—oil paintings, film and digital photography, video and algorithmically-derived images—situating the discourses surrounding deepfakes within longstanding and wide-ranging concerns about the ability to manipulate visual imagery and the persuasive power of such materials. It then argues that uncertainty is crucial to how any image operates. To manage it, we need to accept visual modes of knowledge production—and all they entail—on their own terms, grappling with the potential power of not knowing.\n","Abstracts: This paper argues that emerging technologies of datafication are intensifying a moralisation of predictivity. This entails not only the injunction to know and control whatever was previously left uncertain and open, but also the demand that human subjects learn to live in more predictable and machine-readable ways. Drawing on a book-length project, this paper examines how messy data, arbitrary classifications, and other uncertainties are manufactured into the status of reliable predictions.<br /><br />Specifically, I examine the public presentation of data-driven surveillance systems over the last decade, focusing on the rise of counter-terrorist sting operations in the United States. Attacks like the Boston bombings and the Vegas shootings have been accompanied by formulaic public retrospectives, agonising over how the individuals must have been radicalised and how they could have been stopped with better data. I argue that this insistence on predictivity reflects a broader faith in data as pure and sanitising — interacting all too well with the older fantasies of national and racial purity that scholars like Jasbir Puar have identified in the war on terror.<br /><br />At the same time, I show how the actual practice of data-driven surveillance, such as FBI sting operations, reveals not technological certainty but the political and moral pressure to predict the ‘lone wolf’. The algorithmic performance of objectivity and control is further replicated in growing public-private partnerships for surveillance. Amazon Ring’s aggressive data-sharing with local law enforcement spearheads a broader corporate strategy for cultivating a new Faustian bargain between customer convenience and frictionless data extraction.<br /><br />These sites illustrate how the moralisation of predictivity helps suture the many imperfections of algorithms and AI, and provide justificatory cover for its breakneck expansion. They perpetuate the normative expectation that what can be predicted must be predicted, and what needs to be predicted surely <i>can <\/i>be. Ultimately, such technologies entail a gradual shift in what counts as knowledge, and who (or what) has the right to declare the truth of a person.\n","Abstracts: In recent communication literature, there has been a growing focus on uncertainty as a political by-product of algorithmic governance and digital hermeneutics. In this paper, I explore authoritarian communicative strategies of disseminating doubt: how they precede web 2.0 and how they have thrived with the rise of social media and digital convergence.<br /><br />I examine the case of Syria, particularly a word in Syrian dialect: ‘Ilak, which roughly translates to “chewed talk”. It describes long-winded rants— as if invoking people moving their jaws to chew gum rather than to communicate. ‘Ilak is also commonly used to describe authoritarian discourse that strategically fills up mediated space with empty words that obscure what is going on.<br /><br />Investigating the Syrian regime strategy, I discuss episodes that showcase the mediation of uncertainty by spreading rumours, uncanny characters and contradictory claims. I start with the 2005 assassination of former leader Rafiq Hariri in Lebanon, which Syria was accused of orchestrating. The slogan that the Lebanese espoused to hold the perpetrators accountable was “the truth.” However, that truth was never exposed. Looking back, we can see how key witnesses filled media with “chewed talk” and then were discredited.<br /><br />The same tactics were advanced as the uprising and civil war unfolded. Since 2011, there have been high profile cases of key witnesses, activists and victims, who captured public attention filling media space with talk and visuals and then turning out not to be who they were thought. The pattern is akin to blowing a bubble gum balloon and then simply chewing it again when it bursts.<br /><br />From 2005 to 2019, the media and techno-scapes drastically changed. Authoritarian strategies quickly adapted to new technologies. Social media, with its proliferation of user voices and images, and its algorithmic logic, has facilitated the extent and the speed to which a paralyzing uncertainty could be pushed through. By centring authoritarianism, and examining the same strategy but different tactics before and after web 2.0, I aim to show the continuities in media-adaptive authoritarian bubble gum politics and the need to resist it.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Until the end of the last century, media sociology was synonymous with an investigation of mass media implications for society but a lot has changed in recent years. If we talk about media today, we may also have legacy mass media such as newspapers or television in mind, however, for an increasing number of people media are comprised of various digital platforms such as Instagram, Facebook or Netflix. Even when we talk about newspapers and television, these no longer take the form of legacy mass media, but have taken on new digital arrangements and have, therefore, fundamentally changed in a variety of ways. This paper discusses what this change in the media environment into the digital means for media sociology. To describe it in a little more detail, it reflects how media sociology changed from a sociology of mass communication to the sociology of a deeply mediatized world. This poses media sociology with three challenges, first, a rethinking of agency is required, second, there is a need to think about redefining social relations, and third, attempts should be made to rediscover order in the digital realm.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper interrogates the strategic role of imagined futures in the social life of digital technologies. It argues that the prevalence of repeated, deferred futures acts as a vehicle for stagnation and conservatism in the kind of values and social order facilitated by those technologies. As a case study, the paper examines the contemporary popularisation of ‘smart’ machines (c.2012-) through the lens of earlier enthusiasm for ubiquitous computing (1991-1999), or ‘ubicomp’. Widely attributed to Mark Weiser and colleagues at Xerox PARC, ubicomp promised a near future in which computers would ‘disappear’ into the background of life. Today’s smart technology consciously echoes ubicomp’s ideas, language, and even signature products like the Internet-connected fridge. Here, past futures are strategically recycled for meaning and legitimacy. Yet this very repetition hints at a constant deferral: an elastic temporality made up of failed startups and unbuilt prototypes, where the repetition of technical concepts is mirrored by a repetition of their underlying moral values and social concepts. Even as the Roomba or smart fridge achieves clear technical advancements on their predecessors, the underlying social relations – such as gendered domestic labour – remains much the same.\n","Abstract Body: Based on a literature review, this paper shows that current mediatization scholarship is characterized by what Pike (1967) refers to as <i>etic<\/i> accounts. These accounts forward theoretical categories on media related social change to conclude that our age is characterized by deepened and expanded media dependency. However, such theoretical extrapolation takes place not from, but at the expense of, people’s lived experiences, that is, <i>emic<\/i> accounts of mediatization. This paper is an attempt to insert the etic/emic distinction to mediatization research in order to develop more reflexive and composite approaches. Drawing upon examples from a representative survey and qualitative interviews conducted over twenty years, the paper challenges etically derived conceptions of mediatization. The emic view, based on interview data on <i>perceived<\/i> media saturation and reliance, suggests that mediatization can be conceived differently in relation to different actors at different stages in history.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This article critiques the linear and simplistic view of technology transfer and proposes technology translation as an alternative conceptual model to understand traveling technologies. Different from the techno-centric approach of technology transfer, technology translation is conceptualized as a social-technical process of moving and translating technologies across boundaries. Drawing on science and technology studies, communication studies and translation studies, this article proposes a typology of technology flow models, including two transfer models and three translation models. Paying attention to the interactions between the social and the technical, this article discusses the politics of translation and elaborates how technology translation could be used as a conceptual model to make sense of the complexity and dynamics of technology flows. By foregrounding the role of translators, this article sets out to rethink the nature and path of technology flows, especially in the Global South.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: The aim of this paper is to reconstruct how the organizational elite of the Quantified Self and Maker movements curates their respective pioneer communities. Based on a media ethnography carried out in Germany, the UK and the USA it is demonstrated that the two movements represent different curatorial models: Curation through the use of an “unenforced trademark” in the case of the Quantified Self movement and curation through “franchising” in the case of the Maker movement. The fragility of both models is not necessarily a disadvantage to either but, ultimately, it contributed to the rapid global spread of each pioneer community. An analysis of the related curatorial practices demonstrates that while these communities like to present themselves as having emerged from local groupings, rising “from below”, they are, in fact, figurations whose origin and overall exertion of influence can be traced back to Silicon Valley and the Whole Earth Network.\n","Abstract Body: Defining citizenship as an ongoing process of civic identity formation and the building of civic agency, this paper explores how technologically mediated activities and experience of civic tech cultivate new form of civic identity—digital citizenship. To examine the emergence of digital citizenship, this research particularly focuses on civic tech, a global phenomenon in which individual citizens use digital media or data technologies for a large array of political or civic purposes. I Locate the rise of civic tech in the history and politics of South Korea where new forms of civic identity evolve transforming or embracing traditional norms of citizenship. Through an ethnographic research of civic tech groups and projects in Seoul, South Korea in 2016-2019, I examine how civic tech participants articulate their digital citizenship as a new form of civic identity through technologically mediated activities and experiences of civic tech.\n","Abstract Body: The article examines the role of social media groups for online freelance workers in the Philippines—digital workers obtaining ‘gigs’ from online labor platforms such as Upwork and Onlinejobs.ph—for social facilitation and collective organizing. The paper first problematizes labor marginality in the context of online freelance platform workers situated in the middle of competing narratives of precarity and opportunity. We then examine unique forms of solidarity emerging from social media groups formed by these geographically spread digital workers. Drawing from participant observation in online freelance Facebook groups, as well as interviews and focus groups with online freelance workers located in the cities of Manila, Cebu and Davao, we found that online Filipino freelancers maintain active social interaction and exchange that can be construed as “entrepreneurial solidarities”. These solidarities are characterized by competing discourses of ambiguity, precarity, opportunity, and adaptation that are articulated and visualized through ambient socialities. While we argue that these entrepreneurial solidarities do not reflect a passive acceptance of neoliberal discourses about digital labor by digital workers, the solidarities forged in these groups also work to undermine their resistive potential such that these tend to reinforce rather than impose pressure toward critical structural changes that can improve the viability of digital labor conditions.\n","Abstract Body: This article studies the online encyclopedia Wikipedia as a core example of the storage and sharing of commons-based digital materials. It focuses on the voluntary, day-to-day activities of its editors as they gather and transform digital information goods that are made available free of charge. Using the notion of articulation work, I stress the effort that goes into accommodating the engagement with the encyclopedia within the contributors’ media-suffused daily routines. Then, the article discusses the typical practices of transcribing, republishing, and relicensing through which the transition from non-free ownership to freely shared property is brought about. Finally, the freedom that is inherent in the modification of the legal status of ideas and artifacts and their public circulation requires us to interrogate the ethical implications of the digital commons collected and spread by Wikipedians.\n","Abstract Body: The political volatility prompted by the War on Terror and Edward Snowden’s revelations on digital mass surveillance have created immense pressure on political systems to redress contradictions between state security, transparency, and the right to privacy and freedom of speech. As noted in previous studies, discussions on state security and transparency are indispensable in the legitimations of surveillance. While mass surveillance infringes the fundamental rights, transparency and democratic oversight compensate the loss of privacy and freedom. When political discourse shifts explicitly towards patriotism and paternalism, however, the normalisation of surveillance supersedes critical reflection about its legitimacy and makes it banal.<br /> <br />While Snowden’s disclosures have provoked privacy advocates to call for more strict regulations, most citizens have accepted surveillance in terms of national security. In comparison to other countries, the connections between the Snowden revelations and Finnish intelligence laws have been rather thin and implicit. Given that Finland is neither a global power nor an intelligence giant, the Snowden revelations have had little do with ’us’. Instead, portraying itself as a haven of online privacy and cyber security, Finland has been one of the last countries in Europe drafting intelligence laws. This study focuses on the Finnish civil and military intelligence laws through policy documents, media debate and news coverage, and interviews with key stakeholders participating in the law making to tackle the banalisation of surveillance.\n","Abstract Body: The rise of blockchain as a techno-solution in the development sector underscores the critical imbalances of data power under ‘computational capitalism’ (Beller, 2018). This presentation will consider the political economy of techno-solutionist and blockchain discourses in the developing world, using as its object of study blockchain projects in Pacific Island nations. Backed by US state department soft power initiatives such as Tech Camp these projects inculcate tech-driven notions of economic and political development, or ICT4D, while opening up new terrains for data accumulation. Blockchain developers in search of proof of concept have found the development sector a fecund space for tech-experimentation as they leverage a desire for tech-development and exploit regulatory weakness. The material implications of blockchain projects and discourse has been to create governance solutions which bypass the developing world state as a largely corrupting intermediary. In the Pacific this has meant blockchain supply-chain management systems, concessions for blockchain special economic zones and an Asian Development Bank project to manage indigenous Fijian lands exclusively on the blockchain. In all these instances techno-solutionist development discourses have been deployed in aid of data enclosure and ‘platform imperialism’ (Yong Jin, 2015).\n","Abstract Body: “Infrastructure,” as a term and a keyword, is taken for granted in popular and academic discourse. Referring to both large socio-technical systems that invisibly subtend social worlds and, metaphorically, as any thing or system that can subtend a social world, \"\"infrastructure\"\" appears as an index of material and metaphorical things. Despite such obviousness, \"\"infrastructure\"\" has a relatively recent history, only appearing in the English language in the immediate post World War II period. How, why, and to what effects does this recently adopted word organize such large and important portions of the technological landscape? This paper offers a preliminary investigation into some of these questions by rehearsing and developing concepts useful for the examination of \"\"infrastructure\"\" as a keyword, namely infrastructural inversion, technological drama, and the closed world. Then, I use these concepts to examine archival material containing some the term's earliest usages in the English language--in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military discourse.\n","Abstract Body: Incarcerated individuals have long contributed to crucial societal infrastructures. From being leased work force building the railway in the US to constructing canal systems in Sweden, prisoners’ labor has been widespread as an important part of value production. Part of the labor conducted by incarcerated people is related to the production, repair and maintenance of media devices and media infrastructures constituting what we call prison media work. In this article, we trace the changing logics of prison media work historically since the inception of the modern prison at the turn of the 20<sup>th<\/sup>century. Based on archival material, interviews and field observations, we outline a shift from physical manual labor towards the work of being tracked that is constitutive of surveillance capitalism in- and outside of the prison. We argue that prison media work holds an ambiguous position combining elements of exploitation and rehabilitation, but most importantly it is a dystopian magnifying glass of media work under surveillance capitalism.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The purpose of this study was to develop a communication perspective, <i>community-of-difference perspective<\/i>, that will guide our understanding of various ways in which metropolitan city residents experience differences in their own neighborhoods. In the case studies of three Seoul neighborhoods, based on indepth interviews and focus group interviews, we found that differences in urban neighborhoods can be categorized into at least four types: <i>identity-based, value-based<\/i>, <i>action-based<\/i>, and <i>socio-spatial differences. <\/i>We were able to conceptualize two types of communication for dealing with differences: (1) <i>difference-reducing communication<\/i> (communication among those sharing identities, values, and action plans as resources to find and strengthen in-group connectedness while reducing, avoiding, or eliminating differences between groups); and (2) <i>difference-managing communication<\/i> (communication among those with differences that does not avoid, reduce, or ignore differences among local residents). Four different relational types were identified in the three study areas through examining various types of communication strategies: (1) <i>denial<\/i> (top-down, repressive relationship between powerful and weak groups); (2) <i>rivalry <\/i>(competitive relations among different groups): (3) <i>cohabitation <\/i>(safe distance from different others for survival); and (4) <i>coexistence<\/i> (preserving singularities while recognizing others’ differences).\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines the bounds of American citizenship through an study of one faith-based organization's rhetoric. It claims that the organization's efforts exist within a rhetorical tension. On the one hand, it advocates to expand the bounds of citizenship to the socially marginalized due to a faith-based narrative. On the other hand, it rhetorically reinforces a limited way in which to enact one’s citizenship that can exclude exactly those who the organization wishes to include. This paper aims to bring together theory on public spheres, recognition, citizenship, and civil religion to reorient conversations about religious activism with regards to the national imaginary from a focus on conservative Christians to examine the rhetorical efforts of the Religious Left.\n","Abstract Body: As a key approach to the study of language and social interaction within the field of communication, the ethnography of communication (EC) posits that speech communities value communication resources for their functions in the process of competent use. We argue that this conception of value creates theoretical blind spots for other types of value that derive from other processes besides competent use, such as the exchange and acquisition of communication resources. Drawing on recent anthropological scholarship and our own cross-cultural comparative case study of U.S. and Chinese students’ accounts of learning Anglo-American public speaking, we claim that, from an ethnographic perspective, a communication resource has value insofar as speakers interpret it as an object of desire due to its function as a means to other valued entities or focal values in the context of relevant social processes.\n","Abstract Body: People are more likely to seek out romantic partners who are politically similar to themselves. Nonetheless, romantic partners who disagree politically do exist. This study examines the influence of political (dis)similarity in romantic relationships on both political participation and relational satisfaction. By blending interpersonal and political communication research, this study advances our understanding of the interrelationships of relational processes and political action. In doing so, we found that (1) people in politically similar romantic relationships are more satisfied in their relationships than those who are in dissimilar relationships, (2) political similarity within romantic relationships only influences participation when communication dynamics are considered, and (3) while political conflict intensity has a negative association with relational satisfaction, it is positively related to political participation.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Political polarization on the digital sphere poses a real challenge to many democracies around the world. Although the issue has received some scholarly attention, there is a need to improve the conceptual precision in the increasingly blurry debate. The use of computational communication science approaches allows us to track political conversations in a fine-grained manner within their natural settings – the realm of interactive social media. The present study combines different algorithmic approaches to studying social media data in order to capture both the interactional structure and content of dynamic political talk online. We conducted an analysis of political polarization across social media platforms (analyzing <\/i><i>Facebook, Twitter, and WhatsApp), over 16 months and <\/i><i>slightly under a quarter million<\/i><i> online conversations<\/i><i> regarding a political controversy in <\/i><i>Israel. Our comprehensive measurement of interactive political talk enables us to address three key aspects of political polarization: (1) interactional<\/i><i> polarization –<\/i><i> homophilic versus heterophilic;<\/i><i> (2) positional polarization – the positions expressed, and (3) affective polarization – the emotions and attitudes expressed. Our findings indicate that we should not conceptualize <\/i><i>political polarization on social media as a unified phenomenon, as there are significant differences across platforms. While interactions on Twitter largely conform to established expectations (homophilic interaction patterns, aggravating positional polarization, pronounced inter-group hostility), de-polarization occurred over time on WhatsApp. Surprisingly, Facebook was found to be the least homophilic platform in terms of interactions, positions, and emotions expressed. Our analysis points to key conceptual distinctions and raises important questions about the drivers and dynamics of political polarization online. <\/i>\n","Abstract Body: Affective polarization is a key concern in contemporary American politics. Although past evidence suggests some ways to minimize it, there are no easily applicable interventions that are found to work after 2016. This project examines whether situationally induced happiness has the power to reduce affective polarization (i.e., misattribution of affect or “spillover effect”). On the flip side, happiness can minimize systematic processing, thus enhancing beliefs in misinformation. Three preregistered survey experiments in the US, Poland, and the Netherlands (total N = 5,777) induced happiness in three distinct ways. Happiness had no effects on affective polarization toward outparty, outparty supporters, and various social groups, and also on misinformation beliefs (conspiracy endorsement and beliefs that a deep fake was real). Two additional studies, Study 4 and 5 in the US and Poland (total N = 2,167) additionally induced anger and anxiety, confirming that all these incidental emotions had null effects. The findings, which emerged uniformly among different partisan and ideological groups and those for whom the inductions were differently effective, underscore the challenge of minimizing affective polarization in contemporary America and other Western countries.\n","Abstract Body: In this study we utilized a three-wave panel survey during the 2016 U.S. election to extend our understanding of affective political polarization and partisan media effects. We sought to make three contributions. First, we tested a tuning-in/catching-up hypothesis that those who consume the least partisan media in general will increase their partisan media consumption as an election approaches and, as a result, experience the largest effects of partisan media use. Second, we go beyond traditional measures of affective polarization to consider more normatively troubling unhealthy democratic attitudes. Finally, we consider the symbolic consequences of the threat of losing, then actually losing, the election on both polarization and unhealthy democratic attitudes. Results affirm a modest and generally unconditional polarizing effect of friendly media, a persistent and depolarizing effect of uncongenial media, and significant symbolic effects of the election on unhealthy democratic attitudes.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines both the antecedents and consequences of partisan misperceptions. Both cross-sectionally and over time, this study examines the relationships between both partisan media use and partisan beliefs on misperceptions. In addition, it examines the relationship between misperceptions and avoiding partisan media sources that could correct partisan misperceptions. The results suggest that partisan beliefs are more central to fostering misperceptions and subsequent media avoidance than partisan media use.\n","Abstract Body: Citizens’ misperceptions on critical issues such as climate change, migration or health are viewed as a major problem in today’s democratic systems. A large body of literature shows how misinformation and disinformation might lead to inaccurate beliefs which are difficult to correct. However, this study takes a different route by highlighting individuals’ motivated acts of resistance against factual journalistic reporting as an additional driver of misperceptions. Based on the frameworks of motivated reasoning and resistance strategies, we examine which processes enable individuals to arrive at political realities that differ from what they see in the news. Findings of the panel study in the Austrian election context (N = 523) suggest that news consumers form biased perceptions of the factual journalistic evidence which is presented in public broadcasting and quality newspapers. Moreover, individuals that engage in source derogation are able to uphold their misperceptions in the face of opposing evidence.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: misperceptions, resistance, panel study\n","Abstract Body: In the midst of heated debates surrounding the veracity and truthfulness of communication, scholarly attention has turned to the conceptualization of mis- and disinformation on the supply-side of (political) communication. Yet, we lack systematic research on the conceptualization of <i>perceived<\/i> mis- and disinformation. We conceptualize perceptions of mis- and disinformation as different dimensions of perceived untruthfulness that are substantially different from hostile media perceptions and media distrust. Original survey data collected in ten European countries (<i>N<\/i> = 6,643) confirms that perceived mis- and disinformation are different components of perceived untruthfulness. Our results point to an affinity between citizens’ populist attitudes and perceived mis- and disinformation, which confirms theoretical assumptions about the alignment between populism and post-truth politics. Together, our findings suggest that news consumers distinguish critical perspectives on the news media’s performance (misinformation) from distrust in the honesty of media elites (disinformation). This structure holds across different national settings. <br />\n","Abstract Body: People who report using partisan media outlets often hold inaccurate beliefs about politics. However, this link between partisan media use and political misperceptions has primarily been demonstrated in studies that rely on individuals' self-reported media use, or that examine the influence of a limited number of information outlets. The current study advances our understanding of the role of political media use in misinforming audiences by instead using a novel behavioral measure of partisan media exposure. Using a sample of American adults, we match data from individuals' internet browser histories with a survey measuring the accuracy of political beliefs to test the extent to which actual exposure to multiple partisan websites is associated with political misperceptions. We find that visits to partisan websites are related to acceptance of false political claims that are consistent with the political bias of the site. However, we also find that visiting partisan sites can improve belief accuracy about claims that are inconsistent with the outlets' bias. Interestingly, there is little evidence that visits to less partisan, centrist news sites lead to more accurate beliefs.\n","Abstract Body: Online incivility is one of the most studied topics in political communication recently. The growing body of research on the effects of online incivility on engagement, however, have yielded mixed findings. To answer whether online incivility has an effect on political engagement, we conducted a meta-analysis of 18 empirical studies (k=32) comprising of 10162 participants across three continents. Findings show that there was no significant relationship between online incivility and engagement (Zr= -0.0358, 95% CI = -0.227, 0.155). The null relationship can be explained by channel and type of online incivility as well as sample characteristics (e.g., age, gender, political leaning). Implications for future research are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: While researchers agree that incivility centers on disrespect and violation of interpersonal and political norms, there is growing acknowledgment that a range of incivility types exist and that different people consider different behaviors to be uncivil. The current paper examines the complexities in what <i>the public<\/i> perceives to be uncivil, whether what they perceive to be uncivil is consistent with previous research conducted in a different political timeframe, and whether individual characteristics and media use promote different perspectives on incivility. We replicate and extend the findings of a survey conducted in the United States in 2015 by examining whether similar categories of incivility (Personal-Level, Public-Level, Criminal, Immoral Incivility) continue to be top-of-mind for the public in 2018, and whether any new categories of incivility need to be highlighted for researchers. Additionally, we test whether a number of different characteristics predict the <i>type<\/i> of incivility that is top of mind for respondents. The findings of the survey suggest that the categories of incivility are relatively stable across time, the social media context for incivility was top of mind for respondents, and that individual-level characteristics and media use can affect individuals’ considerations about incivility.\n","Abstract Body: Incivility in political debates on blogs or social media platforms is a growing concern. While a large volume of research has examined the impact of political discussion and incivility, relatively little is known about the impact of online incivility on citizens’ attitude extremity and how the process is linked to citizens’ offline political talk. Drawing on deliberative theory and incivility literature, this study aims to address the gap in our understanding by analyzing a national panel data. Analysis of our moderated mediation model demonstrates that exposure to incivility through online media significantly increases citizens’ attitude extremity on controversial issues such as immigration, gun control, and abortion. More importantly, the findings show that the enduring effect of incivility is moderated by offline political talk such that the attitude bolstered after seeing uncivil online communication can become more moderate after having conversations about politics with family, friends, or unknown others in the real world.\n","Abstract Body: Research has identified contradictory effects of anger in political communication whereby anger engenders superficial and heuristic processing of information that exacerbates partisan bias in some situations but increases attention and deepens information processing in others. The current study addressed these apparent contradictions by positing hope as a moderator of anger’s effects on message processing and persuasion. Employing an experimental online survey in the context of the U.S. immigration debate with a nationally representative sample of adults (<i>N<\/i> = 567), the study assessed two long-standing mechanisms associated with the persuasive effects of anger—psychological reactance and message elaboration—and hope as a moderator of those processes. Results confirmed that anger increased reactance and superficial information processing. Critically, however, hope was revealed as a key moderator capable of reversing anger’s negative effects. These findings offer an important clarification of the boundary conditions governing the effects of anger and highlight the need for further study of interacting emotional processes in political communication.\n","Abstract Body: Research on the effectiveness of negative campaigning has so far failed to provide consensual results. Negative messages can depress evaluations of the target but are at the same time likely to backlash against the sponsor, with unclear “net” electoral outcomes. Much remains to be studied at the level of the message itself: which types of attacks are more likely to be effective, or to backlash? To the best of our knowledge, only little attention has been granted to a major component of contemporary political discourse: the use of humorous elements. Political humor is pervasive in the contemporary political culture and, yet, only scant evidence exists about its political effects. We contribute to this debate by triangulating evidence from three experimental studies on a sample of Dutch students in communication science (2018) and two samples of the US population (MTurk, 2018 and 2019). Our results show that combining political attacks with “other-deprecatory humor” (i.e., satirical jokes against the opponents) reduces the chances that the attacks backfire against their sponsor (backlash effect). At the same time, combining political attacks with other-deprecatory humor can increase effectiveness of the attacks in depressing evaluation of the target – if only for respondents that found the attacks funny. All in all, our results across the three studies suggest that political satire can act a “silver bullet” in reducing the harmful effects of political attacks for the sponsor while simultaneously making the attacks more effective to depress evaluations of the target.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Inconsistent opinions on the EU are widespread, at least in The Netherlands. Many voters favor EU support for the Dutch, while opposing Dutch support for EU measures. Inconsistent voters are not distributed evenly between pro-EU parties and Eurosceptic parties. Eurosceptic parties happen to be far more successful in mobilizing inconsistent voters than the lukewarm pro-EU parties. The emergence of climate change measures as a more important globalization issue than immigration did not diminish the percentage of inconsistent voters. In 2019 especially the Eurosceptic party FvD successfully mobilized inconsistent voters with its frame that, compared to the status quo, climate change measures are ineffective but come at high costs. The data come from an automated content analysis and panel survey data.\n","Abstract Body: At present, the EU policy of free movement appears to be increasingly politicized. However, our knowledge about how media impact these attitudes is limited. The purpose of the current study is therefore to test how key aspects of journalistic communication strategies affect attitudes toward free movement, and how different national conditions might influence media effects on attitudes toward free movement. The empirical findings from a survey experiment conducted in seven European countries suggest that news frames focusing on negative implications of free movement on the economy and labour market lead to more negative attitudes toward free movement than news frames focusing on positive implications, although the effect is not robust across countries. Furthermore, the results indicate that the effect of news coverage focusing on intra-EU immigration might be stronger in countries with higher unemployment rates.\n","Abstract Body: In the complex EU multilevel structure, citizens differ in their perceptions of who is responsible for policies and their outcomes. Policy responsibility consists of two concepts, functional and causal responsibility. While the latter has been studied in the context of \"\"blaming Europe\"\" for negative outcomes, the necessary condition of functional responsibility, i.e. the level of actual decision-making power, has received only scant attention. The media plays a crucial role in providing citizens with relevant information for attributing causal responsibility, but may be even more important for attributing functional responsibility. We test this for the case of the Netherlands using survey data including perceived levels of decision-making power between the European and national level for four policy areas: Immigration, social welfare, economy, and terrorism. The survey data is linked to an automated media content analysis of major Dutch newspapers and news websites. With regression models we predict the effect of exposure to policy-related information on the European level on policy-level attribution. Although the results show both differences in citizens' functional responsibility attributions and EU-related media coverage across policy areas, the findings show no direct effect from individual media consumption on responsibility attributions.\n","Abstract Body: Collecting data from China, Japan and South Korea, we examine factors predicting intentions to correct fake news in Asian collectivistic contexts. In collectivistic contexts, perceptual factors like perceived norms appear to be more powerful predictors of intentions to correct fake news than in the individualistic cultures, while third-person perceptions (the self-other perceived vulnerability gaps to fake news) serves as a weaker but still largely significant predictor. At the interpersonal level, conflict avoidance hinders individuals to correct others in China, but not in Japan or South Korea. In contrast, conflict avoidance positively associated with self-correction in Japan and South Korea, but not China. Drawing from Hofstede’s (2010) model about national cultures, we propose that these findings could be explained by the collectivism and uncertainty avoidance tendencies of Asian societies. Other implications are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Fact-checkers face a difficult task of disseminating their content and utilizing the condensed structure of social media to do so. Research has identified the delicate nature with which fact checks must be presented in order to ensure that individuals receive and remember the accurate information. This study utilizes Facebook Sponsored Posts and follow-up surveys for five international fact-checking organizations across 15 tests to analyze the effectiveness of three different types of fact check headlines: refutation, assertion, and question. Findings indicate that refutations to misinformation are more effective at increasing knowledge than assertion or question formats, although the question format promotes greater recall of seeing a post in one’s feed. These formats do not appear to amplify or diminish gaps in knowledge based on one’s attitudes about the topic. The differences, however, are small in magnitude. Practical implications for fact-checking organizations are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The rise of selective exposure, misinformation, and information control worldwide poses significant challenges to open communication in the political arena. Yet the question of how people respond to information control and how their responses affect authoritarianism remains not fully answered in the existing literature. Our study elucidates the consequences of information control from an audience perspective. Using a randomized experiment in China, we find that experiencing censorship largely boosts people’s interest and motivates them to search for information through alternative channels. Censored messages, once identified, are more likely to be circulated and discussed. However, reactance in one’s private realm comes alongside self-censorship in the public space. One tends to self-censor in the recognition of state authority while decreasing their evaluations of governments privately. Our study suggests that psychological reactance in response to information deprivation occurs and resolves at the individual level, which in turn, coupling with the awareness of state capacity, reduces the possibility of collective actions and stabilizes authoritarian rules in short term. Yet it can lead to a boomerang effect that is detrimental to the government in the long run.\n","Abstract Body: This study compares what and how the Chinese social media censors censor the public opinion leaders on Sina Weibo. Existing studies show that information censorship in China is selective by topics, types of media outlets and regions. However, few studies have investigated whether it is also the case with online social groups of different ideologies, i.e. rightists and leftists. What is evening more interesting is what content generated by the rightists and the leftists is censored and what censorship methods are employed on the two groups respectively. To answer these questions, we have observed censorship practices on Sina Weibo for a whole month and collected and analyzed the censored social media posts of both the rightists and the leftists. Our analysis confirmed the existence of selective censorship on posts by the two groups of public opinion leaders.\n","Abstract Body: While the world is celebrating the democratic potential of social media to give normal people voice, a widespread phenomenon of self-censorship on social media has not yet been adequately studied. Building upon previous literature, this paper proposed a two-aspect definition of self-censorship including both mental and behavioral aspects. With the definition, this paper empirically examined the direct and indirect influence of network-, governmental-, and platform-related factors on the willingness and behavior of self-censorship based on a national representative survey of 2,017 U.S. adult. The results show that social network heterogeneity, lower perceived government surveillance, or higher platform privacy concern will significantly lead to the higher willingness of self-censor, which then negatively predicts political expression on social media. The current study contributes to the scholarship of political communication by revealing self-censorship’s role as a bridging factor between social media use and political expression and by providing guidance for individual citizens, government bodies, and social media platform to better ensure free political expression, which is a vital foundation to deliberative democracy.\n","Abstract Body: Edward Snowden's June 2013 revelations about the U.S. government's digital surveillance program created significant debate about the potential risks and benefits of government surveillance. Some view the government's digital surveillance as creaking risks such as eroding citizens' fundamental rights and negatively affecting the society's democratic ideals. Others view it as providing benefits such as safety of the digital communications medium and providing citizens with peace of mind in conducting their social and economic activities digitally. Both views have implications for citizens' digital technology usage behaviors. We build on the routine activity theory to view the government as a capable guardian of the digital communications medium against malicious activities such as terrorism and crime. We hypothesize that the government's digital surveillance increases the citizens’ frequency of digital technology usage by increasing the safety of the digital communications medium. On the other hand, the government's surveillance of private communications could decrease the citizens' willing to sensitive content digitally. We build on the chilling effects theory to hypothesize that government's digital surveillance creates chilling effects and engenders citizens to self-censor sensitive topics and keywords in online searches and self-restrict how they use digital technologies. We find support for these hypotheses in a dataset collected from a nationally representative panel of 607 U.S citizens in the aftermath of Snowden's 2013 revelations. The proposed theory and the findings have important implications for information science research and practice.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br />The media is a central arena for actors challenging government practice, and those who succeed in publicly defining issues in the media can influence resource distribution and policy outcomes. Departing from the large number of citizens participating in mainstream health media coverage, the present study explores which actors influence the media framing of a contentious issue, before and after a policy change. By means of a mixed methods study of the media coverage on priority setting of health care in Norway, it analyses the relation between actor frames and the dominant media frames. While confirming that actors vary in their ability to influence the media, the findings contend traditional conceptions that representation equates media influence, and sheds light on how framing power is hierarchical and interactive.<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Terrorist organizations create dramatic events to attract news coverage that instills feelings of threat, panic, or moral indignation in a target population. Despite strong academic interest in the strategies and effects of terrorist activity, how these terror events are communicated to target populations remains less well understood. It is especially unclear whether news coverage of terrorist events tends to be presented in ways that might stimulate fear responses, or whether news coverage might instead cue anger or ingroup solidarity as a response to violations of social norms by outgroups. This paper draws on the lived history of over 190,000 terrorist attacks around the world to assess how discourses about terrorism events have evolved in <i>New York Times<\/i> reporting from 1945 to 2018. We leverage known features of terrorist attacks as a natural experiment to examine whether strategically important features of <i>Times-<\/i>produced news discourse respond to terrorist activities in ways that align with the strategic aims of terrorist organizations. While <i>Times<\/i> reporting on terrorist events has evolved since World War Two in ways that have strategic importance for terrorist groups, we find that the number, lethality, and novelty of terrorist attacks have little consistent or substantive impact on weekly variation in news discourses about terror events.\n","Abstract Body: The paper analyzes media frames of the Senate confirmation hearings of Brett Kavanaugh and of the role that Twitter played in magnifying their prominence as well as introducing supporting or opposing frames. Our analysis shows expected balanced mainstream media coverage together with polarized framing on ideological cable. The influence of the MeToo movement waned over time, overtaken by a sustained and disciplined campaign by conservative defenders. This was especially evident in Twitter, which largely replicated frames disseminated by traditional media, but also propagated frames disseminated by partisan websites and conspiracy theorists. By comparison, the MeToo movement did not match the centrality of conservative hubs that dominated Twitter framing. The analysis replicates research showing the disciplined coherence and purity of conservative discourse and successful reframing of a political controversy into a legal one.\n","Abstract Body: The relationship between news media and political actors is often depicted as an intimate dance. The political agenda-setting is one classical approach which has been used to help understand this power relationship. Following this strand of research, this study examines the dynamic relationship between media and government agendas in post-handover Hong Kong. The findings reveal the reciprocal and contingent nature of such interactions. Specifically, government agenda leads media agendas for political issues, and it follows media agendas for non-political issues. Most interactions were observed between pro-establishment newspaper and government agenda, while least interactions exist between pro-democracy newspaper and government agenda. Overall, these findings shed light on the power contestation of post-handover Hong Kong politics.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This pair of experiments (<i>N <\/i>= 240) set out to explain and predict how people make decisions in low-information political environments. Guided by feelings-as-information theory (Schwarz, 2011) we found that language difficulty within low-salience direct democracy ballots influenced people’s affective experience while processing this information, and that participants used their affective experience to guide vote choice. Specifically, easier texts were more likely to be supported, and difficult texts were more likely to be opposed or abstained from voting on. Additionally, given our use of real ballot initiatives, we were able to corroborate our lab results with the outcomes of real-world elections to demonstrate the ecological validity of the theoretical propositions we test. Taken together, this work offers communicative and psychological insight into how language affects information processing, and how these processing experiences inform decisions of consequence to everyday life.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Smartphone ownership has become incredibly prevalent. As a result, a wealth of information is now accessible to people at their fingertips via web searches. One important but understudied domain where this vast information resource may be useful to individuals is at the voting booth. In this study, we examined the extent to which individuals use their smartphones in making voting decisions, and how this information can facilitate making sound voting decisions. First, we report the results of a survey that asked a nationally representative group of people in the United States about their use of smartphones in the voting booth. Then, we report initial results of a pre-registered (https://osf.io/fngsv/?view_only=6f3ece2c56104fc8a821accc201978f5) experimental study where we investigated whether the use of technology during voting produced more sound voting decisions. We found that, regardless of using a smartphone or conventional device (i.e. laptop computer), the ability to engage in an information search while voting led to a significantly greater proportion of sound voting decisions than chance. We situate these findings in the context of understanding voter decision-making in the contemporary media environment.\n","Abstract Body: The influence of partisan identification infiltrates all aspects of a democracy. The current study employs an innovative experimental design to explore the presidential debate viewing experience. Data was collected from across the country for all three 2016 presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and a social identity theoretical perspective is utilized to better understand the process through which viewers form political attitudes. Applying the theory of identity-motivated elaboration to a new form of political communication (i.e., debates), the current research illuminates how partisan social identification can change the way viewers think about political issues and, resultingly, evaluate candidates and form political opinions.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates to what extent political campaigns differentiate their strategic messaging across social media platforms. In order to uncover whether campaign messages converge or diverge across platforms, we compare the public Facebook and Twitter posts issued by the Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump campaigns during the 2016 US general election (September 1 - November 9, 2016). Methodologically, we combine an array of computational methods (fuzzy string matching, automated content analysis, and supervised machine learning) with a qualitative reading of the campaigns’ messages to categorize and compare cross-platform versus platform-specific content.<br /><br />Overall, we find a substantial degree of content overlap between the two campaigns’ Facebook and Twitter posts. Approximately one quarter of the Trump campaign’s messages were largely identical across the two platforms, and 60% of Clinton’s Facebook messages were also present on Twitter. We do, however, find key strategic differences relating to how this content was conveyed to electorate. Our machine learning algorithm categorized posts by topic issues and message type, and we found the latter to be a significant predictor of platform differentiation. That is, candidates promoted the same policy issues across platforms, but their messages differed across platforms at the level of message strategy. Most notably, the Clinton campaign messaged Hispanic audiences in Spanish solely on Facebook. The Trump campaign promoted livestreams predominantly on Facebook, while reserving Twitter for broadcasting information relating to mass media interviews. The findings point to the need for differentiating policy issues from campaigns’ strategic messaging in the study of social media campaigning.\n","Abstract Body: It is assumed that a valuable political brand directly translates into the ability of a party to gain and sustain electoral votes. However, very little empirical research has been done to investigate whether that is true. This study is the first to explore the relationship between brand strength and, specifically, the strength of specific brand components (authenticity and authority) and electoral success within the unique context of a political environment. Content analysis of news coverage and political campaign materials suggests that there may indeed be a relationship between brand strength and electoral success. This research adds to the existing body of knowledge on factors that may influence electoral success. It should serve as a starting point for further clarifying the definitional components of political brands as well as the process of quantifying them in order to concretely determine how much of an effect branding has in political environments.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper describes the development of the digital political advertising network from 2003 to 2016. Taking theoretical guidance from the social institution level of the hierarchy of influences model, digital advertising providers are connected by their shared clients: campaigns and political committees. Over the last four election cycles, the network has grown quickly but diffusely, structurally defined by a single dominant component with dozens of small and isolated components. Five digital political advertising agencies eventually become the most central players in 2016, but only if platforms are excluded from the analysis. This network analysis empirically demonstrates platform companies’ centrality and theoretical consequence to the industry of paid digital political communication through a comparison of network-level structure and nodal-level centrality measures when major platforms are included and excluded from analyses. The dual function of platforms in this network—as both distributors of content as well as potentially active consultants—make them unique from other players. While major platforms are likely receptive to the norms, practices, and ethics from within the network, they also have<br />exceptional power to impact the field’s norms, practices, and ethics in a way that actors whom campaigns and committees are not as dependent on simply do not.\n","Abstract Body: In their mission to influence public policy outcomes, advocacy groups may combine the pursuit of direct interactions with policymakers (‘inside lobbying’) with the mobilization of public opinion via news media and public actions (‘outside lobbying’) in complementary ways. This paper expands existing scholarship on the calibration of public interest groups’ advocacy strategies by testing the determinants of outside lobbying among a globally comparative sample of electoral reform groups. It draws on an organizational survey of 292 NGOs in 62 countries to demonstrate that election monitors – much like other human rights advocates – need to strike a balance between their imperatives of organizational maintenance, their country’s legal and political opportunity structures, and their strategic alignment with opposition parties and transnational advocacy networks. In concert, these factors explain why election reformers predominantly follow a logic of ‘outside lobbying’, and why their success and failure hinges crucially on garnering public attention. By bringing in previously ignored macro-institutional factors such as media freedom and electoral integrity, this contributes to scholarship on groups’ media strategies beyond established democracies. It also adds to research into electoral authoritarianism, which has thus far neglected the importance of the advocacy-media interface in examining impacts of election monitors.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Populist ideology and populist communication have become prevalent globally in recent years. It is commonly believed that populist communication is highly persuasive because of the emotion-eliciting appeals. However, few studies have examined the process of how populist communication influences emotional reactions and persuasion. This study proposes a typology of populist communication strategies combining insights from framing, attempts to test the different discrete emotions elicited by different populist strategies, and examines their effects on persuasiveness. A 2 (threat vs. assurance) by 2 (advocacy vs. blame) between-subjects experiment (N = 290) was conducted in this study. The findings confirm the previous studies which suggest that populist communication is inherently emotional, corroborates the current line of research on the persuasive effects of news frames through emotions.\n","Abstract Body: This paper introduces the concept of political affective forecasting as the social process of predicting one’s own and others’ feelings in relation to future political events, such as elections, referenda, wars, and crises. Based on a synthesis of the psychological literature on affective forecasting and political communication scholarship, we develop an analytical framework for studying political affective forecasts. We suggest that in the political realm, affective forecasting needs to be investigated by taking into account the complex social interactions and the wider media environment in which these projections take place. Drawing on rich empirical evidence from the case study of the (two) Israeli 2019 elections (panel survey and focus groups), we demonstrate the role of social identities and media exposure in shaping these forecasts, and show the mobilizing power of predicted emotions. Finally, we set a methodological and empirical agenda for future research on affective forecasting in communication studies.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Examining news coverage of Ksenia Sobchak's 2018 Presidential election campaign. The content analysis will include an examination of five popular Russian news sources. The aim of the study is to expand research on gender and politics beyond the dominant focus of the United States and Western Europe and examine gender dynamics in Russia.\n","Abstract Body: This paper investigates whether pan-European lead candidates are able to mobilize European voters. It focusses on the two 2019 nominees for the European Greens, who were Dutch and German, respectively. We collected experimental data from The Netherlands and Germany in early April 2019. We test the effects of (non-)personalized campaign messages on a) turnout intention and b) vote intention for the Greens and test possible mediating effects of campaign and candidate evaluations. We designed fictional campaign posters to which respondents were randomly exposed. The stimulus material varied according to four conditions: 1) The national lead candidate, 2) the other European lead candidate, 3) another Green candidate from the respective country, and 4) the party. Our results suggest that while personalized campaigns versus non-personalized campaigns may not matter per se, individual candidates can make a difference in European elections. As such, they have important implications for understanding European election campaigns.\n",null,"Abstract Body: female candidates run the risk of undercutting their candidacies if they evoke feminine stereotypes (Bauer 2015) but they could also run the risk of facing a backlash if they evoke too many masculine qualities (Krupnikov and Bauer 2014, Vraga 2017). Female candidates often engage in a delicate strategic stereotype balance to manage these challenges among voters (Fridkin and Kenney 2015, Carpinella and Bauer 2019). Much of the current research investigates how voters respond to the way female candidates manage stereotype challenges through personality trait or issue messages (see e.g. Bauer 2018a, 2019, Dolan 2014) or through campaign behaviors of candidates such as displays of emotionality or personalization through social media (Brooks 2013, Meeks 2016). This project builds on the existing scholarship to test how female incumbents fare when they campaign on messages that highlight their high levels of productivity. I test how voters respond to strategic messages that credit-claim (Mayhew 1974) and how voters respond to messages that highlight the role of compromise and consensus building in the legislative process. Using three survey experiments, I find that voters do not necessarily punish female candidates for using credit-claiming messages, which violate the behavioral expectations for women more generally, but voters reward both female and male lawmakers who engage in credit-sharing, though credit-sharing can, sometimes, <!--![endif]---->\n",null,"Abstract Body: News framing can exert a strong influence on public opinion and policy support. Using an online experiment, this study investigates the impact of exposure to valenced news frames on public support for Syrian refugee admissions. Findings show that participants exposed to benefit (positive) frame news story expressed more behavioral intentions to support Syrian refugees and considered the impact of refugee admissions more positively than participants exposed to threat (negative) and victim (neutral) frames. The study also reveals anti-immigrant sentiment moderates framing effects. Participants with low levels of anti-immigrant sentiment are more susceptible to framing effects. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: As conflicts flare around the world, images of refugees are a familiar presence in Western media. We explore how visual refugee depictions affect public opinion, using three survey experimental studies with 25 images and over 4,500 respondents in Sweden, US, and UK. Consistent with previous Moral Foundations Theory research, we find that ideology moderates the impact of visuals on emotional responses, with conservatives more likely to report both compassion and condemnation of refugees when exposed to photographic images of people in need, while liberals report primarily compassion. Conservatives, though far less compassionate towards refugees than liberals, are more responsive to the type of refugee depicted, particularly to children in distress, whereas liberals are largely unmoved by variations in visual depictions. The studies find that the pathway through which depictions of refugees impact conservatives’ support for humanitarian aid is mediated by the moral emotions evoked by exposure to the images.\n","Abstract Body: The overall aim of this study was to investigate the causal direction of the relationship between incidental news exposure via social media and political participation. Incidental news exposure—defined as encounters with political news and information by chance, rather than by volition—has become an increasingly prevalent avenue for political news consumption, and recent studies have found that incidental exposure is positively related to political participation. Yet, these studies mostly rely on cross-sectional data to examine this relationship, which at best provides inferences about correlation rather than causation. Against this background, the present study rigorously compares alternative model specifications between a “mobilization model” (incidental news exposure stimulates political participation) and a “reinforcement model” (participation increases the likelihood of being incidentally exposed to news), using panel data. Our findings offer new insights beyond those that have emerged from previous studies based on cross-sectional data. While we did find a significant mobilizing effect of incidental news exposure, we also found that the participation-to-incidental exposure path is notably stronger than the reverse path, thus lending unique new support for reinforcement models of participation and social media use.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Previous research has shown that people can be incidentally exposed to news on social media. However, this research is based on data from a small pool of countries. In this paper, we use online survey data from 36 markets to investigate incidental exposure to news on three separate social networks: Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. In line with previous studies, we find that those who use Facebook, Twitter or YouTube (but do not intentionally use them for news) still consume news from significantly more news sources than those who do not use these networks at all. We argue that these findings highlight the importance of distinguishing between incidental exposure on different social networks, of paying attention to cross-country variation, and that studying the influence of incidental exposure on news repertoires will help with the interpretation of findings linking incidental exposure to media effects.\n","Abstract Body: Access to news and political information is not distributed equally among citizens, but depends on their individual resources and motivations. A rise in the availability of news content on social media over the past decade has been accompanied by a hope that people with lower socioeconomic status and less interest in political affairs would be “accidently” exposed to news. By combining tracking and survey data from a Dutch online panel sample (n=413) we test whether the pathway to news via social media is a leveler of news inequalities or if the specificities of social media ecosystems rather accelerate the news gap. We employed click sequence analysis and measured the amount of news content on the Facebook newsfeed to analyze how political interest, income, and education influence news exposure and news consumption. We find that a higher level of political interest is associated with a higher amount of news exposure on Facebook and a higher amount of news items consumed via social media sites but not with a higher amount of news consumption via news websites. When a news item was accessed via a social media, users engaged less often in news-related follow-up behavior than after consuming news item referred via news website. Overall, our results indicate that social media news use seems to occur particularly for those who are already interested in current affairs and makes follow-up consumption less likely.<br />Access to news and political information is not distributed equally among citizens, but depends on their individual resources and motivations.

Much of that research employs self-reported measures obtained with surveys, known to suffer from accuracy problems. We offer new insights on the nature of those problems when measuring exposure to online news sources. We show that self-reported measures of digital news consumption have four types of bias. There is bias in the selection of sources (only a small fraction are analyzed); the audience size of those sources (greatly underestimated); the relative salience of news sites (e.g., visibility rank position); and the identification of longitudinal changes (they are mischaracterized). Our analyses quantify the magnitude of these biases, offering unprecedented comparative evidence on online news consumption that spans nine countries and a period of five years. We discuss the implications of our findings for future research on news exposure.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Long before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, politics of resentment shaped a political environment in the United States characterized by perceived distributive injustice, detachment between politicians and the people, and strong political polarization with ignorance for the other side, feeding into what is now called populism. However, politics of resentment and perceived procedural and distributive injustice on the one hand, and a desire for political knowledge and the willingness to connect with the other side on the other hand, have not been used to predict selective exposure and avoidance of specific populist message features including <i>people-centrism<\/i>, <i>anti-elitism<\/i>, <i>restoring<\/i> <i>popular sovereignty<\/i>, and the <i>exclusion of others<\/i>. The present study simultaneously models selective exposure to and avoidance of populist news as two separate functions within the same statistical model thereby addressing typical pitfalls of selective exposure data. Using a non-student U.S. sample (<i>N <\/i>= 440), recruited in the direct aftermath of the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, we recorded and modeled digital trace data for the use of manipulated news website. The study shows that especially the will to connect with others explained exposure to news about <i>anti-elitism, <\/i>about <i>restoring sovereignty<\/i>, and the <i>exclusion of others<\/i>, especially among Democrats, while Republicans’ news avoidance seems to be specifically geared towards certain news features (<i>anti-elitism<\/i>, <i>people-centrism<\/i>), providing the <i>anti-elitism <\/i>news feature possibly with bipartisan (re-)connecting powers across the aisle.\n","Abstract Body: Linkage analysis, i.e. the combination of news media content data and self-report survey data has been regarded as a gold standard for (news) media effects. In this paper, we show that this empirical design faces serious challenges when applying it to news media effects in a digital age. The challenges include (1) imprecise measures of (online) news exposure in traditional surveys (2) the end of mass media as most important source of information, (3) personalization of media content, as well as (4) measurement short-term dynamic processes. Introducing Mobile Intensive Longitudinal Linkage Analysis (MILLA), we show how to face these challenges by using an innovative combination of Smartphone-Data donations to capture media exposure and relevant media content, a mobile experience sampling questionnaire to capture immediate reactions to news, and the content analysis of uploaded news media content to measure media effects. The design is explained by using an example of negativity in the news and effects on emotional reactions of recipients.\n","Abstract Body: Citizens’ interest in and their information about political life are key ingredients of healthy democratic life which have increasingly been studied from a personality perspective. While we know how broad personality traits affect citizens’ levels of general political interest and consumption of political information, the consequences of specific cognitive-motivational dispositions on these political engagement outcomes are less well understood.<br /><br />This preregistered study tests the information-behavior outcomes of a key information-related individual disposition, the need for cognitive closure (NFCC). NFCC(Kruglanski, 1990)NFCC is a multidimensional construct that reflects individuals’ (Roets et al., 2015).<br />This study focuses on the impact of NFCC on <i>political interest<\/i> and <i>news consumption <\/i>. As a relatively stable disposition to engage with new information about political issues (Prior, 2010), political interest can reflect a more general motivation to update political worldviews, attitudes, and opinions. In this view, <i>lack<\/i> of interest would facilitate cognitive closure so long as such worldviews, attitudes, and opinions are preexisting in a person’s mind.<br /><br />By extension, if political interest is an intrinsic motivation to engage with information concerning one’s political environment, it should lead to acts of information seeking such as consumption of political news media (e.g., Eveland, Hayes, Shah, & Kwak, 2005), with the magnitude and direction of the relation varying across types of medium (Boulianne, 2011).<br /><br />In this preregistered study, we directly address a puzzle uncovered in pilot studies, which indicated that while NFCC appears to generally have a negative effect on citizens’ general interest in politics, impacting their news consumption, it <i>increased <\/i>political interest and news consumption in a U.S. sample during the tumultuous 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign. Exploiting multi-year survey panel data from 2014-2018, covering the “2015 European Refugee Crisis,” we will test the prediction that while people high in NFCC will show less interest in politics during politically routine periods, they will show greater interest in moments of perceived political crisis. As Prior (2010) concluded through dynamic panel models of longitudinal data conducted in four countries over four decades, political interest may be stable, but it fluctuates in the short term after profound political and personal events.<br /><br />Data for this study were made available by GESIS on 23 October 2019, and presentation at the 2020 ICA conference will cover the entire set of analyses preregistered on OSF.<br /><br />Hypotheses<br />H1a: The association between NFCC and general political interest will be negative or nonexistent in politically routine periods (panel waves 1, 4, and 5).<br />H1b: The association between NFCC and the frequency of political news consumption will be negative or nonexistent in politically routine periods (panel waves 1, 4, and 5). H2a: The association between NFCC and general political interest will be positive or less negative in political crisis periods (panel waves 2 and 3).<br />H2b: The association between NFCC and the frequency of political news consumption will be positive or less negative in political crisis periods (panel waves 2 and 3).<br />H3: The association between NFCC and the frequency of political news consumption will be partly mediated by general political interest (all panel waves).<br /><br />Methods<br /><br />Study design<br />The study will use a panel survey design and draw on data from six waves of the GESIS Panel, a probability-based omnibus access panel representative of the German-speaking adult population, with five annual waves fielded in April 2014-2018 (Waves 1-5), and one additional wave measuring dispositional NFCC in December 2018 (Wave 6). The GESIS Panel is a self-administered online and paper-and-pencil surveys administered bimonthly, which provides data on the focal outcomes of this study (general political interest and frequency of political news consumption; Waves 1-5); data for the focal factor (need for cognitive closure; Wave 6); and data for controls (age, gender, and Big Five personality traits) from the wave closest to Waves 1-5, respectively.<br /><br />Sample size<br />Based on the GESIS Panel data available at the time of preregistration, the active sample size was N = 4,450 with a unit nonresponse of 9.4% (421 panelists). We therefore expected a sample size of N ≈ 4,000 for this study, which will rely on data from Wave ff for all registered analyses (Wave 6 in this study; field period running from mid-December 2018 to mid-February 2019).<br />Outcome measures<br /><br /><i>General political interest<\/i>, measured in Waves 1-5, is measured with a single item, “How interested are you in politics?” with responses falling on a five-point scale (1 = Very strongly, 2 = Strongly, 3 = Moderately, 4 = Little, 5 = Not at all).<br /><i>Frequency of political news consumption, <\/i>measured in Waves 1-5, is tapped by the item, \"\"How often do you generally follow news about political events in Germany and the world?\"\" Response options fell on a seven-point scale (1 = More than two hours per day, 2 = One to two hours per day, 3 = Less than one an hour per day, 4 = More than once a week, 5 = Once a week, 6 = Once a month or less, 7 = Never).<br /><br />Focal predictor<br /><i>Need for cognitive closure<\/i> (NFCC) is measured through the validated five-item NFCC short scale (Author, 2014). Each of the five items taps into one of the five dimensions of NFCC, and asked respondents to indicate the degree to which the item applied to them (1 = Not at all, 2= Rather not, 3 = Partly, 4 = Rather, 5 = Fully): (1) I enjoy having a clear and structured mode of life; (2) I dislike unpredictable situations; (3) I don’t like situations that are uncertain; (4) I dislike questions which could be answered in many different ways; (5) I would quickly become impatient and irritated if I would not find a solution to a problem immediately.<br /><br />Covariates<br />Covariates for this study include the <i>Big Five personality traits,<\/i> <i>need for cognition<\/i> (NFC), <i>age<\/i>, and <i>gender<\/i>. Detailed information on all measures included in the GESIS Panel can be found in the GESIS Panel Documentation (GESIS, 2018).<br />Pre-Analysis Plan<br />This study will use structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the stated hypotheses. The structural model component of the tested models (shown in Figure 1 using standard SEM notation), will be estimated once for each wave from which data on the focal outcomes are available (Waves 1-5). Estimation will be done using maximum likelihood (ML) or, if the data exhibit considerable missingness, ML under MAR (missing at random). Data on the focal predictor, NFCC, will come from a single, subsequent wave (Wave 6). NFCC will be assumed invariant across Waves 1-6, since as a dispositional individual difference NFCC is theoretically expected (e.g., Soto et al., 2011) and has empirically exhibited only slow intraindividual upward change over the adult lifespan (Cornelis et al., 2009). Data included in this panel study span only six years from Waves 1-6; intraindividual change in dispositional NFCC is expected to be minimal in the observed adult population over this time span.<br /><br />We will estimate confidence intervals for the parameter estimates of interest (path coefficients) in each wave and identify changes across waves by comparing CIs for the same path coefficients across waves. Cases where the CIs for the same path do not overlap across waves will be interpreted as providing evidence of change in statistical association of variables over time. The preregistration materials include further information on measurement model specifications as well as data exclusion rules and the handling of missing data.<br /><br />References<br />Boulianne, S.

While empirical research focuses on whether and which positions individuals take in a political debate, the effort invested into opinion formation (process quality) and argumentative grounding of opinions (outcome quality) are at the center of normative conceptions. This study provides a conceptual definition of “depth of opinion formation” that is much closer to the normative conception of “high-quality” opinion formation. It suggests an operational definition and measurement instruments (18 items) with high face validity; it tests the instruments‘ internal consistency, factor structure, divergent, and convergent validity. It suggests that opinion formation can be conceived as an overarching top-level construct that encompasses information behavior (information avoidance [negative], information seeking), self-perceived state of opinion formation (self-perceived knowledge grounding, self-perceived opinion grounding), and motivation for opinion formation (general interest in the issue, interest in current events).\n","Abstract Body: There is little doubt over the existence of affective polarization, but findings on the related causal effects of party cues on non-political behavior may be affected by design decisions related to the volume and types of information used in experiments, as well as the trust framework employed. Here, we consider how these effects vary across low and high information environments for context similar to initial trust conditions.<br />We found that in low trust conditions, the effects of party cues are stable between party groups and are strong relative to the effects of other pieces of information about race, gender, religion, religiosity, policy preferences, and cultural preferences. However, such effects are reduced and become highly moderated by party affiliation within the high information environment. These findings suggest that differences between the implications of earlier research on the behavioral consequences of affective polarization and daily life may be explained by assumptions made in the design of earlier studies.\n","Abstract Body: By providing disproportionate attention to populist politicians, the journalistic media have arguably fueled their success. We construct and empirically test a theoretical framework, which proposes that political satire—by the use of humor, focus on internal contradictions, and criticism without being bound to journalistic principles of objectivity and facticity—may be the best antidote to populism’s success. Using a representative panel survey that functions as natural experiment in the Netherlands, we show that exposure to a popular satire show can indeed lower support for a right-wing populist party, its leader, and the perceived capability of this party. Specifically, the findings show how satirically revealing the “weak spot” of populism (i.e. lacking concrete treatment recommendations) lowers populist support; particularly among citizens who inclined to vote for populist parties. These findings have important democratic implications as they reveal that satire can have a real-life impact on the political decisions that voters make.\n","Abstract Body: This research explores the influence of social media on the Mexican National Election of 2018. Through the creation of the measurement <i>Agreement Ratio<\/i> and the content analysis of about 2,500 Facebook users’ replies to both political parties’ posts and users’ comments (2 layers of analysis), this study unveiled that an echo chamber environment was fostered by both conservative and liberal parties, validating the <i>uncertainty-identity theory <\/i>(Hogg, 2014). Four political parties were analyzed—where all of them also demonstrated a one-way communication strategy— resulting on a digital radiography of a polarized society, where a national democratic dialogue (Barbera, Jost, Nagler, Tucker, & Bonneau, 2015) is desired but non-existing.\n","Abstract Body: Democratic disconnect has become a shared concern in the academic community across established Western liberal democracies. Previous studies, mostly from political scientists, explored structural deficiencies of the representative political system that impact citizens’ political involvement in democratic politics. Using national representative samples from the United States and Germany, this study takes a cross-national comparative perspective to examine communicative factors of social trust and media use in predicting non-institutional and contentious forms of political participation in the context of conventional institutional political participation being disrupted. The findings suggest that political trust is a significant negative predictor of non-institutional political participation in Germany; and informational use of the Internet is a strong positive predictor of non-institutional political participation in both countries. Implications are discussed.<br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> democratic disconnect, media use, social trust, non-institutional political participation\n","Abstract Body: This study attempts to describe and explain the phenomenon of citizen contacting within the Chinese context. The study first presents a social profile of contactors and then examined the purported role of seven key variables which were identified in the literature in affecting the likelihood of citizen contacting. Consistent with the literature, perceived need for government assistance is proved to be the primary driving force of citizen contacting. Socioeconomic status (SES) model is found to be inconsistent and rather weak in explaining citizen contacting. Other influential factors include awareness of government services, political efficacy, and the amount of social ties. These factors are inconsistently present in different explanatory models. Implications and limitations of this study are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: The present study seeks to examine the trends of influence of broadcast media exposure, political ideology, and voter affect on political participation during presidential elections in the United States. Using secondary data from American National Election Studies (ANES) surveys from 1984 to 2012, we found different patterns of media influence over voters’ negative affect towards Democratic versus Republican candidates, and subsequently voters’ political mobilization and voting preferences.\n","Abstract Body: Studied here are the differential effects of juvenalian and horatian satire viewing on political participation. Using data from an online survey, we theorize the O-S-R-O-R framework in which individual-level variables (i.e., partisanship, traditional news use) are associated with political satire viewing, and political satire viewing is associated with potential mediators – political talk, social media expression, political knowledge, and efficacy – to predict online and offline political participation. In general, juvenalian satire has greater direct impact on both online and offline participation, while horatian satire has a direct negative impact on online participation. In addition, partisanship guides political satire viewing, such that Democrats are more likely to watch juvenalian satire, whereas Republicans are more likely to avoid it. Traditional news use appears to be an essential prerequisite for the participatory effects of political satire. These findings suggest that satirical tone and audience factor matter in the study of political satire.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Although misinformation is not new, the term “fake news” has recently entered public discourse and scholarly research, distinct from the former in that it aims to delegitimize real news and is globally weaponized by political leaders and partisan media to achieve such a goal. The present study aims to assess the extent to which the “fake news” label affects trust in news articles, journalists, and news organizations through two different experiments. Results indicate that the fake news label is distinct from other labels for false content and that it has distinct effects for trust in a news organization and its journalists. These findings provide actionable insights for news organizations seeking to distance themselves from the term while still providing their audiences with accurate information.\n","Abstract Body: European political actors have been heavily affected by the so-called disinformation crisis, leading to intense worries about how EU citizens may be guaranteed access to trustworthy information in years to come. While there is increasing political research on how EU officials, platforms, and political parties react to the threat of disinformation, less attention has been paid to another crucial group of actors in Brussels: EU correspondents. This paper presents one of the first empirical observations of EU correspondents’ perceptions of the disinformation, conducted during a pressurized 2019 EP Election Campaign. We conduct a survey with journalists stemming from media across Europe, and ask: What are the (a) perceived concerns and (b) perceived competences EU correspondents have in dealing with fake news?  Our data provides important first insights that may transform our understanding of how journalists adapt to digitalised democracies.\n","Abstract Body: <br />In high-choice media environments where traditional news media face fiercer competition than ever from a host of partisan and alternative media, and where their legitimacy is more challenged than ever by not only partisan and alternative media but also political actors, the issue of media trust and the extent to which it matters for people’s news media use has taken on new importance. At the same time, the extent to which (a) people trust the news media and (b) how much it matters for their use of these and other types of media is not clear. Part of the problem is that research on media trust suffers from a lack of common conceptualizations and operationalizations, while another part is insufficient research addressing the relationship  between media trust and media use. Against this background, this paper seeks to (a) review how news media trust has been conceptualized and operationalized in previous research, (b) review research on the extent to which news media trust influences the use of traditional news media versus non-mainstream, alternative or partisan media, and (c) suggest a theoretically derived framework for research on news media trust and its influence on selective exposure.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The spread of digital misinformation has raised concerns among researchers, journalists, and political actors. Scholarly works in that area often bring up the troubling possibility that fake news would cause lasting damage to an already fraying public trust in democratic institutions. This study offers one of the first research efforts to date examining the link between fake news exposure and changing institutional trust. In order to measure robustly both information consumption and political attitudes, we combine records of online behavior with longitudinal survey data.<br />Our results confirm that exposure to fake news is linked to decreasing confidence in mass media. Consuming fabricated content that mimics the format of mainstream news is likely to make people question the quality of legitimate journalism. In contrast, we find that fake news exposure has a more complicated relationship with people’s confidence in political institutions. For strong liberals, consuming fabricated content is linked to lower political trust. The opposite is true for moderates and conservatives, for whom fake news exposure predicts higher trust in political institutions. Those findings confirm that the consequences of fake news cannot be studied in isolation. In order to effectively anticipate the implications of misinformation spread, research needs to consider the current media and political environment.<br />\n","Abstract Body: In recent times, Western Democracies have experienced intense debates and struggles over political values. The 2016 U.S. Presidential election was not the exception and was structured by the discourses of two candidates who presented significant differences over their axiological understanding of the world. One way for unpacking these axiological battles is by researching the narratives that structure political campaigns. Accordingly, this research presents the results of textual and narrative analyses of the messages that Clinton and her team built for outreaching Latino communities during the 2016 presidential elections. The Spanish language messages produced by the Democratic campaign compose the sample, which includes 46 multimedia blog posts, 248 multimedia Facebook posts, 692 multimedia tweets, and 19 television ads. This study offers two main conclusions. 1) An important part of Clinton’s Latino outreach was devoted to counterattack Trump’s ideas against economic globalization, a cosmopolitan understanding of the world, and immigration policies based on multiculturalism. In short, Trump’s discourses colonized the Democratic campaign. 2) Clinton’s campaign rendered narratives about who are the “good-Latinos” and, consequently, the “good-immigrants” and, at the same time, promoting values such as diversity and multiculturalism. Paradoxically, these narratives failed to portray the Latino community diversity. Studying these narratives expands the literature on Latino studies and political communication and, especially, offers a window to observe and interpret the cultural battles between those who support conservative and progressive values in Western democracies.\n","Abstract Body: In this essay I trace the legal and cultural advocacy work of Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), the largest Christian legal organization operating in the US today. The law firm has been involved in several high-profile religious freedom cases, including <i>Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd.<\/i> <i>v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission<\/i> (2018), in which a Christian baker refused to provide specialty services for a same-sex wedding. I locate ADF strategy within the longer history of a Christian persecution complex (Castelli 2007) articulated by the Moral Majority throughout the 1970s and 1980s. I then move to contemporary ADF advocacy in two domains: anti-transgender bathroom advocacy and religiously-motivated service denials. I perform textual analysis of ADF legal briefs, court transcripts, and model legislation alongside the organization’s website and YouTube channel. Ultimately I argue that greater attention needs to be paid to ADF not only as a legal advocacy organization but also as a cultural interlocutor.\n","Abstract Body: The constant need to respond to the media and to be visible in the press has brought a new type of actors in public bureaucracies: the communication professionals. In this article, we develop two ideal types of communication professionals, the <i>Government information provider <\/i>and the <i>Government spin doctor<\/i>. The ideal types are constituted by six dimensions, which together characterize the complexities of government communication professionals today: Recruitment criteria, bureaucratic values, loyalties, reputational concerns, contact patterns, and tasks. We apply the framework on a study of non-partisan communication professionals in Norwegian ministries. Based on surveys and in-depth interviews we show how communication professionals in the Norwegian case resemble both the government information provider and the government spin doctor. Our study show that communication professionals have internalized bureaucratic values and ideals, but these are somewhat in contrast to their politicized practices. The actor-centered, multi-dimensional approach presented in this article, should help guide future empirical investigations, enabling comparisons across countries with actors that are formal equivalents (recruited on merit, not politically), but functions quite differently.\n","Abstract Body: Visuals play a crucial role in online political communication, especially during election campaigns. Prior research on candidate imagery has shown effects from non-verbal behavior (e.g., smiling), contextual features (e.g., depiction of other people), and structural characteristics (e.g., camera angle and proximity). This study argues to look at candidate imagery as institutionalized means of political communication. In the realm of the European Parliamentary Election 2019, self-promoted imagery on social networking sites (SNS) is expected to align along party structures vis-à-vis imagery in the news, which is anticipated to align along national borders. We look at candidate imagery in both news and SNS across all member states by means of a computational content analysis. Findings show that while self-depiction on SNS includes more smiling, news imagery employs more variation in angle and proximity. Differences are almost independent from structural influences except for some country alignment. Implications for future computational research are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This article analyzes some of the communication strategies that populist leaders in Latin America utilized during their period as presidents. To accomplish this, we applied a populist communication model in order to describe the role of communications in Latin American populist governments.  The first part explains the theoretical model that identifies the communication practices of populist governments and differentiates them from other forms of political construction. Aside from the discourse style, populist leaders call for radical intervention in the media system. They seek to build their own (or controlled) media system in a confrontation with the external media system, which is identified as the opposition. In this context, direct communication assumes radical importance to consolidate the saturation of the public sphere through the presidential voice and to reaffirm the process of symbolic representation between leaders and their people. The second part of this article analyzes examples from Ecuador, Argentina, and Venezuela during the governments of Rafael Correa, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, and Hugo Chavez respectively, in order to identify particular features that could be understood as a populist communication strategy. The paper finishes with a consideration of the implications of this particular form of government communication with regard to its influence in both political and media systems.<br />\n","Abstract Body: News outlets with a reputation for partisan news could potentially broaden their audience and raise their credibility by violating expectations about the partisan valence of their content, either by highlighting neutral news content or by highlighting opinion content countering their own party. However, this runs the risk of alienating their existing audience. Using a purpose-built online news portal field experiment with individual-level random assignment to story availability, in Study 1 we found that exposure to all timely Fox News stories reduced partisan gaps in trust in Fox News, with this effect largely driven by decreased trust among Republicans. Study 2 instead manipulated exposure to prominent stories from Fox News, resulting in increased trust in Fox News among Republicans. Study 3 manipulated exposure to expectancy-violating editorials from a Fox News anchor in a laboratory experiment and found increased trust in Fox News regardless of partisanship. These findings have important implications for partisan news outlets as well as for multi-source news environments such as news portals and social media sites.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Political echo chambers, discursive gathering places where partisans discuss politics, are commonly characterized as “homophilous,” or comprised of people who agree with each other and avoid confrontation with ideas not compatible with their ideologies. This digital ethnography, carried out on discussions of the Democratic primaries in 2015 and 2019 on <i>The Daily Kos,<\/i> the largest progressive blog site in the United States, reveals that discussion on the site is marked by frequent incivility, driven in part by sectarian divisions in the Democratic party. However, whereas incivility is often understood as destructive, drawing on Herbst’s theory of incivility as a set of strategies with emotional power, this study demonstrates that incivility serves constructive purposes on the site in three ways, including preserving norms conducive to social cohesion, policing ideological boundaries, and as a disruptive mechanism for minority voices to command attention.<br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>echo chamber, incivility, homophily, counterpublics<br />\n","Abstract Body: Companies like Facebook and Mozilla Firefox have suggested crowdsourcing news credibility as a way to slow the spread of misinformation. Selective expression and corrective action hypothesis suggest that partisans would participate in these systems at differnt rates and give differing ratings. A 2 (choice/forced news rater condition) X 4 (mainstream, conservative, liberal, mixed news brand condition) experimental design was used to test these questions. Adults living in the United States (N=1,021) rated the trustworthiness of 20 news brands each. Results suggest that the partisanship of the news brand menu, the choice to participate in the rating or not, and the participant ideology interact to change both the trustworthiness rating of news brands and their relative ranking on a list of news brands. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Local news plays an essential role in ensuring the healthy functioning of democracy. However, local news outlets have struggled to stay open in the more competitive market of digital media. The factors contributing to this struggle are not entirely clear. Demand-side preferences certainly play a role, but supply-side decisions may also divert attention in ways that are harmful to local news outlets. To gain a better understanding of how one major set of gatekeeper-- online news aggregators--may be affecting the ability of media consumers to access local news outlets, we conduct an audit of Google News. While there is very little local news on the default portal, we find evidence that the composition of results returned by Google News depends heavily on the actual query used and not geographic or market-specific features.\n","Abstract Body: Testing for media effects on political attitude in the contemporary high-choice media environment, this study explores the political information sources and political attitude of immigrants who have access to both a relatively free information environment of their host society and a heavily censored information environment of their home society. We collected 521 valid responses from new mainland Chinese immigrants in Hong Kong through an online survey. The findings suggest that these new immigrants are exposed to mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, and overseas information sources simultaneously, with mainland Chinese sources being the most used. Exposure to mainland Chinese information sources predicts a relatively conservative political attitude and a further intensified conservative political attitude after migration, while exposure to Hong Kong and overseas information sources has the opposite effect.\n","Abstract Body: This study is a content analysis of the word “compromise” in discourse in the United States Congress, comparing a period of high public approval of Congress with a period of low public approval of Congress. All mentions of the word were coded into two major categories (governing-style and campaigning-style rhetoric) for the two separate time frames. Hypotheses were analyzed by using a measure of party polarity and from the mentions of “compromise” by Democrats and Republicans. Publicly available data from major polls was used to assess public approval of Congress. Chief findings include: (a) Democrats are significantly more likely than Republicans to use the governing style during a period of low public favorability and greater party polarity; (b) the greater the party polarity overall, the greater the public disapproval of Congress; and (c) by Congressional session, the greater the party differences, the less the Congressional productivity.\n","Abstract Body: <br />Partisans are divided in their non-political preferences, leading to prejudiced interpersonal interactions. In particular, significant attention has been given to how partisans are divided by their entertainment-media preferences, which may indicate deep divisions in taste associated with partisanship. However, this divide may only be minimal and associated with the abandonment of preferences in the face of the group-identity misrecognition and competing influences. To test both possibilities, I asked partisans to recommend films every American should see in their lifetimes and to justify their recommendations. These recommendations were then the basis for constructing an audience network, for which I assessed fragmentation. Similarly, I coded respondents’ justifications and then modeled the occurrence of themes on respondent features. Results provide little support for the existence of deep cultural divides. Democrats and Republicans recommended many of the same films and used the same justifications for doing so, suggesting that arguments over cultural divergence may be overstated.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the roles of user comments to online news for audience selection of online news sites and opinion climate estimations within and beyond comment sections. Content analysis of 12,000 user comments from the two leading online sources of political news in South Korea, namely <i>Naver<\/i> and <i>Daum<\/i>, showed the partisan division of comment sections despite no significant difference in partisan tones of the news offered. In <i>Daum<\/i>, pro-government comments received far more recommendations whereas anti-government comments got more recommendations in <i>Naver<\/i>. Survey analysis found that online news users tended to choose a news site consistent with the partisan direction of user comments found in the content analysis. Furthermore, online news users perceived hostile opinion climate from the comment sections, which related to the perceptions of general public opinion. The significance of user comments in online news environment for selective exposure and opinion climate perceptions is discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper traces the presence of democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang across three different medium: Twitter, traditional news outlets, and YouTube. A time-series and supporter network analysis reveal that: a) social media discourse was tightly coupled with YouTube search volume rather than news articles, and b) a dense but fragmented network of loyal supporters are leading the Andrew Yang discourse. Focusing on YouTube, we extend the literature regarding how different forms of social media can influence the electoral processes.\n","Abstract Body: This study shows that national leaders not only provide rationale for opinion building regarding their respective nations and contribute to the stereotyping of their citizens, but, also have the power to arouse in people living beyond their countries’ borders deep emotions as empathy or pro-social behavioral. In three experimental studies, we found that exposure to a positive article about a foreign leader, especially if that leader is perceived as popular in his country, led to (a) increased levels of empathy towards distress citizens of that leader’s nation, (b) willingness to help out (c) motivation to invest time in inspecting additional information regarding the circumstances that led to such distress; and (b) make an actual monetary donation for the benefit of those people. The results of this study show that national leaders are in a position to indirectly contribute to better and more empathetic inter-society relations and raise pro-social behavior around the world.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Politicians’ reticence to communicate their views clearly increases the information asymmetry between them and the electorate. We tested the potential of subtle visual cues to ideology (SBCs) to redress the balance. We used an experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 361) to test the effects of SBCs, and manipulated photos of a fictitious politician to include liberal or conservative SBCs. We embedded these images in Twitter posts and tested whether they influenced perceptions of the politician’s ideology and the intention to vote for him. We analyzed the relationship between exposure to SBCs, the politician’s perceived political ideology, and voting intentions—including the study of conditional effects elicited by cue awareness and ideological consistency between the depicted politician and participant. The conditional process analysis suggested that SBCs mattered, as they influenced citizens’ perceptions of a politician’s political ideology, and consequently, voting intention. These effects were moderated by cue awareness and ideological consistency. We concluded that SBCs can elicit substantial effects, and that their use by politicians are paying off.\n","Abstract Body: Social networking sites (SNSs) provide politicians with a platform to present themselves in a transparent and authentic way to the voters. Yet, to date, there is no systematic theoretical distinction and empirical investigation of different forms of candidates’ authentic self-presentation which are specific to the affordances of SNSs. Using two survey experiments, we manipulated three types of candidate’s self-presentation on Facebook, i.e., self-presentation focusing on the candidate’s (1) values, (2) relatability, and (3) interaction with voters. Additionally, we varied the candidate’s political ideology. Results of both studies showed that interaction-focused self-presentation had the strongest effects on voting intentions due to perceived closeness to the candidate. Study 2 additionally showed some support for the mobilizing effect of value-focused self-presentation, which could be explained by higher perceptions of authenticity and closeness. These effects were largely independent of voters’ shared identity with the candidate in terms of political ideology and gender.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Focusing on a polarized issue—U.S. gun violence—this study examines agenda setting as an antecedent of political expression on social media. A state-of-the-art machine-learning model was used to analyze news coverage from 25 media outlets—mainstream and partisan. Those results were paired with a two-wave panel survey conducted during the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Findings show mainstream media shape public opinion about gun violence, which then stimulates expression about the issue on social media.\n","Abstract Body: Animated GIFs are an increasingly convenient and popular mode of communication on social media. To make sense of political uses of GIFs, this study creates a typology based on Bucy and colleagues’ research on non-verbal, emotional displays by politicians in tv debates. This typology is then used to analyze representations of both non-verbal and verbalized political expressions by Twitter users in tweets (<i>n<\/i>=468) containing animated GIFs randomly selected from a large dataset collected during a primary election in August and the U.S.-Russia summit in Helsinki in July of 2018. This study demonstrates how animated GIFs are used for political expression in a multitude of ways, ranging from simple displays of emotion to substituting verbal debate tactics and other forms of political expression long established in political communication literature.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Politicians use social media platforms to connect with the public. However, who constitutes the public sphere to whom politicians actually talk and listen remains largely unknown, especially because network characteristics determine individuals’ visibility. Focusing on the Twitter network of all Swiss MPs, I identified 129,063 Twitter users with whom politicians connected (i.e., their follower–followee network) or to whom they talked and listened (e.g., [were] replied to or retweeted). I conducted a qualitative network analysis to describe the network and a semi-automated content analysis of the Twitter users to classify them (N = 70.589). The results show that the network is partially dominated by a power–law distribution of attention and is clustered by national languages but not ideology. Politicians talk primarily to citizens, who also react most often to the politicians’ messages. However, politicians listen more often to actors close to politics and the media than to citizens.\n","Abstract Body: Social media play an increasingly important role in political communication, especially during election times. A common indicator to analyze parties’ success on social media are user reactions to their posts, so-called popularity cues. Research on success factors of political actors’ communication on social media has recently increased. However, existing studies examining election campaign communication tend to focus on Twitter and neglect the important role of issues in highly competitive multi-party environments. In this study, we investigate party characteristics, the emphasis on political issues, emotional language, and mass media references as possible success factors of parties’ campaign communication on Facebook. We analyze the Facebook pages of the six largest parties prior to the national elections in Germany and Austria in 2017. Contributing to the growing field of political social media communication and popularity cues, we identify party extremism, profile-compliant and identity issues, and emotionalization as factors that help parties generate more audience reactions.\n","Abstract Body: It has become common practice for people to express their political opinions on social media, but not everyone is embedded in social networks where political expression is the norm. While research has focused on access and use divides, less attention has been paid to inequalities in social networks, their relationships to other socio-structural factors, and their relationships with relevant political outcomes such as political expression. This study helps to fill that gap in the literature by analyzing data from a nationally representative online survey (N=1,493) of adult Internet users in the United States collected just before the 2018 U.S. Midterm Elections. Results show significant relationships between network variables and political expression, and these variables also mediate the relationship between socio-demographics and expression. Results are discussed in light of literature on social media and the public sphere.\n","Abstract Body: Citizens frequently process political social media posts amid humorous context posts. Research on humor suggests that such context posts may stimulate or dampen political knowledge and participation depending on individuals’ political involvement. We conducted a 2x2 experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 286) in which individuals saw political posts embedded in either humorous or neutral context posts under either a low or a high political involvement condition. Humor boosted political knowledge gain in the low involvement condition and stimulated intended participation in the high involvement condition. Mediation analysis indicated that the effect on knowledge in the low involvement condition was mediated via general attention. For the lower involved, humor was not directly, but indirectly related to participation via attention and elaboration. Finally, we found no mediation paths within the high involvement condition. Taken together, we find predominately evidence that humorous environments on social media may have beneficial effects for political knowledge and participation.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Recently, the increasing prevalence of news snacking as a phenomenon that describes a brief, intermitted attendance to news in different contexts has been discussed as a problematic behavior potentially contributing to a less informed public. However, empirical research that investigates the effect of news snacking on knowledge acquisition through media use is sparse. Against the background of changed opportunity structures in a digital and mobile media environment, this study investigates how news snacking relates to the breadth and depth of political knowledge in society. To this end, a quota-based online survey was conducted among the German population (n=660). We introduce a newly developed measurement for news snacking and examine how this behavior affects the relationship between news use and political event- as well as background knowledge. Results indicate lower knowledge gains for people who exhibit high levels of news snacking across different types of digital news use.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study explores the influence of social connections on young people’s political knowledge. The analysis is based on longitudinal network data from thirteen residential student communities. Extending previous research on individual and group predictors of political learning, this work offers a nuanced look at the political impact of social relationships.<br />Results show that the political knowledge of participants is predicted by the knowledge of their strong social ties. Over time, repeated interpersonal interactions can be expected to both deliver important new information and change perceptions of community norms regarding politics. Those findings have important implications for research exploring social influence on political behavior. They suggest that the contacts we identify as political are not necessarily the ones that matter most in shaping our opinions and attitudes.\n","Abstract Body: This online experiment tested whether television serves as a knowledge leveler for immigrants with little education in the United States. Results showed that television narrowed the gap by somewhat stalling the growth of encoding and comprehension scores as education increased. Print widened the gap by increasing participants’ performance on comprehension with the increase in education. As the number of years of education increased, the positive effect of TV disappeared.\n","Abstract Body: In this study, we explore how the Twitter messaging of Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the first two presidents of the Twitter era, was amplified or hindered by the news media. We gather the full corpus of tweets sent by President Obama in the first year of his second term (N=2,218) and those sent by President Trump in the first year of his term (N=2,468), coding each tweet for tone (praise, criticism, or neutral). These data show that Trump’s rate of tweeting was steadier than Obama’s and his tone significantly more negative. We then gather all stories in the <i>New York Times<\/i>, <i>Washington Post<\/i>, and <i>USA Today <\/i>that referenced these presidential tweets. Our analysis shows that the press paid markedly more attention to Trump’s Twitter feed than to Obama’s, focused more on Trump’s critical rather than his positive tweets, and amplified Trump’s negative messaging. Our analysis also shows that tweet author (Obama vs Trump), tweet tone, and tweet virality (how often a tweet is “liked” and shared by followers) are important independent variables driving news amplification. We then use this dataset to explore how often tweets were visually embedded within news stories—an important aspect of hybrid political communication, particularly for President Trump, who has made Twitter an essential conduit for his daily brand management. Our data suggest that even early in Trump’s first term, incorporating presidential tweets into news stories became normalized and routinized, amplifying his distinctive Twitter strategy.\n","Abstract Body: The extent to which media technology influences social capital has long been debated. This research argues that two reasons hinder achieving further common understanding: (1) the social capital examined usually has different definitions and (2) most research contexts are limited to a single society. To tackle with these two issues, this study, following the micro- macro spectrum, firstly incorporates a wide range of definitions of social capital, including network size, generalized trust, and civic engagement. Second, based on the high-quality data of the International Social Survey Programme 2017, over 44,000 samples from 30 countries were analyzed altogether. Multilevel modeling was employed to model the country-level variance so as to identify the common patterns around the world. The results showed that both personal communication and technology-mediated communication generally foster, rather than erode, social capital at micro and macro level, even though technology-mediated communication attenuates the impact of personal communication on network size.\n","Abstract Body: Drawing from the constructivist paradigm in international relations, we explore the news media’s mechanism in shaping global norms. Unlike other non-state actors that successfully diffuse norms through explicit argumentation, we show that such is not the case for the news media. We compare how the news media and the epistemic community of public intellectuals influenced the World Bank (WB) to internalize the aid transparency norm. Using a time-series analysis (1975–2010) of Bank documents, <i>Google Books<\/i> text corpus, and<i> New York Times<\/i> coverage, we only find a bidirectional causal relationship between the academic discourse on transparency and the Bank’s discussion of transparency. However, negative news about the WB in general Granger-caused the Bank to discuss transparency. This “shaming” process, which is not explicitly about the non-adoption of the aid transparency norm, implies a complex route for the news media as a significant norm entrepreneur in international development and world politics.\n","Abstract Body: Waste pollution has become a worldwide concern, especially in China where rapid urbanization and mass consumption has exacerbated the waste increase. Engaged in the top-down policy advocacy, multilevel governments tried to translate the waste-sorting idea to the public through networked social media. Content analysis of government posts in the social media platform WeChat found that the advocacy through social media was no longer similar to the traditional top-down environmental movements; rather, the central and local governments seemed to have achieved a tacit agreement in the division of labor in administrative cooperation, and with different effect. We argue that social media provide a flexible and versatile vehicle to solve the structure problem of “principal-agent” relation between multiple level governments, in the sense that it creates a conduit for the central to problematize and initiate the environmental issue, and for the local to motivate local agents through emphasis on the benefits of local living environment and through organizational stress. It may consequently create an opportunity structure that transform the rigid hierarchical networks to a more adaptable and maneuverable one, and therefore strengthen environmental policy advocacy and mobilization.\n","Abstract Body: Recent research on disinformation and propaganda has identified radical right media such as Fox News and Breitbart as the principal incubator and distributor of intentional falsehoods. Given radical right media’s important role in spreading disinformation in the U.S., this paper explores the question of what kind of organizations radical right media are. In this paper, I challenge the common notion that most right-wing media are partisan news organizations that practice journalism with a partisan spin, and demonstrate that many radical right media have engaged in a wide range of political activities such as spreading disinformation and conducting opposition research. I argue that radical right media are better understood as “hybrid infopolitical” organizations that are able to shift among a diverse set of organizational repertoires in response to changing political conditions. Using Breitbart as a case, I highlight the important political function of radical right media and show how their political activities may shift as they adjust their goals, targets, and priorities in response to changing political conditions. I argue that the conceptual framework of radical right media as hybrid organizations can better account for what radical right media actually do and better address the implication of their activities for democracy.\n","Abstract Body: This paper analyzes the issue agendas of right-wing parties from six countries during the 2019 EP election campaign. Based on the assumption that right-wing parties mobilize on a transnationally shared issue repertoire, we investigate how far right-wing parties and candidates in France, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Austria, and Germany address similar issues in their campaign communication on Facebook. Results indicate a set of shared issues among right-wing parties such as immigration and blaming of elites as well as the talk about the campaign itself. Right-wing parties thus do mobilize their voters based on a transnationally recurring set of shared issues. However, national contexts such as the parties’ role in national politics (government vs. opposition) and party characteristics also influence right-wing issue agendas, leading to transnationalization with specific national shapes.\n","Abstract Body: After protestors clashed in Charlottesville, Virginia over plans to remove a Confederate statue, numerous mainstream news forums became spaces for discussing white nationalism. Using theories on ideology and discourse from Stuart Hall, this study considers how white nationalist discourse emerged. The findings show broad support for white nationalism, including complaints about threats to white culture and the reinterpretation of history, but also shows a burgeoning force of critics challenging white nationalism’s emergence in public spaces.\n","Abstract Body: In today’s complicated and diverse media environment, it is easier for an individual to be exposed to dissonant political ideas and only consume messages that are consonant with one’s perspective. And these changes in how citizens are exposed to political opinions in everyday life influence their attitudes towards politics. This very assumption led scholars to explore the relationship between exposure and polarization, because political polarity can now be witnessed in many nations, including the most democratic societies. The focus of this study is to explore the relationship between cross-cutting exposure, selective exposure, and political polarization based on an experiment using one of the most contentious political issue in South Korea. This will hopefully shed light on developing measures to alleviating polarization which is detrimental to formation of consensus and open communication.\n","Abstract Body: Partisan echo chambers, and selective exposure to partisan news more generally, are of key concern to communication scholars and the public. Recent research has largely focused on the role of the Internet or social media in catalyzing ideological isolation in the United States, by directing web-users into ‘bubbles’ of congenial information and opinions. However, this program of research risks overstating the polarizing role of the Internet relative to television, which remains the most popular medium among Americans, both for entertainment and for news consumption. Using an extremely large observational panel dataset from hundreds of thousands of Nielsen Company panelists, we first corroborate recent findings that online selective exposure to partisan news articles is minimal. We then go on to contextualize the scale of online news consumption against television news consumption, and then demonstrate that television audiences have grown increasingly loyal to their preferred television news channels between 2016 and 2018. We find that the number of Americans who were entirely loyal to FOX News or MSNBC approximated the populations of Pennsylvania (4% of the U.S.) and Oklahoma (1.2%) respectively as of December 2018.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Previous research posits that individual predispositions play an essential role in explaining patterns of selective exposure to political information. Yet, contextual factors in the political information environment have received far less attention. This article is one of the first to investigate, by means of cross-national and experimental design, how political information environments shape selective exposure. We rely on a unique two-wave online survey experiment in five countries (CH, DK, IT, PL, & US) with 4,349 participants to test the proposition that (a) the level of polarization and fragmentation in information environments and (b) the type of media source affect selective exposure. Our results reveal that selective exposure is more frequent among regular social media users, while less common among public service users, and – crucially – more common in information environments that are highly fragmented-polarized. News users from less fragmented-polarized media landscapes show one surprising yet intriguing behavior: when provided, in an experimentally manipulated setting, with greater opportunities to self-select than they may be accustomed to, their coping strategy is to pick larger amounts of congruent news stories. All our findings imply that contextual factors play a crucial role in moderating individuals’ tendency to select information along lines of political difference.\n","Abstract Body: Most scholars have agreed that a politically engaged public is beneficial to democracy because democracy, by definition, means \"\"rule by the people.\"\" However, politically active citizens do not always contribute to a healthy democracy. Especially in the post-truth era, politically engaged publics are more likely to spread misinformation that may undermine democracy than the less participatory counterparts. This study attempted to refine a theoretical understanding of this paradox of participatory democracy in the context of fake news by examining how and when politically attentive individuals share fake news. An analysis of national sample survey responses (N =197) showed that frequency of exposure to fake news bridged between political participation and misinformation sharing. This study also established partisan strength and the third-person perception as boundary conditions of the associations between participation and fake news sharing.\n","Abstract Body: This study seeks to advance our theoretical understanding of the relationship between emotions and social sharing of partisan media messages. We use observational data to examine emotional reactions to partisan media posts on Facebook during the 2016 election, and the relationship between emotions and sharing behavior. Our results reveal complex, non-linear relationships between emotion and sharing of partisan media. We demonstrate that political climate shapes ‘psychological readiness’ for emotion-driven sharing, such that the relationship between emotional response to partisan media and sharing behavior varies between political contexts that threaten partisan social identity and those that bolster partisan identity. A follow-up experiment conducted during the 2018 midterm elections confirms these results and validates the use of Facebook emoji “reactions” as proxy measures for specific clusters of emotions.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: emotion, selective sharing, social identity, partisan media, mixed methods\n","Abstract Body: We use pre-registered analyses of three national surveys (total N = 10,004) to examine perceptions of ability to discern false news, behavioral measures of actual ability, and actual media consumption using web traffic data. We find Americans consistently perceive themselves to be better than average at detecting false news. While perceived ability increases with actual ability, those who perform worst also overrate their ability the most. Most troublingly, though, greater overconfidence is associated with actual false news consumption. Overconfidence is also associated with intentions to share false news stories, belief in topical misperceptions, distrust of mainstream media, and higher trust in information seen on Facebook. This suggests that some individuals are simultaneously more likely to be exposed to and believe false stories, less able to discriminate between false and mainstream stories, and yet more likely to trust their own assessments and spread news. Taken together, we argue that overconfidence may be a crucial factor for explaining how false and low-quality information spreads via social media.\n","Abstract Body: There is widespread concern about false or misleading information online. Brazilians are particularly worried about this issue, registering the highest percentage of concern about misinformation in 38 countries (Newman et al., 2018). In this study, we present survey data of a representative sample of internet users in Brazil, the fourth largest democracy in the world. We investigate the relationship between dysfunctional sharing and: frequency of political talk; cross-cutting exposure; and social corrections. Results suggest that seeing and sharing misinformation is pervasive, with nearly a quarter reporting sharing misinformation on Facebook and WhatsApp. Social corrections occur relatively frequently in both platforms, with just under half having witnessed it on Facebook and on WhatsApp. Key demographics matter: those with more education report less likelihood of sharing misinformation by accident. Social corrections were more likely to be experienced or expressed on WhatsApp than Facebook, suggesting that the more personal or intimate nature of WhatsApp communication might influence social corrections.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Identifying antecedents of news sharing is a critical task for communication research. Yet, the study of news sharing remains scarce, U.S. centric, and largely oblivious to the cultural embedding of news. In this study, we introduce a global, cross-national analysis of news sharing encompassing news articles from 12 countries spread across six world regions. A multilevel model is proposed, linking a country’s structural and ecological system to online news articles’ share counts based on automatically derived news article features. We present and discuss preliminary results and are confident that by the time of the International Communication Association’s annual convention, we will have collected additional data and conducted additional, more refined, and theory-driven analyses.\n","Abstract Body: <br />This paper examines the style of user-generated debate on the public role of religion in the US by measuring outrage and recognition in user comments. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to explicitly capture both negative and positive dimensions of mediated debate computationally. Results show that the style of user-generated debate is more outrageous and less recognitive on platforms which mix public and private contexts and in debates that evolve pluralistically around issues.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Substantial evidences have pointed to the use of social media as facilitating political participation. Social media may reduce the gap of political participation among people with different levels of political predispositions; but it may benefit only those who are already psychologically involved in politics or the younger generations who are digital natives. The present study examines the extent to which using social media for information and socialization purposes is related to political engagement across citizens with different political internal efficacy and those of different ages. Two representative surveys were implemented in two Asian polities, Hong Kong (n = 493) and Taiwan (n = 700), both of which share Confucian heritage but have distinct political cultures. Results showed that, in both societies, social media use casted a stronger effect on elite-challenging political participation for those who had higher political internal efficacy. For the elite-directed political activities, in Hong Kong, social media use produced a stronger effect for those who had lower levels of internal political efficacy. In Taiwan, social media were more effective in mobilizing voting for those who were older. To conclude, social media may empower those “political have-nots,” acting as an equalizer to reduce the participation gaps in elite-directed political actions. For elite-challenging political activities, however, social media appear to enlarge, but not narrow, the participation gap.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been waging an information war, seeking to manipulate domestic and international public opinion in opposition to the recent anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Using agenda-building theory as a framework, this study analyzes the accounts of two official state media outlets, <i>People’s Daily<\/i> and <i>Chinese Central Television<\/i>, on Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. An analysis of the kinds of messages that have been tailor-made and framed for domestic audiences provides evidence that, under the regime of Xi Jinping, the CCP has used state media and digital propaganda to construct a political reality, send signals to specific audiences, and manage and mobilize public opinion domestically, in particular that of young people, as well as the opinions of interest groups overseas. With regard to the issue of Hong Kong, the CCP has been using new media to set an agenda and influence the city’s society, culture, and economy. The Chinese news media have thus been serving as cogs in the party’s political machine and their employees as government agents.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The present study examines the effects of capital-enhancing social media use on the demand for democracy in different political contexts. It contrasts the supply–demand hypothesis (i.e., social media use triggers the perception of an insufficient supply of democracy in current political institutions and raises the demand for democracy) and the social learning hypothesis (i.e., the demand for democracy is generated from an informed understanding of democracy). Path analysis based on the fourth wave of the Asian Barometer Survey conducted in mainland China (a single-party society, n = 1307), Hong Kong (a semi-democratic society, n = 889), and Taiwan (a democratic society, n = 949) found that social learning hypothesis was supported in Hong Kong and Taiwan: capital-enhancing social media use facilitated democratic understanding, and democratic understanding triggered democratic demand. The supply–demand hypothesis was only supported in Hong Kong. In mainland China, neither pathway of social media use was related to democratic demand.\n","Abstract Body: Modern authoritarian leaders have developed personality cults by constructing charisma and mass-disseminating it to the public in a variety of ways. This paper examines the personality cult of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State (IS), a totalitarian pseudo state/organization that took over and ruled large territories in Syria and Iraq from 2013 to early 2019. I argue that al-Baghdadi sought to cosntruct a distinct personality cult by cultivating auras of holiness and mystique. He situated himself in the historical tradition of revered Islamic religio-political leaders known as caliphs and claimed to be a descendent of Prophet Mohammed’s Quraysh clan. Unlike the prevalent practice of building personality cults, al-Baghdadi chose to be reticent and rarely made public or media appearances. And when he communicated with the public, it was primarily through voice rather than visual medium. This cast him as an enigma and mystery which he capitalized on to advance his charisma by becoming the subject of extensive media coverage and speculation around the world.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The waves of protest sparked by a government-proposed extradition bill in Hong Kong remains active and resilient. Compared to the 2014 Umbrella Movement, the protestors demonstrated stronger solidarity and tenacious tactics against the government and police crackdown. Meanwhile, the self-mobilised countermovement from government supporters evolved accordingly. While many scholarships focus on the utilization of new media for facilitating social movements, this research contributes to the literature on repression by studying countermovement discursive strategies. Through analysing social media posts, this study aims to identify how countermovement mobilization handles key controversial events; and how their responses sway the audience to endorse certain ideologies from state apparatus.<br /><br />Movement and countermovement<br />The largest social movement in Hong Kong since the handover was sparked by a government-proposed bill in February, which allows extraditing fugitives to authoritarian China. The movement escalated into waves of protests against police brutality and government misconduct since June. Over the months, protestors improvised a range of street tactics while actively rallying international support via various communication channels, where the Internet has become a significant battleground for discourse.<br />The confrontation between pro-democracy “Yellow-Ribbons” and the “Blue-Ribbons” who supported the police and regime, had created a prominent social cleavage since the Umbrella Movement. Polarization created two substantial forces, implying social movements initiated by Yellow-Ribbons would meet a Blue-Ribbon counteraction. Instead of solely suppressing the movement, the movement-countermovement (MCM) dynamics suggests competition brought by countermovement would sustain and keep the movement active (Meyer & Staggenborg,1996). This confrontation negotiates and constructs new rules, builds and rebuilds the sociopolitical system (Rummel, 1976), fueling both movements. They also mimic tactics or strategies from one another; sometimes shift arenas when faltering (Peleg, 2000). The spiral of action-reaction between movement and counter-movement suggests when one eclipses, the other to its demise.<br /><br />State-sponsored Countermovement<br />Modern ICT enables regimes to counteract social movements and sway public opinion by manipulating discourses online. Although censorship is common in mainland China for intelligence purposes and suppressing regime-threatening content (Qin, Strömberg & Wu, 2017), Hong Kong, outside the Great Fire Wall, has free Internet access. Nonetheless, freedom of speech is exploited, authoritarians can manipulate democracies by spreading misinformation or biased information (Badawy, Ferrara & Lerman, 2018). In China, state intervention on social media included flooding favorable information (Bradshaw & Howard, 2017). The Chinese government would fabricate a considerable amount of favourable information by employing the social media army nicknamed ‘50-cent party’ to overwhelm the audience; they do not engage in arguments but reconstructing the “common knowledge” and provide distractions (King, Pan & Roberts, 2017).<br />Facebook is the most popular social media in Hong Kong, used by nearly a third of the population while more than 44% cite Facebook as the first point-of-contact to breaking news (SCMP, 2018). Information manipulation is found on Facebook recently, Blue-ribbon groups and pages posting \"\"inauthentic\"\" contents was taken down (BBC, 2019). They are also closely related to the state, for instance, ‘Dot Dot News’ is affiliated with a party mouthpiece. This study examines these traces of Chinese state strategy and comparing media strategies in the Umbrella Movement for a broader picture of countermovement campaigns in Hong Kong. A number of popular Blue-ribbon Facebook pages are selected for analysis. The literature suggested two directions the countermovement could develop on.<br /><br />Evolving Countermovement since Umbrella Movement<br />Lee and Chan (2018) suggested three counter-mobilisation frameworks from Blue-Ribbons in the Umbrella Movement. They accused protestors for creating a public nuisance and damaging the rule of law; also, the intrusion of foreign powers.<br />The similarities between the Umbrella movement and the Anti-extradition movement suggest that Blue-Ribbons would develop their narratives based on these three frameworks. Firstly, the Umbrella Movement occupied main roads for 79 days, was blamed for the disrupted daily life and economy. The Anti-extradition protest persisted over 140 days, affecting multiple districts and sectors, is causing greater inconvenience to the public. Secondly, both movements triggered arguments about the rule of law. In the Umbrella Movement, the focus was on the legitimacy of civil disobedience while the Anti-extradition movement concerns a hampered independent judiciary. Lastly, both movements catch international attention that was accused to be foreign intervention. The Anti-extradition movement has an even greater international outreach, raising money for global advertising and connecting protesters worldwide. Therefore, the narratives criticising foreign powers for financially supporting protests to destabilize China is expected to linger.<br /><br />Distraction as media strategy<br />The theory proposed by King, Pan & Roberts (2017) that the Chinese government employs distraction on social media provided insights into the countermovement media strategy in the Anti-extradition movement. It implies Blue-ribbon Facebook pages would avoid arguing on controversies but promote their own agenda as a means for diverting attention. This phenomenon is expected to be prominent after occasions that sparked public outcry, such as police allegedly using excessive force and some mysterious deaths of protesters. Meanwhile, to divert the discourse, they might also take advantage of nationalistic sentiments which emphasize threats from the West which hinder Chinese rejuvenation (Wang, 2014). It provides a distraction away from the demands voiced by the protestors.<br /><br />Methods<br />Facebook posts during the Anti-extradition movement from Blue-Ribbon pages are examined. Five pages with over 100,000 fans are included in this study. The sampling period starts from 12th February 2019, four months before the massive protest that met police crackdown; and ends on 21 days after the naked dead body of a protestor was found floating on the sea, triggering suspicion in the public about the cause of death. All the Facebook posts within the timeframe are sampled into the dataset, using 'Facebook Scraper' python module.<br />Content analysis and quantitative text analysis would be employed. To understand the changes in media strategy as the movement develops, Facebook posts are arranged chronologically, grouped into time-frames defined by critical dates. In the content analysis, the same amount of posts is further systematically sampled from each time-frame and each page for coding. Items are coded for the nature of the post (accusing the protestors or supporting the government); framing devices used in countering the Umbrella Movement; and other critical factors. Content analysis outlines the countermovement strategy and its sensitivity to the evolution of the movement. The entire population of the data is further examined by quantitative text analysis using Quanteda, an R package (Benoit et. al, 2018). Topic models within each time-frame are extracted for identifying the salient topics on the pages, which are compared with big data to test for public concerns alignment. It evaluates whether Blue-Ribbon pages are distracting the discussion away from heated controversies.<br /><br />Expected Results<br />A sophisticated countermovement strategy is expected in Blue-Ribbon social media pages. The delegitimization of this movement would follow the framework observed in the Umbrella Movement. On top of that, they would eschew covering controversies such as suspected police collusion with triad on randomly attacking citizens, but rather provide an alternative agenda. A disjunct between public concern and issue salience on the Facebook pages are expected when key events triggering public outrage happened. Finally, the MCM model suggests the Blue-Ribbons would be reactive to the social movement. Therefore, their countermovement narratives, such as name-calling or smearing protestors, would change along with the social movement depending on significant moves from the movement camp.<br /><br />References<br />Badawy, A., Ferrara, E., & Lerman, K.

The current study considers a dichotomy of domestic/overseas media to examine the effectiveness of propaganda and information manipulation efforts. Introducing exposure to criticism, political trust, and national pride as mediators, this article employs path analysis to examine the impacts of domestic and overseas media on political orientations of mainland Chinese students in Hong Kong. Results show that domestic media use strengthens regime support while exposure to overseas media and overseas criticism attenuate regime support. Political trust and national pride significantly mediate the effects of media use on regime support. The study also showed that the mitigating role of overseas criticism is dampened among those who have higher level of cultivated threat. Yet, when cultivate threat is extremely high, exposure to overseas criticism reinforces support to the political system. However, interaction effects of cultivated beliefs are not found. Research methods, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Abundant anecdotal evidence suggests that non-democracies employ new digital technologies known as social media bots to facilitate their policies domestically and abroad, even in advanced democracies. However, no previous attempts have been made to systematically analyze the strategies behind the political use of bots on a large scale. This paper seeks to fill this gap by developing and empirically testing a set of hypotheses about the strategic use of Twitter bots in Russia. We test two competing macro-theories of bot activation as a response to offline protests or a reaction to domestic cyberconflict. In addition, we develop and test more fine-grained hypotheses about specific strategies for the use of bots. We show that although both macro-theories receive empirical support, the observed effects are more pronounced for the domestic cyberconflict theory. These results have implications for the theories of state propaganda and disinformation for diverse audiences both in modern competitive authoritarian regimes and advanced democracies.\n","Abstract Body: Over the past decade, digital platforms have pioneered a new mode for information distribution and social interactions. While much is known about the US-based platforms like Facebook and Google, much less work has been done on investigating digital platforms in authoritarian regimes. Bringing issues of digital politics to bear on platform studies, this article examines how China’s propaganda has been reinforced through a platform called Xuexi Qiangguo (i.e., Study the Great Nation). Using a mixed methods approach, we find that the technical architectures of Xuexi Qiangguo enable identical information feed but restrict content filtering, user network, and customization. Thus, the state can centralize propaganda to one platform and then decentralize information to individual users and offline communities. Most notably, the platform enacts a scoring and ranking system to assess user behavior and performance based on everyday usage, indicating that the platform allows state power to micro-target, real-time track, and classify users. We claim that the relationship between platforms, end-users, and service providers has been replaced by state-citizens relations, thereby China’s propaganda has been fundamentally strengthened through the platformization.\n","Abstract Body: A growing number of local governance innovations in China in recent years have been deliberation-inspired.  In this paper, we examine a recent example of such deliberative innovations.  It is a type of media forum called “media <i>wenzheng<\/i>.”  Taking Warren’s (2009) framework of “governance-driven democratization” as the theoretical entry point and Fung’s (2006) “democracy cube” as the analytical template, we analyze two media <i>wenzhen<\/i>g shows as different prototypes by using a combination of qualitative methods and analyzing materials from diverse sources. We argue that media <i>wenzheng<\/i> embodies a hybrid form of deliberative governance in two senses.  It follows a dual logic of both political governance and media production; it enmeshes the authoritarian power exercise and deployment of the democracy-sounding ideas of deliberation and accountability.\n","Abstract Body: With an increasing number of people, especially adolescents, using more private online platforms, such as WhatsApp, for news, an important question for democracy is whether such platforms can help learning about politics and current events. In this study, we examine adolescents’ affective, behavioural, and cognitive responses to interpersonal political discussion on WhatsApp. We conducted an experiment at secondary schools in the Netherlands (N = 148). We assigned respondents with strong ties to a WhatsApp group. For seven days, respondents received a link to an online political news item on a daily basis; and either had to read or read and discuss it. We also requested media links that have been shared in their own WhatsApp conversations in the past. We found that adolescents frequently share and receive links particularly from regional outlets, as well as from social media, broadcasters and tabloids. In addition, the results indicate that interpersonal discussion evokes stronger positive feelings, as well as issue-specific knowledge. In this way, instant messaging apps may serve as a resource for engaging adolescents with politics and current events.\n","Abstract Body: Levels of political cynicism are rising in many democracies throughout the world. At the same time, people are increasingly using social media not only to connect with friends and family but also to get news and political information. Although there are reasons to suspect social media use will encourage political cynicism, such a connection remains mostly unexplored to date. Using a two-wave panel survey of American adults (N=1,056) collected during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, this study examines whether both political and social uses of social media promote political cynicism. Data indicate that using social media for political purposes increases individuals’ levels of political cynicism over the course of the election. While social use of social media does increase the likelihood that people incidentally encounter political news, such accidental exposure does not subsequently make users more cynical. The data suggest that only explicitly political uses of social media, rather than social uses, contribute to political cynicism.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This article investigates how use of social media for news consumption influences learning about politics and current affairs. Relying on a national representative survey from Norway (<i>N<\/i> = 3,836) that included exhaustive measures of news consumption and news-finds-me (NFM) perceptions, as well as questions related to learning about politics and general political knowledge, we make two main contributions to this important emerging body of research. First, we show that the distinction between passive exposure and active attention to news through social media is essential to understand the negative effects of social media news consumption found in some earlier studies. Second, and relatedly, while earlier studies have mainly focused on the supply side to explain why social media news consumption should decrease knowledge levels, we suggest that motivational and ability factors are relevant as well. More precisely, we emphasize how general political knowledge and NFM beliefs among individuals using social media affect what they learn from social media news consumption. The results emphasize the dynamic interaction between opportunity structures, individual motivation, and ability as crucial to understanding the consequences of news consumption in the high-choice digital news environment.\n","Abstract Body: Although previous studies indicate a generally positive association between social media use and general trust, the differential impacts of social network sites (SNS) and instant messaging (IM) on general trust have yet to be fully elaborated. By addressing the ambiguity in conceptualization and operationalization in previous studies based on social capital theory, the present study articulates the distinct impacts of SNS and IM on general trust with a specific focus on the mediating role of the diversity of personal networks. Analyses of survey data from Hong Kong (<i>N <\/i>= 987) demonstrate that SNS use has a positive indirect effect on general trust through increased network diversity, whereas IM use has both negative indirect and total effects on general trust through decreased network diversity. The differential consequences of SNS and IM use on general trust are discussed from the network-centered perspective of social capital.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Although popular users are more influential on social media, there may exist a<br />popularity fallacy in terms of their public participation. We examined the<br />relationship between the popularity of the most influential verified users (i.e.,<br />Big Vs) of Sina Weibo and their participation in 63 most salient public issues.<br />The results support the existence of popularity fallacy for Big Vs. Although the<br />popularity of Big Vs has an indirect positive impact on their public<br />participation because of the mediation of public influence, the popularity of<br />Big Vs has a direct negative impact on their participation in public issues.<br />Taken together, the popularity still has a negative impact on public<br />participation. We further explain the findings in the perspective of social<br />identity and impression management. The results of this study shed light on our<br />understanding about the limited role played by social media for public<br />participation in China.\n","Abstract Body: To disseminate research, scholars once relied on university media services or journal press releases, but today any academic can turn to Twitter to share their published work with a broader audience. The possibility that scholars can <i>push<\/i> their research out, rather than hope that it is <i>pulled <\/i>in, holds the potential for scholars to draw wide attention to their research. In this manuscript, we examine whether there are systematic differences in the types of scholars who most benefit from this push model. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which there are gender differences in the dissemination of research via Twitter. We carry out our analyses by tracking tweet patterns for articles published in six journals across two fields (communication and political science), and we pair this Twitter data with demographic and educational data about the authors of the published articles, as well as article citation rates. We find considerable evidence that article citations are positively correlated with tweets about the article and we find little evidence to suggest that author gender affects the transmission of research in this new media.\n","Abstract Body: Digital media allows individuals to easily form and join online communities away from the public eye. While research has documented visibility online amongst those with extreme political viewpoints or those in authoritarian regimes, it has done little to account for the rise and role of political secrecy amongst <i>mainstream<\/i> partisans in liberal democracies. This study explores the distinct qualities of secret online communities for mainstream partisans in the U.S. Through interviews with secret group leaders and a digital ethnography of a secret political Facebook group of progressives. I find that mainstream partisans use digital media to form secret groups when they are the minority in their community. I find that the secret group operates as a <i>community of solidarity<\/i> for those reticent to disclose their political beliefs to an incongruent community and as a <i>community of contention<\/i>, where individuals both criticize and revitalize the minority party in their region. I also find that the group operates as a <i>community of practice<\/i>, allowing members to learn from and rehearse political communication amongst like-minded others before taking their practice elsewhere. These results hold implications for how scholars theorize and study politics in a digital and polarized era and for how journalists, campaigns, and political parties gauge public opinion.\n","Abstract Body: This article examines the representation and use of quality time. It brings together an analysis of images tagged and shared under the hashtag #qualitytime on Instagram with an investigation into the trope’s resonance in everyday life. In the interviews and profiles studied in this article, people used the term to indicate and display instances of self-determined solitude or of fulfilling conviviality in which mobile phones and social media were conspicuously absent. At the same time, the notion required them to carve out and valorize moments of purpose, a goal that was often unattainable. Use of the hashtag was thus accompanied by both the opportunity and the obligation to aspire to temporary retreats in which free time was employed for meaningful activity. This means that the somewhat pretentious keyword signifies the ideal of temporal autonomy while also pointing to the slim chance of finding uncompromised spells of time within harried leisure.\n","Abstract Body: This essay argues that, in the Trump era – starting with his active campaign for the US Presidency in 2015 and his subsequent administration – classed bodies, and especially working-class bodies, are used in advertising to reflect prominent values and ideological tensions that have arisen during Trump’s reign.  Advertising has used class-based representations to critique Trump and his policies; to depict working-class hardships under Trump; and to celebrate white working-class masculinity, authoritarianism, and classed masquerades.  Each of these themes highlights a particular tension indicative of the Trump era.  Often contradictory, such representations highlight stereotypes about the working-class and serve to solidify often stifling lessons about class in society.\n","Abstract Body: This paper argues for a renewed focus on the political character of cultural intermediary work and outlines how such an emphasis can illuminate broader cultural and economic processes at work today. Using UK charity sector public relations and communications practices as a case study, we explore the tensions manifested in cultural intermediary work which necessarily interconnect with politics and the political,. We argue that the processes, practices, objects and values of cultural intermediation manifest the political in a wide and under-appreciated range of forms, while the charity sector is interfacing with politics and the political in new ways. Further, we maintain that cultural intermediary work is engaging with broader trends in promotional culture, marketization and media practices to create new formations that are deeply politicized.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This article discusses how one of the most Instagrammed places on Earth, Disneyland, reveals contemporary cultural changes related to place, identity, and media. Even though parks and resorts are the second largest revenue generator for the Walt Disney company (higher than the film studio), less academic attention in communication studies has been paid to theme parks as a medium. Using the concept of territorial mediatization—a process where media logics are infused into physical place—this article focuses on how logics unique to Instagram are replacing older media logics in Disneyland. These new logics have resulted in vibrantly colored food and merchandise along with special events that are available only for a limited time to encourage repeat visits for additional photo-ops. To do this study, a two-week sample of Instagram posts from users with over 10,000 followers using the hashtag #disneyland was collected and analyzed. A grounded constructivist approach was used to study the posts in depth, taking into account both the photos and captions. Results show fantasy elements of Disneyland, such as escapism and happiness, are favored on Instagram over other historical elements of the parks, such as exotic adventurism, frontierism, faith in technology, and midcentury American values. The highlighting of fantasy elements also shows how Instagram can be used as a means of amusement and escape for young people in late capitalism. In turn, Disney parks have savvily responded to the experience economy by synergistically integrating new media logics. As a result, the intersection between Disneyland and Instagram shows how space is being transformed for the lenses of consumers seeking experiences, food, and merchandise to capture and document online. Identity is also being reshaped through corporate brand ambassadorship and fandom culture, which has important implications for how scholars understand the relation between media, global capitalism, and culture.\n","Abstract Body: The present study explores the aural appropriation of racial, ethnic, and gendered differences in the production of an increasingly popular—though undertheorized—medium: digital audiobooks. Examining medium specific scholarship, this work first compares historical and contemporary debates about the role of narration versus performance in audiobook production. Subsequent analyses of popular and pedagogical discourses among modern audiobook producers reveal the ways in which these debates are presently used to justify “gender bending” and “bombast accents” in an industry dominated by white men. Additionally, I reveal that industry professionals primarily police the aural crossing of gender lines in audiobook production when it violates hegemonic gender norms. Conversely, performing racial and ethnic difference through accents is uncritically expected, accepted, and framed as an inherent part of audiobook storytelling. Further, through a critical case study of Jeffrey Deaver’s acclaimed straight-to-audiobook, <i>The Starling Project<\/i>, I illustrate how contemporary audiobook producers may achieve sonic story-world coherence through appropriating gendered and ethnic differences—however, in ways that re-inscribe and privilege hegemonic sociocultural conventions. Future implications for media appropriation scholarship and audiobook production are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Full Paper<br />The worldwide popularity of anime has attracted many scholars to investigate the reason of the phenomena and the potential influences it brings to anime fans. This present study collected 33462 topics of threads from two biggest American and Chinese anime forums from 2015-2019. The study combines semantic network analysis and discourse analysis to study the perceive attitudes towards anime of anime fans. The results demonstrate that anime fans from America and China generally shared similar patterns on the forum. However, there are evident differences of preference anime genre between the two groups. Additionally, fans from these two cultural backgrounds hold particularly different views about female image in anime. American anime fans are more vocal about the interest of male, whereas Chinese fans stands from the feminist position. The varieties indicate how cultural and societal background may shape fans’ attitude and identification.<br />            <i>Key words<\/i>: Anime, Fandom, Semantic Network Analysis, Discourse Analysis <br /> <br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper offers a feminist perspective on the construction of meanings in relation to the public relations occupation, focusing on the role of embodied cultural capital in constructing a professional identity. Feminist scholars have identified a strong relationship between consumption and the body, an intersection in which promotional work plays a key role in shaping notions of femininity and promoting both neoliberalism and consumerism. This paper considers how such ideas play out in relation to diverse representations of public relations’ bodies and in the management and gendering of an occupational identity. It documents a somatic turn and moves beyond a discussion of pop culture representations of female practitioners to consider the self-presentation of the practitioner body. In analysing a practitioner-celebrity body and images submitted to an industry website, the findings point to the unwritten rules concerning dress and other occupational codes of the industry and the significance of aesthetic labour, where the worker’s appearance help determines occupational success. The findings suggest a reorientation of consultancy work from corporate public relations to an alignment with other cultural industries, where the (fashionable) body is central to this performative identity as a cultural and/or promotional worker.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines the two public controversies which occurred in quick succession in 2018 around the routines of two female comics: Michelle Wolf’s monologue at the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner, and Samantha Bee’s segment on the policy of separating children from their immigrant parents at the border, which contained a crude insult about Ivanka Trump.  Both incidents attracted attention and commentary far beyond the reaches of the performers’ usual audiences.  In the wider conversation that unfolded and the myriad voices that weighed in, there was a much broader discursive struggle taking place over ideals and norms.  This paper argues that it was a battle over conceptions of femininity and motherhood, and, ultimately, over how to be a woman in the public sphere.  Not incidentally, defense of the jokes’ victims revolved around their status as “wives and mothers,” while disavowals of the joke tellers focused on the vulgarity of their use of profanity and sexual innuendo.  Overall, these incidents ultimately drove home the way in which female performers have become hot spots in the “culture wars,” themselves sites of battle over ideals of gender, power, and public space. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This article examines the mechanics of choice in contemporary society by studying structures of two interactive fiction or “choose-your-own-adventure” games <i>Choices: Stories you Play<\/i> and <i>Episode –Choose Your Story<\/i> and their accompanying free-to-play profit system. Neoliberal choice (Chen, 2013) was approached as a strategy (de Certeau, 1984) that operates by encouraging actualization of one’s best self yet inscribing what it should entail. Despite the rhetoric of player agency and fictitious simulation, the “best” choices and endings in the games were visible and accessible only with cultural, economic, and temporal capitals. Their designs urged the players to embody legitimate taste to pick “right” choices that largely conformed to societal norms, and the “right<i>est<\/i>” choices often required monetary transactions. However, players’ subversive choice-makings such as choosing to not play, choosing encoded choices to pursue one’s negotiated readings, and collective participation hinted at the potential of tactical practices in creating new strategies.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: neoliberal choice, interactive fiction game, choose-your-own-adventure, choice, strategies and tactics, capitals\n","Abstract Body: Examining activist struggles over the reproduction of culture in media franchising strategies, this paper locates in the \"\"social justice reboot\"\" an articulation between the industrial management of change and the politics of transforming representation, access, and privilege in consumer society. Through media franchising, the threat (or promise) of change in casting, marketing, and more trigger struggles over cultural privileges in the past, industry priorities in the present, and the ongoing dispositions of media franchises inevitably reproduced into the future. In this struggle, the ultimate stakes of the social justice reboot turn on the question of who will hold, gain, or lose cultural power as these industrial processes of reproduction unfold.<br /><br />Although these issues prove relevant across the wide range of intellectual properties implicated in media industries' franchising logics, this paper looks explicitly at the 2015-2019 management of <i>Star Wars<\/i>, developing an instructive case study to reveal industries’ reproductive strategies and political struggle over them by producers and consumers. Starting with <i>The<\/i> <i>Force Awakens<\/i> (2105) but moving beyond to include the franchised management of change across other films like <i>Rogue One<\/i> (2016) as well as transmedia brand extensions like <i>Forces of Destiny<\/i> (2017), it is possible to see the social justice reboot unfolding in tension between activist forces seeking to influence the course of that reproduction and industrial forces managing that potential change. First, through analysis of <i>Force Awakens<\/i> not just at a textual level, but attuned to forces of production and reception that generate meaning from that text, we can see how the franchise reboot can be articulated to discourses of change, diversity, and social justice politics. By following that franchising process, we can secondly examine how online hashtag activists—primed to consider the <i>Star Wars<\/i> franchise in these politicized terms—confronted the reboot’s ongoing promise of industrial change in relation to feminist and alt-right politics alike. Finally, by considering the industrial management of this capacity for change by Disney and Lucasfilm, we can see how this balancing act between familiarity and difference transforms social justice into a manageable media commodity. In this sense, the rebooting of <i>Star Wars<\/i> is significant not because of its divergence from previous narratives (or failure to do so), but instead because of its power to render media franchising a site of political struggle over social justice – one in which social justice is itself rebooted as the commodifiable output of that industrial process.\n","Abstracts: Pervasive cultural anxieties have recently been expressed across media and advocacy reportage about inappropriate new children’s genres on YouTube. Implicit in this commentary is a concern about the role of child audiences in shaping new genre formations, with child viewers anxiously framed as co-creators of unfamiliar, inappropriate genres. While childhood fan experiences are often considered in theorisations of fandom and personal identity (Rebecca Williams 2015; Matt Hills 2002), child fan practices and audience cultures are not often accounted for in fan and audience studies. Yet child viewers – a group marginalised in both scholarship and culturally via entrenched adult-child hierarchies – are positioned as threateningly empowered in discourse about children’s YouTube genres. This presentation argues that children’s YouTube fandoms are seen to work alongside the “ambivalent” platform logics (Jean Burgess 2018) of YouTube to create new genres on the platform that do not align with existing cultural expectations around child-appropriate content.\n","Abstracts: Fandom has often been lauded as a “safe space” through invoking discourses of mental health and engaging with issues of mental illness and disability. The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) fandom in particular enables diverse readings from a disability perspective because of the superhero genre’s expansive focus on narratives of ability. Furthermore, the global popularity of MCU points to the transnational and transcultural framing of its fandom. This paper analyzes the responses of globally diverse Marvel fans about their enabling and disabling experiences in fandom through an online survey. This approach will be helpful in understanding if (and how) fandom functions as an enabling platform by empowering fans, or if it as an exclusionary space that can contribute to fans’ marginalisation and disablement. Through this I will also explore the multiple ways in which disability is understood, experienced, and engaged with by racially and culturally diverse fans.\n",null,"Abstracts: This paper investigates the way that Asian American audiences responded to <i>Crazy Rich Asians<\/i>, analyzing data from marketing, news reports, fan-activism campaigns, social media posts, and blogs. Doing so helps to illuminate the challenges media studies scholars face in locating audiences of color who fly under the radar, or who feel excluded from more traditional fan communities. I argue that these different sites for audience formations are constrained by particular affordances and expectations, but that Asian Americans are working to exceed and resist these limits in order to achieve visibility and fully express what this cultural production means to them. Asian American audiences are capitalizing on this opportunity to call attention to their particular values, struggles, and intellectual engagements, and in doing so, expose some of the contradictory and heterogeneous possibilities for Asian American audience engagement that are often left out of fan studies scholarship.\n","Abstracts: Media fandom has been historically examined as generative of transformative fanwork, particularly around axes of gender and sexuality (Busse, Lothian, and Reid 2007). However, this relationship has been complicated in recent times with the increase in the number of canonical queer characters in Western popular cultural media texts (Pande 2018). This paper takes up the character of Thunder, played by Anissa Pierce in the CW show <i>Black Lightning<\/i>, to examine fandom discourses around queerness, representation, and racial identity. Hailed as the first Black lesbian superhero on television, Thunder has so far failed to gain the traction and visibility afforded to white queer characters like Alex Danvers (Chyler Leigh) on the CW show <i>Supergirl<\/i>. Using an intersectional lens, I argue that it is vital for fandom scholars to look closely at fandom’s interactions with queer characters beyond broad claims that “representation matters.\"\"\n","Abstracts: Perhaps more than any cultural industry in the UK, publishing is the most acutely aware of its own institutional whiteness (and middle-classness). While this has led to a number of workforce initiatives, there is also big push to diversify a publisher’s frontlist, that is, to publish more writers of colour. Based on an in-depth study of the publishing industry, involving over 100 qualitative interviews, this paper focuses on how agents and editors are searching for more ‘diverse’ talent and how this makes ‘writers of colour’. In particular, it interrogates the words of an editor who suggested that to be a writer from a minority background is ‘an advantage right now’. The paper explores how minorities working in publishing – either as writers or as cultural intermediaries – make sense of this moment, and what their reflections reveal about the nature of racism in contemporary cultural industries.<br /><br />Dr Anamik Saha is a Senior Lecturer at Goldsmiths, University of London.

In what ways are such individuals making use of digital media and technology as part of their (self)education? Beyond the context of higher education, where are Black women developing their media and cultural studies skills and what does this suggest about contemporary issues concerning structural inequalities and the study of media and culture? Drawing on in-depth interviews and analysis of public discourse, this paper explores some of the nuanced media and cultural studies experiences of Black women in Britain, who face forms of structural oppression that are impacted by the intersections of racism and sexism. This work reflects on some of the ways that the media and cultural studies landscape in Britain has changed in recent decades, while considering how this connects to the current and potentially future experiences of Black women in Britain.<br /><br />Dr Francesca Sobande is a Lecturer in Digital Media Studies / Director of the BA Media, Journalism and Culture programme, Cardiff University.

More particularly, it scrutinizes how these so-called ‘Swifties’ deal with their object of affection and her political position through analyzing online comments about this reveal. Through this exploration, I offer a snapshot of how politics is empirically manifest in a mainstream pop music fandom – a genre and space often overlooked when it comes to discussing politics. Doing so, this study clarifies how fans give meaning to politics in mainstream pop: they consider it a potential career-strategy, or defend it as a ‘must’ for pop stars in today’s world. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Star worship is an ever-growing phenomenon in China, which is currently home to the largest number of active fan groups in the world. However, in the context of the social media age, where a new relationship model between fans and stars has emerged, the motivation source and model of star worship is little studied. This study used a grounded theory approach, in-depth interviews with fans, and semantic analysis of online texts to define a new model of imagined relationships between fans and stars, namely the parakin relationship, where fans identify as the family members of their idols, and a dual-motivation model of self-oriented and star-oriented motivations behind this relationship. The findings provide a new perspective for examining the self-upgrading of fans’ roles and the optimization of the production paradigm of mass culture and reveals some new theoretical trends in the study of star worship\n","Abstract Body: New information and communication technologies have reshaped production, distribution, and consumption of artistic works in the entertainment industry. A notable example is South Korean pop music, or K-pop, that has achieved considerable transnational popularity on social media, video-sharing sites, etc. Chinese social media are an appropriate context for understanding the success of K-pop. Different types of K-pop accounts are active on social media in China. This research investigates the concept of co-creation on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, in these three accounts: K-pop labels, K-pop stars, and K-pop fans. The case of Jackson Wang (Jackson Wang Ka Yee), a K-pop star supported by JYP Entertainment, is studied in this research. The findings illustrate that three groups of stakeholders jointly promote the star: the company as a marketer, the celebrity as self-marketer, and the fan organization as an information hub. They portray the celebrity with slightly different images.<br />\n","Abstract Body: In recent years, hip-hop music has rapidly become popular among Chinese youth, and gradually evolved from a type of underground culture into a mainstream music form in China. Based on the concept of cultural hybridity, we analyses how American hip-hop culture influences and interacts with Chinese hip-hop music. Through textual analysis of some influential Chinese hip-hop songs, we find that Chinese rappers mix American street culture with local “Jianghu” culture in the process of imitating American hip-hop and creating a new genre of Chinese hip-hop culture. On the one hand, rappers attempt to circumvent the Chinese government's censorship of some sensitive topics like drug, crime or violence. On the other hand, their efforts demonstrate that Chinese rappers hope to create a kind of hybridized hip-hop culture, which rooted in the local context for Chinese audiences, and also contain some original cultural factors, such as the street consciousness and masculinity in American Hip-hop culture. This paper provides a new perspective for understanding the cultural hybridity in globalization by analyzing the hybridity of Chinese hip-hop as a complex case, and it can help us to understand the concept of “glocalization” that bridges the East and the West culture.\n","Abstract Body: In Hong Kong, the 2014 “Occupy Central” movement and the 2019 “Anti-Extradition” protest both witnessed a widespread use of local popular music as a repertoire to mobilize public affection and solidarity. However, only a decade ago, HK pop music was receiving strong criticism regarding its abuse of brainwashing melodies, naïve/toxic love stories, and pop idol worship, which was argued to drive youngsters away from active and critical engagement in political and public affairs. This drastic change initiates my primary research question: how does HK popular music become politicalized? Using a method of triangulation, this study first conducts an in-depth, critical reading on academic research of HK pop culture and media interviews of singers and lyrists to trace the historical changes of HK society and its pop industry. It then conducts a textual analysis on the lyrics and themes of the mainstream pop songs in the past decade, which reveals the change of narrative and ideological patterns. Altogether, the result affirms that current HK pop music is experiencing a process of politicization under specific historical, social, and cultural-political contexts. Specifically, this study identifies the rise of “critical localism” as the “core category” that drives this process of politicization. But furthermore, surrounding a musical event during the 2014 “Occupy Central” movement, this study also conducted an online ethnographic observation examining how the politicalized localism in HK was decoded differently by audiences from mainland China. Overall, departing from a dualistic discussion about whether pop music can politically mobilize its audiences, this ethnographic episode of HK attempts to offer an innovative, historical and trans-border approach to examine how and under what specific circumstances the politicization of pop culture is possible, which may also advance relevant studies in other regions worldwide.\n","Abstract Body: This essay demonstrates trans*(ing) as an analytic for critically interrogating NETFLIX’s <i>Queer Eye<\/i>.

Many scholars have looked at this music as a form of counterculture, taking interest in the ways in which the ways many African American youth participants of this scene perform and communicate their gang affiliations and amplify street conflicts on social networking sites. This work has provided many meaningful depictions of the ways in which street violence can possibly be interrupted through the monitoring of the social media accounts of urban youth. Even so, academic work has paid very little attention to the unique relational labor practices and technological ingenuity employed by the musicians to sustain viable careers. Based on 25 interviews with artists in Chicago's Hip-Hop scene, I explore the content and character of their work, the centrality of the work ethic to their identity construction, and the way rappers use social media work to build and maintain status, authenticity, and digital tools and technologies to cultivate connections with fans, friends and other cultural producers. Bridging traditional theories of urban sociology with emerging new media scholarship, I suggest that the technological savvy within this group of artists is uncoincidental and a case representative of how the strategic social hacking of youth of color is an overlooked yet essential part of their professional success. To conclude, I argue social hacking is a skill required by youth of color in low income communities to sustain participation in digital media cultures and society at large could stand to gain by not overlooking their creativity and ingenuity to make new (and distinct) trendsetting media practices.\n","Abstract Body: Drawing insights from the sociology of expectations and recent studies on future visions in communication studies, this article traces and analyzes how <i>Wired<\/i>—a technology news provider and socio-technical vanguard whose vision is to uncover technological innovations—anticipated socio-technical visions of online ratings and reviews over two decades (1998-2018). The qualitative textual analysis of the <i>Wired<\/i>’s coverage (<i>n <\/i>= 82) revealed two socio-technical visions, namely, promissory futures and problematic futures. The former embraces how online ratings may promote the values of trust, transparency, and consumer empowerment, whereas the latter questions if these very same values can be maintained in possible futures. Importantly, problematic futures did not necessarily suggest an abandonment of the technology. The visions represented in <i>Wired<\/i> largely followed the logic of “technological solutionism.” This study affords opportunities for thinking about the role of popular media discourses and temporalities in shaping imagined futures of emerging technologies.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Social media platforms like Instagram are at the centre of the largest commercialisation of public life and intimate experience in history. These platforms engineer techniques for the production, circulation and machine-processing of images and video. In this paper we focus our attention on the machine vision systems of social media platforms like Instagram. We outline a novel approach for exploring the visual culture of Instagram by examining the representational and operational qualities of images. We build a novel scraper and machine vision system and employ it on a set of 13000 images posted to Instagram from the Splendour in the Grass music festival in 2018. By doing so, we critically explore how the capacity of machines to cluster and classify images posted to Instagram is interdependent with the mediatized enclosures of popular cultural spaces, events and performances, and their participatory cultures. By examining how a machine vision system operates on Instagram images we develop a critical argument about the role of machine vision in the algorithmic brand culture of social media platforms like Instagram.\n","Abstracts: The relational approach to public diplomacy has been conceptually discussed since the 1990s (e.g., Grunig, 1993; Signitzer & Coombs, 1992) and has been empirically tested in recent years (e.g., Lee & Jun, 2013; Tam & Kim, 2017). The relational principles (i.e., mutuality, symmetry, dialogue, or trust building) (Brown, 2014) are fundamental to enhancing mutual understanding and mutual influence (Fitzpatrick, 2017). Even though communication approaches such as social media listening and engagement (e.g., Dodd & Collins, 2017) have been promoted, it is important to identify factors and barriers that motivate foreign publics to or not to be in a relationship with a country (Storie, 2015, 2018). From the perspectives of publics (Tam & Kim, 2019), both countries and publics have to select certain countries and publics to build and maintain relationships with (due to resource constraints). In view of this, I propose to study and explore the challenges in the relational approach to public diplomacy. In a recent Lowy Institute Poll, only 38 percent of Australians aged under 45 found the U.S.-Australia alliance to be important (Seymour, 2019). According to Tkalac Verčič, Verčič, and Laco (2019), there is a decrease in mutuality between countries toward common issues. This raises a question: does the relational approach achieve the outcomes desired, how and why and under what conditions?<br />My proposed research seeks to challenge various notions within the relational approach. First, on the pursuit of mutuality, differentiation must be made between enhancing mutual understanding and addressing mutual interests. For mutual interests (which is outcome-focussed), countries must first understand foreign publics’ self-interests. Second, on the promotion of symmetry, it must be acknowledged that there is existing power asymmetry which cannot necessarily be addressed. Third, to engage in dialogue, it must be recognized that the philosophical roots of dialogue acknowledge that dialogue is not entity-driven and requires mutual accommodation. Lastly, trust building also consists of integrity and competence which is more action- than communication-oriented. To address these challenges, I propose new relational constructs to be conceptualized and tested.\n","Abstract Body: The understandings about digital diplomacy are still in flux. Many scholars take the state-centric approach and focus on its broadcasting dimension. This study attempts to reconceptualize digital diplomacy with the public-centric perspective. Based on the online political participation framework, it introduces four modes of online diplomatic participation: expression, interaction, membership, and campaign. The new definition emphasizes digital diplomacy’s engagement dimension and sheds light on the active role the general public play in today’s diplomatic scene.\n","Abstract Body: This paper initiates an exploration of how self-perceptions of role and identity held by practitioners of public diplomacy impact the practice of public diplomacy. It is founded on affordances from Critical Identity Theory that assert a connection between identity and communication. The researchers use Q Methodology, a scientific method for the study of subjective perception, to initiate an inquiry into how diplomats, particularly public diplomacy practitioners, see themselves in their role as a communicator. This paper joins other public diplomacy scholarship on the impact that changes in communications, technology, foreign policy institutions, and social networks have on the profession. It seeks to add to the dialogue research on practitioners themselves as essential elements of the public diplomacy equation. This paper commences with an inquiry into perceptions of American diplomats; it will be followed by further research that crosses cultural and national boundaries.\n","Abstract Body: Across academia and governments, it is generally recognised that digital tools – and social media in particular – are now part of everyday diplomatic activities. On the other hand, new, pressing problems are emerging due to a range of cybersecurity threats, including an increase in the frequency of automated accounts and the dissemination of fake news and digital propaganda. As a reaction to these increasing concerns relating to the internet, I describe a shift in the Australian foreign policy articulation and interpretation of the internet. From the internet as a communication platform that allows for listening to and dialogue with foreign publics to the internet as strategic infrastructure that requires defending and guarding. The attention is, thus, moving towards short-term ‘defensive’ goals – as a result of a higher perceived fear of the latest evolution in the geopolitical context. I connect this shift with the concept of the “institutionalisation of empathy and fear” developed by Crawford (2014) and I apply it to an Australian case study. In this paper, I argue that emotions in international relations, as in human relations, are invisible but leave traces in the policy articulation. The shift in Australian foreign policy indicates a form of institutionalisation of fear in response to the challenges emerging from the digital environment. I conclude by noticing that a more belligerent international environment highlights the tension between national interest – which evolves and changes due to political shifts and contextual elements – and the understanding of public diplomacy engagement as mutual understanding and mutual influence.\n","Abstract Body: Open communication and open science can be seen as part of the global commons that are part of the multilateral system of international relations between states. Nevertheless, in 2019, there still exists a need for a greater understanding of Science Diplomacy (SD) and ownership of scientists’ potential role in the governance of the global commons and the operation of public diplomacy. In the absence of an existing conceptual framework for such an undertaking, this paper reports on taking a social constructionist approach and adapts a strategic positioning framework to a SD case study. We examined how SD was discursively constructed in four submissions, submitted to a public call for contributions to inform the 2018 Australian Government White Paper on Foreign Affairs. Our study examined if these actors employed SD discourses in strategically positioning the concept, themselves and others. We found the submissions’ authors applied deontic power to self-assign, or assign to others, an array of rights, duties, obligations, requirements and entitlements. In so doing, they proactively self-positioned as SD actors, with a stake (or seeking a stake) in future developments in this area. An array of practices that fostered the concept of ‘Diplomacy for Science’ were enacted as an intentional positioning strategy with goals ranging from solving global science challenges, through to strategically positioning individual people and organizations for future funding success. Whilst this study is exploratory and small scale, it shows how applying a strategic positioning framework allows for the conceptualization of SD under the wider umbrella of public diplomacy. In so doing, the structures of public diplomacy are made more open, and thus open to critique and discussion, as well as making more transparent the processes by which actors seek to shape those same structures.\n","Abstract Body: Corporations are critical nonstate practitioners of their home countries’ public diplomacy. In<br />particular, a corporation’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities may fulfill the function<br />of public diplomacy and help to boost the home country reputation in the mind of international<br />publics. In the study, two between-subject online experiments with two different sets of stimuli<br />were practiced to empirically test a theoretical model about the effects of CSR messages on<br />publics’ perception of home country reputation. Empirical evidence revealed that simply<br />including CSR information in corporate press releases may not directly impact on the<br />perceptions of country reputation. However, it was found that corporate reputation mediated the<br />effect of the presence of CSR information on country reputation. Practical implications for public<br />diplomacy practitioners and corporate professionals were discussed.\n","Abstract Body: State-led strategic communication programs with the goal to enhance a country’s reputation and image abroad has become a wide-spread practice and significant tool in foreign politics, also among small states with little geopolitical relevance. But do such states even have the necessary leeway to successfully implement their communication strategies on a global scale? This study assesses this question based on international media resonance of states. Relating to the theoretical approach of country news value literature, we implement a comparative research design analysing news coverage on the three German-speaking countries Germany, Austria, and Switzerland through multi-level automated text analysis of 11.538 news media articles in Arabic. In accordance with existing empirical and theoretical contributions, we find that high status states have more resonance-based leeway. Nevertheless, resonance-based leeway of smaller states with lower status is defined differently, i.e. by their political, rather than their economic or military power.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Repressive regimes have upped their investment in public diplomacy tools to compete with democracies in the flow of information. Although Turkey is considered the world’s first jailer of journalists, its media market is one of the fastest-growing in the world. In 2015, the world was introduced to the Istanbul-based English-language TRT World with its slogan \"\"where news inspires change\"\". It promised an impartial coverage of global news through its experienced journalists targeting global audiences. In this regard, this study investigates the interplay between public diplomacy, authoritarian regimes, and the editorial independence of international broadcasting channels such as TRT World. After conducting in-depth interviews with TRT World journalists, we can conclude that TRT World has not succeeded in becoming Turkey’s public diplomacy tool and only became Erdogan’s voice to the world. TRT World, if not to change how it functions, will turn into a propaganda machine.\n","Abstract Body: The purpose of the present study is to explore how post-crisis CSR message attributes and pre-crisis dialogic engagement might influence publics’ skeptical perceptions of companies’ CSR efforts in a situated corporate crisis, and how CSR skepticism might further influence publics’ corporate evaluations.<br />Drawing from prior research on crisis communication, CSR skepticism, and dialogic engagement, we seek to connect pre-crisis and post-crisis efforts to examine the effectiveness of various crisis management strategies.<br />We conducted a 3 x 2 x 2 between-subjects online experiment using the Qualtrics panel. Participants were recruited to go through a mock company’s crisis situation at three stages, respectively (1) pre-crisis engagement with publics on social media, (2) crisis itself, and (3) post-crisis CSR activities varying in stated motive and issue congruence on social media.<br />Through the experiment, we found stating public-serving motive in post-crisis CSR or launching an incongruent CSR initiative heightened some aspects of CSR skepticism. Yet conditionally, explicit statement of motives in incongruent CSR can help inhibit skepticism and subsequent corporate evaluations. Moreover, we further found pre-crisis dialogic engagement could serve as the cushioning moderator to help manage the corporate crisis situation.<br />Our findings theoretically contributed to existing research on crisis communication and CSR. We also provided critical insights for PR managers in future crisis management practices.<br />Taken together, the present study greatly facilitated understanding of corporate crisis as a process that requires companies’ constant management efforts to cope with corporate crises that can occur in an unexpected manner.\n","Abstract Body: Organizational crises are emotionally charged occurrences for both organizations and their stakeholders. There has been a growing body of research on how emotions affect corporate reputation. This study investigated if expressing discrete emotions during a crisis had an impact on corporate reputation, and whether the effects of emotional expression depended on the crisis response strategy adopted. A between-subjects three (communicated emotion; anger vs guilt vs no emotion) × two (response strategy: rebuilding vs denial) experiment was designed with 922 participants. The findings show that, in the context of a severe crisis, rebuilding strategies result in a more positive corporate reputation compared to denial strategies and that remorse was superior to anger regardless of response type.<br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> public relations, crisis communication, crisis response strategies, corporate reputation\n","Abstract Body: <i>Purpose:<\/i> This paper expands situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) to narrative persuasion strategy.<br /><i>Theoretical Approach:<\/i> Recent public relations scholarship has emphasized the need to embrace narrative theory. This paper presents the first experiment to coalesce storytelling with SCCT by testing the impact of response types on attribution of responsibility and organization reputation, ultimately affecting an organization’s reputation.<br /><i>Methodology:<\/i> In a randomized experiment (<i>N<\/i> = 365) featuring a news interview of a scandalized company, an organization’s spokesperson responds to a journalist’s questions through (a) on-topic narratives, (b) off-topic (spinning) narratives, or (c) nonnarrative information.<br /><i>Key Findings:<\/i> Serial multiple mediator modeling assesses relative effects of response types impacting organizational reputation through attribution of crisis responsibility followed by attitudes toward the organization. Consistent with SCCT, on-topic narratives and nonnarrative information reduce the public’s blame toward the organization, enhancing attitudes toward the organization, and ultimately bolstering the company’s image. However, the public ascribes more responsibility to the organization for causing the crisis when the spokesperson subverts questions through narrative spinning.<br /><i>Practical Implications:<\/i> Given that storytelling comes naturally to people, crisis managers may take comfort in the empirical affirmation that narratives can embolden an organization’s image. Perhaps spokespeople will handle news interviews better, knowing they are permitted to answer tough questions through sharing personal stories of the company rebuilding.<br /><i>Originality:<\/i> Considering the recent growth in public relations scholarship endorsing the implementation of narrative strategy, this experiment presents a valuable first experimental test of crisis response narratives via SCCT.\n","Abstract Body: Purpose: Product recalls have become a common occurrence for the automotive industry in recent years. Due to the media’s prevalence as a major source of information for consumers, it is important to study the effects of the media on recall-related situations. General Motors’ 2014 recalls are unique in that it had elements of a crisis (e.g., many injuries and deaths), a scandal (e.g., ethical mishandlings due to the time delays).<br />Theoretical approach/background: This study therefore attempts to analyze how the GM case might perhaps be indicative of a scansis, particularly since recent research has differentiated the terms of “crisis,” “scandal,” and “scansis,” thereby affecting potential practical implications.<br />Method: Using content analysis, the strategies as reported by <i>The New York Times<\/i> will be examined, with this case study extending the usage of SCCT in scansis contexts.<br />Key findings: General Motors’ situation is unique in that they did experience a scansis, rather than a crisis or scandal, in the fallout from the 2014 recall series.<br />Practical implications: It is important for organizations to understand whether they are facing a crisis, a scandal, or a scansis as the best practices may differ accordingly.<br />Originality and innovation: This case study provided insight into how the organization was perceived throughout the 2014 recall series, as well as the types of response strategies and their subsequent effectiveness<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study aims to explore how brand fans (i.e., consumers who identify with a brand) can be prompted to protect a brand’s reputation during crises and how the selection of a crisis spokesperson can influence consumers’ evaluations of the offending organization’s reputation. Using a 2 (crisis response strategy: diminish vs. rebuild) × 3 (source: brand organization vs. brand representative employee vs. brand fan) experimental design, this study explores the role of crisis information sources and brand identification in post-crisis communication. We suggest that consumers who more highly identify with a brand are more likely to accept their brand’s crisis response and evaluate their reputation positively, which can also contribute to a willingness to engage in positive, electronic word-of-mouth on social media.\n","Abstract Body: Publics have become active participants of crisis communication. Their comments posted in the digital media, often juxtaposed alongside the organization’s response, defend the organization (e.g. Brown & Billings, 2013). Limited research exists on the interplay between the crisis communication offered by the organization and active organization supporters, or faith-holders (Luoma-aho, 2015).<br /><br />Based on the Situational Crisis Communication Theory (Coombs, 2015), the principles of co-creation of meaning (Botan & Taylor, 2014), and framing (e.g. Entman, 1993), this research simultaneously study crisis communication responses at three levels: organization, media, and public.<br /><br />Based on a case study of Tesla Motors crisis, the researcher conducted analysis of content of the crisis communication strategies offered by the organization on its website, the organizational crisis communication strategies appeared in the digital media articles, and the crisis communication strategies offered by organization faith-holders in the comments left in response to the digital media articles.<br /><br />The findings indicate that faith-holders became active participants of the crisis communication recognized by both the media and the organization. Their strategies differ from the organization and they address issues the organization does not address.<br /><br />The findings indicate that, responding to the crisis, public relations practitioners need to understand how the meaning of organizational crisis communication is co-created by different actors in different media. Knowing this, public relations practitioners can craft a more holistic crisis communication response.<br /><br />The study extends the theory of SCCT to faith-holders and contributes to the scholarship on the co-creation of meaning.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The contentious issues endemic to many cases within social issues management share a common feature: intractability. This study takes steps toward clarifying and defining the concept of intractability as part of public relations engagement with contentious challenges, asking how practitioners make meaning of intractable issues. Data from in-depth interviews with 41 practitioners provide a detailed examination of the engagement challenges with intractable issues. This research extends social issues management theory by defining four facets of intractability through which contentious issues can be understood and categorized: degree of intractability, issue type (natural or situationally driven), issue locus (internal or external), and practitioner identity involvement.<br />\n","Abstract Body: As a specific form of corporate social responsibility (CSR), corporate social advocacy (CSA) expands our discussions on the role of businesses in socially or politically controversial issues. There remain many unanswered questions about this newly emergent phenomenon. PR theories offer fruitful theoretical perspectives on issue management, publics, responsibilities, ethics, and communications, which are also crucial for CSA. Practitioners need to consider diverse publics’ interests and needs to better engage them cognitively, affectively, and behaviorally. When an organization is advocating a potentially controversial issue, it is likely to arouse some publics’ interests, leading to more salient (dis)engagement behaviors. When companies step into controversial issues, different publics have their own issue awareness, issue involvement, issue supportiveness, and their past knowledge, all of which affect their CSR information processing, and thus perceptions. This essay explains how PR theories, especially engagement theory, facilitate our understanding of this new emergent CSR form, and propose several propositions about CSA communication process. The topic of CSA should be explored by clarifying its definition, identifying its engagement strategies, and examining its multilevel outcomes.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: corporate social responsibility, corporate social advocacy, public relations, engagement theory<br />\n","Abstract Body: This research study examines the conditions under which companies advocating for social issues might be more successful in their approach. Utilizing theory in corporate social advocacy and organization-public relationships, relational outcomes are assessed in conjunction with a company taking a stand on a controversial issue when the company is perceived as either values- or results-oriented in its decision-making. Research questions are examined through a nationally representative survey of over 1,200 U.S. adults. Findings from this study revealed that perception of a company as values-orientated in its decision-making fully mediates the relationship between relational outcomes, attitudes towards the company, and supportive intentions. Values orientation partially mediates the relationship between taking a stand and attribution of motivations, as well as attitude towards the CSA itself. These findings suggest that companies wishing to drive social change should have clearly articulate values as part of their decision-making process and promote these values to the public in advance of CSA initiatives. Companies can serve as trusted actors for social change initiatives when acting on divided issues.\n",null,"Abstract Body: A <i>paracrisis<\/i> is a reputational threat that must be managed in public view, and which if not effectively mitigated can turn into a full-blown crisis. Using fairness theory as a theoretical tool, the study asks whether the type of paracrisis is determined by the level of perceived unfairness, and whether the effectiveness of an apology depends upon the type of paracrisis and/or the level of engagement with the public. A 2x2 factorial survey (N = 320) sought to experimentally test the interaction effects between CEO apologies (both <i>dialogic<\/i> and <i>monolithic <\/i>utterances), the type of paracrisis (<i>moral<\/i> or <i>operational<\/i> paracrisis), and their effect on stakeholder eagerness for a boycott of the company. The finding is that a tweeted apology was found to be more effective in an <i>operational<\/i> paracrisis than in a <i>moral<\/i> paracrisis, and when it is in the form of a dialogic utterance rather than a monolithic one. Notwithstanding wide acknowledgement of the importance of dialogue and SM engagement during organizational crises, there has been little research seeking to measure experimentally the degree to which dialogic apology and SM engagement has behavioral consequences, such as alleviating public readiness to boycott a company. Our findings suggest that credible company engagement with SM and individuals' experience of dialogic interaction with the organization can reduce the perceived seriousness of a paracrisis, thereby mitigating willingness to engage in consumer boycotts.<br /><br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>fairness theory, paracrisis, apology, dialogue, engagement, boycott<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br />Purpose of research and research gap: When corporations were hit by major crises, well-crafted and effectively communicated apologies by CEOs could function positively to repair and rebuild a damaged corporate image. Nevertheless, limited research has examined CEOs’ stance negotiations manifested in the apology discourse from an interpersonal semantics approach. This study probed into the use of crisis response strategies in corporate apology discourse and analyzed leader’s interpersonal stance negotiation through the lens of appraisal framework.<br /><br />Theoretical approach: This study drew on appraisal framework, analyzed discursive construction of preferred crisis response strategies in corporate apology discourse.<br /><br />Methodology: This study employed a two-stage mix method approach where quantitative content analysis was employed to investigate the dominant crisis response strategies in stage one while stage two examined how these strategies were discursively constructed in corporate apology discourse.<br /><br />Key findings: Findings suggested that Attitude resources and its subcategory of Appreciation resources were employed in all crisis response strategies identified. Furthermore, negative Affect resources were found to be salient in the construction of Mortification strategy, in contrast to the predominant use of positive Appreciation resources in Corrective Action.<br /><br />Practical implications: The findings provide practical values to crisis managers, public relation professionals and pedagogical implication to teachers of business communication/ public relations writing course on how to craft effective corporate apologies.<br /><br />Originality and innovation: This study offers a new perspective on studies of corporate apologies discourse and sheds light on the strategic employment of evaluative appraisal resources to negotiate CEOs’ stance via corporate apology discourse.\n","Abstract Body: Purpose - Experimental research contributed significantly to the field of crisis communication by examining how the elements that make up a crisis response (e.g., content, emotionality, nonverbal behaviors) affect public perceptions of organizations and public figures in crisis. The current study aims to understand how these effects translate to and operate in “the real world” by taking a qualitative look into how members of the public interpret real-life audiovisual crisis responses in which all these separate elements are joined together.<br />Methodology - Through three focus group discussions in which members of the public (N = 22) discuss real-life audiovisual crisis responses of organizations and individuals in crisis, this study explores which aspects of crisis communication that received much prior research attention (e.g., responsibility, apologies) actually matter in shaping public perceptions of crisis responses and why.<br />Key findings - The findings align with evidence-based guidelines put forward by prior experimental studies in the sense that apologies, emotions and nonverbal behaviors are important in shaping opinions of individuals and organizations in crisis. However, the effectiveness of recommended strategies seems to depend upon several factors and their overall success is determined among others by the extent to which they appear sincere.<br />Implications - The findings add a more nuanced understanding to the existing knowledge in crisis communication as established by prior experimental research and offer guidance for putting theory into practice.<br />Value - The study shows that evidence-based guidelines in crisis communication should not be implemented in a merely strategic manner but with a clear ethical focus in mind to reach reputation repair.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Abstract (73 words)<br />The purpose of this study was to examine issue-specific and organization-specific factors that may influence customers’ reactions to allegations of environmental irresponsibility.

Few studies have sought to investigate the concurrent effects of issue- and organization-specific factors on organizational outcomes in case of corporate misconduct allegations.<br />Theoretical approach and background: This study focused on the idea of brand-identity fusion to examine how it may act as a figurative shield against the negative impacts of misconduct allegations. The situational theory of problem solving was also used as a theoretical framework.<br />Methodology: Online surveys were conducted among Australian citizens in October 2018. Participants were first asked to identify the mobile phone brand that they currently used, asked about their relationship with the brand, and then shown a fictitious vignette alleging illegal dumping perpetrated by the brand.<br />Key findings: Brand identity fusion lowered customers’ perceptions of perceived moral inequity and triggered rewarding behavioral intentions despite the allegations. Situational motivation about environmental issues was found to positively affect boycotting intentions and lower buycotting intentions.<br />Originality and innovation: This study represents one of the first to integrate organization-specific and issue-specific predictors of customers’ reactions to corporate misconduct. The idea of brand identity fusion as a relational shield against the negative outcomes of corporate irresponsibility allegations presents public relations scholarship with rich insights and potential for future theory development.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Given that a regenerative crisis life cycle is no longer static, communication dynamics are not limited to organization-receiver relationship, but also receiver-receiver relationship in social media environment. This paper analyzes and explicates the socio-cultural meanings in the situated interaction processes of the crisis publics.<br />Blending the concept of Internet trolling into predominant crisis communication theories (i.e. social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC), integrated crisis mapping (ICM) and regenerative crisis model), we propose a regenerative crisis model of publics to highlight their roles, purposes, interaction processes, and emotions within a situated socio-political tension.<br />Using cultural discourse analysis (CuDA), we analyzed the top influential posts, comments and responses based on the five discourse hubs or radiant of identity, relation, action, dwelling, and emotion in the Lancôme case, which was regarded as the most heated crisis in Hong Kong after the Umbrella Movement.<br />The findings suggest that the motivations and behaviors found within each of the crisis publics––primary influencers, secondary influencer, and followers (i.e. haters)––are fundamentally different from each other along the situated crisis regenerative by nature. Four types of social media influencers were also identified.<br />Defining social media publics should take contextual factors into consideration, especially in regenerative crisis within a situated socio-political context.<br />The concept of Internet trolling provides a new perspective to understand behavioral patterns and effects of social media influencers. The use of CuDA analysis provides empirical evidence to understand the detailed and dynamic communication process among social media publics along a crisis life cycle regenerative by nature.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Crisis misinformation, including false information about a crisis or a crisis-stricken organization, has become a fundamental threat to organizational wellbeing. Effective crisis response geared toward fighting crisis misinformation demands a more systematic approach to corrective communication. Grounded in misinformation debunking theory, this study aims to advance misinformation research in public relations and organizational crisis communication. An online experiment using a U.S. adult sample (N = 817) was conducted to examine the effects of corrective communication strategy (simple rebuttal vs. factual elaboration) and employee backup (present vs. absent) on perceived message quality, organizational reputation, and perceived crisis responsibility. Results show: 1) the use of factual elaboration and the presence of employee backup were direct contributors to crisis response effectiveness; and 2) perceived message quality mediates the effect of corrective communication. This study provides insights into advancing crisis communication theory and offers evidence-based recommendations for practitioners to combat crisis misinformation more effectively.\n","Abstract Body: Abstract<br /><br />Purpose:<br />To explore Indian corporations’ move from a single spokesperson to a multiple spokespeople model using employees as spokespeople for CSR communication on social media, and the implications of that shift.<br />Theoretical approach:<br />The empirical data is analysed from the perspectives of CSR communication, stakeholder engagement through social media, and organisational legitimacy.<br />Method<br />Data were collected through qualitative, in-depth interviews with 27 Public Relations managers, Company Heads, and CSR managers responsible for the planning, implementation and communication of corporate CSR initiatives in India. Interviewees were selected by a snowball technique across corporations who must comply with national regulations for compulsory CSR activity.<br />Key findings:<br />Because of increased activity on social media by external stakeholders, their distrust of official spokespeople and messages, and the fact that these stakeholders purposefully tag employees in directing their questions, Indian corporations have widely turned to a multi-spokespeople model that uses employees for stakeholder engagement via social media.<br />Implications:<br />The companies that use employees for CSR communication have experienced decreased stakeholder aggression, greater engagement, and increased outside acceptance of corporate messages – all of which suggest increased corporate legitimacy. Those companies that involve employees in CSR planning and implementation as part of organisational culture experienced most success.<br />Originality<br />While prior research has explored employee involvement in the planning and execution of CSR initiatives, this extends that work by looking at the use of employees as spokespeople for CSR communication, especially on social media.\n","Abstract Body: CSR communication and corporate reputation are two important issues attracting an increasing amount of attention from both communication and business scholars and practitioners.

This study intends to understand the knowledge construction process of CSR research in the communication discipline from a network perspective.<br />Theoretical approach and background— Invisible college was adopted as the conceptual framework. The invisible college has been widely adopted to study the interactions via citation practices among scientists within a common research area. Because scientific article requires specific bibliographic references to attribute credit to others’ original works, citations are considered as interactions among the authors and those whom they cite.<br />Method— This study conducted bibliometric network analyses with four steps: article search, paper inclusion and exclusion, in-text citation content analysis, article network analysis, and theory/concept network analysis.<br />Key Findings—Results showed that in the past four decades, CSR literature has experienced significant growth and this sub-areas in communication has been maturing, as evidenced by the increasing volume and diversity of theory and concept applied. Moreover, besides those from management and business, public relations constructs and theories were found to contribute tremendously to CSR scholarship development in the communication disciplines.\n","Abstract Body: When negative issues and crises arise, employees can develop negative employee communicative behaviors such as negative megaphoning. This paper aims to find the factors that make employees more leaning to carry along such negative actions by examining the type of employee-organization relationship and organizational resilience. Crisis history, exchange relationship, self-efficacy, and sense-making were significant predictors of negative megaphoning. Findings and their implications were discussed.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Abstract<br />Although the research and practice in internal communication has grown significantly, especially in the past decade, no systematic efforts have been done to examine the state of research relevant to this specialization. Our study accordingly content analyzed all published articles in six major public relations and mass/strategic communication journals (N = 132) from 1990 to 2019. Content analysis results identified key scholars and their affiliations, charted publication growth within the past 29 years, summarized the state of research trends in the published works, and proposed directions for future research on internal communication.

More specifically, MI tells people where to go for more information or tells them how to act (Hungerford & Lemert, 1973; Lemert, 1984; Lemert, Mitzman, Seither, Cook, & Hackett, 1977). In the case of disaster communication where the public seeks information they can act on that will keep them and their families safe, MI seems to be an appropriate litmus test to determine whether disaster communication is timely, clear, consistent, and detailed enough to help with self-mobilization during a disaster event. This study examines what, if any, features of MI (e.g., location, identification, tactical) appear in current disaster communication. Additionally, to date, there has been no research to examine MI within the context of disaster communication on social media. Therefore, this study explores MI through a content analysis of tweets sent by government and media organizations before, during, and after Hurricane Florence slammed into coast of the Carolinas in September 2018.\n",null,"Abstract Body: <br />With drastic changes of the media landscape, public risk communication and trust building face new challenges. The competition for attention is fierce, and lengthy, complex arguments do not fare well. Tried and tested rhetorical strategies of risk communication come under pressure when appeals to emotions and personal beliefs dominate in fragmented social media “bubbles” where people seek to get their views confirmed without being exposed to counter arguments. In this regard, the lack of trust in health authorities is displayed by, for instance, antivaccine groups on Facebook. This essay briefly reviews the literature on vaccine hesitancy and trust, and then integrates insights from these literature streams in analysis of the rhetorical situation of public risk communication on health. Reviewing the research on vaccine hesitancy and trust building through the lens of the rhetorical situation points towards five key principles when formulating a content strategy on vaccination: (1) vaccine hesitancy can be legitimate for certain risk bearer populations; (2) tailoring of messages to the various hesitancy drivers; (3) necessary to understand that what is perceived as trustworthy is also situational; (4) areas of uncertainty where no exact knowledge exists, the character of the speaker becomes more important; and (5) that there is an indirect route to strengthening ethos that depends on understanding risk bearers. The focus is on the key rhetorical conditions and implications for content strategies concerning vaccines.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <i>Purpose of research and research gap<\/i>—As one of the earliest empirical attempts to uncover CEOs’ leadership communication roles in the startup context, this study examined how startup CEOs’ use of motivating language influences employee relationships with the startups.<br /><i>Theoretical approach and background<\/i>—This study adopted leader motivating language theory (MLT) (Mayfield & Mayfield, 2018)—a leadership communication theory originated from the speech act theory (Austin, 1975)—as the theoretical framework for entrepreneurial leadership communication.

Moderator analyses suggest that the cultural context and organization type moderate these bivariate relationships. Namely, tests of differences in the effect size showed that the relationships between public engagement and OPRs (i.e., trust and satisfaction) differed for subjects from the U.S. and those from China or Korea. The relationships between public engagement and OPRs (i.e., trust and satisfaction) were different for for-profit organizations versus governmental and non-profit organizations, such that the relationships were stronger among for-profit organizations than other types of organizations. Similar patterns were also detected for the relationships between openness and OPRs.<br />Practical or social implications: Cultivating relationships among the organization and publics requires organizations to be transparent and be willing to disclose organization-related information and engage publics.<br />Originality and innovation: Synthesizing the existing literature on openness, engagement, and OPRs quantitatively help build consensus in those relationships.\n","Abstract Body: Purpose of research<br />CSA is an emerging corporate communication practice that gains increasing importance in the contemporary political environment. This study aims to extend the psychological distance research to the CSA context and understand the influences psychological distance on publics’ CSA perceptions.<br /><br />Theoretical approach and background<br />Drawing upon Construal Level Theory, this study examined the polarizing/depolarizing effects of perceived psychological distance on CSA expectation and evaluations among people with different party identities (i.e., Democrats/Republicans).<br /><br />Methodology<br />To examine the effects on publics’ CSA expectation and evaluations, an experiment was conducted with perceived psychological distance as the primary independent variable, publics’ identification intention with the company as the mediator, and party identities as the moderators.<br /><br />Key findings<br />The study found that publics with a closer perceived psychological distance to the company tended to have a higher CSA expectation on the company. However, perceptions of close psychological distance resulted in mixed effects regarding attitudes and buycott/boycott intentions. Publics’ identification intention with the company played a mediating role in these relationships. The asymmetrical effects between Republicans and Democrats were also found.<br /><br />Practical implications<br />Researchers suggest that companies’ key publics have growing expectation on companies to appropriately engage in social-political issues. Practitioners should consider not only their key publics’ party identities, but also publics’ feeling of closeness to the company when planning CSA strategies.<br /><br />Originality<br />This study contributes to the extant CSA literature by providing a more comprehensive understanding about how publics’ perceived distance, identification with companies, and their party identities together influence CSA outcomes.\n","Abstract Body: Preparing for natural disasters can save lives. This study examines how government public relations can effectively communicate disaster preparedness to help at-risk publics better prepare for natural disasters. Studies so far have taken exploratory approaches to identify factors motivating disaster preparedness actions, yet fragmented studies have not provided an integrated model to guide disaster communication on the most effective factors for explaining and predicting disaster preparedness behaviors. This study attempts to build an integrated model and identify the key factors that motivate disaster preparedness behaviors, through large-scale online surveys and structural equation modelling (SEM). Two most federally declared disasters in two U.S. states with over 20,000,000 residents are studied: California (wildfire risk, <i>n<\/i> = 1031) and Florida (hurricane risk, <i>n<\/i> = 1010) with a total of 2,041 responses from U.S. adult participants. Results indicate that only self-efficacy and injunctive norms significantly and positively predict wildfire and hurricane disaster preparedness behaviors. The models explained a very large variance (68 to 86 percent) of the disaster preparedness behaviors. By identifying the motivating factors, the study provides guidance for effective government public relations. It is a duty and potential of government public relations to help at-risk publics realize the needs to take disaster preparedness behaviors.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This study investigates the role of the chief executive officer (CEO) as a key corporate social responsibility (CSR) communicator who may encourage consumers to participate in CSR programs. The presence of CEOs has been prominent even among the general public. However, few researchers have explored the influence of CEO’s characteristics on effective CSR communications with external stakeholders. Drawing upon the sense-making approach in CSR literature, this study proposes a model that demonstrates the way CEO’s ethical leadership and fit between CEO image and CSR initiatives are associated positively with consumers’ CSR engagement. As mediators of the relationship, CSR authenticity and consumer-company identification (CCI) were adopted. This study tested the proposed model through an online survey with participants recruited from MTurk (N=988). Theoretical and practical contributions of this study were discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: In the current engagement literature, many scholars operationalize engagement as the numbers of retweets, comments, and shares (e.g., Lovejoy, Waters, & Saxton, 2012; Men & Tsai, 2012, 2014, 2016). This paper suggests a path forward in re-conceptualizing engagement and tests the operationalization of engagement in the social movement context. Conceptually, the research clarifies the concept of three tiers of social movement engagement and shows that social media engagement cannot represent the whole picture of engagement. Operationally, the research set out measurements of three levels of social movement engagement and tested the social movement engagement model. Through testing the model, we found that online information engagement does not have a significant impact on the production of social capital bonding. The model tells the public relations practitioners that social movement organizations need to facilitate opportunities to increase members’ relational engagement because it enhances societal engagement and the production of social capital bonding.<br />\n","Abstract Body: ‘Horizontalism’ refers to the network structure and ethos of social movements striving to enact participatory democracy through consensus-based decision making and prefigurative politics.  Coined by Sitrin, the term sprang from the Argentinian rebellion in 2001, and has since been covered in the sociological literature on social movements. This article expands horizontalism by introducing the concept of “horizontal public relations (PR)”—a way of understanding how activists integrate their practices of public relations within these so-called new social movements.  Situated within sociology and critical-cultural understandings of social movements and public relations, horizontal PR is explicated using the case of the Occupy Wall Street Press Relations working group (PRG) in New York from 2011.  Building on previous work, this interpretative study uses new material from semi-structured interviews with PRG participants and related documents to highlight the story of how a performance artist and activist named Ketchup came to appear on the <i>Colbert Report<\/i>.  Although the activists’ practice of horizontal PR was arguably successful on the whole, the controversial, high profile media appearance suggests a potential pitfall with the organizational structure, serving as a caution to future activists who prioritize diversity and a point of interest for scholars of public relations.  The analysis applies contrasting arguments about social movement organization, considering race in public relations along the way. Furthermore, the case challenges binaries such as structured/unstructured, critical/functional, and professional/amateur.  Horizontal PR embraces the emancipatory possibilities of participatory democracy expressed through praxis.<br /> <br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> social movements, public relations, Occupy Wall Street, horizontalism, activism<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This paper examines the emergence of story-centered advocacy campaigns in an area where personal storytelling has traditionally been under-developed: disability rights. Historically, disability rights advocates have been wary of incorporating personal stories in their campaigns due to the frequent distortion of disability stories in news and by disability service organizations, chiefly for fundraising. Therefore, it is interesting to note the emergence of innovative story-centered disability campaigns in recent years. This raises important questions relevant not only for disability advocacy, but also for non-profit and grassroots organizations that advocate for other marginalized groups. Key questions revolve around the tension between the need for storytelling strategies to captivate the attention of key publics and impact public decision-making on one side, while simultaneously promoting narratives that accurately represent marginalized groups and counter widespread disempowering stereotypes on the other. These issues are explored through a comparative analysis of two story-centered disability advocacy campaigns from Australia (Every Australian Counts) and the United States (Little Lobbyists). This approach sheds light on the constraints and opportunities that influence the work of story-centered non-profits and grassroots groups at a time in which technology and participatory culture are becoming increasingly central to persuasive storytelling strategies.\n","Abstract Body: Different from other areas in public relations, the works on public segmentation are hard to find in political public relations. The current study suggested the new public segmentation based on the individuals’ perceived relationship with an individual politician: the level of political fandom. As an avid supporter, fans of politicians (political fans) very actively participate in diverse political activities. Because political fans are also highly engaged in public opinion, political fans are likely to be an important stakeholder of political organizations as well as politicians. However, little is known about who the fans of politicians are and how they participate in political organizations’ public relations campaigns. By using survey data from South Korea, this study segmented the public by using a political fandom scale and predicted the impacts of political fandom on individuals’ political participation and their political information seeking and sharing. Implications for public and stakeholder relations are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Key messages, or talking points, play a critical role in public relations communications, yet often go unstudied. This research fills a gap in the literature by examining 226 articles on the U.S. immigration policy of child detention between March 2017 to September 2019 that contain attributions to spokespeople. Using agenda-building and framing theory, it investigates how spokespeople used key messages to shape news coverage of the Trump Administration’s immigration policy. Findings show that government spokespeople are given greater access to shaping policy that are other groups, and their key messages have focused on the crime, detention and enforcement.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Purpose: This study examines which types of Twitter users public information officers interact with, the level of interaction, and how interactivity is associated with a locality’s population size and median age.<br />Theoretical approach: The normalization hypothesis suggests that social media tend not to change traditional engagement behavior, though demographic factors can have mitigating effects. This research explores the contours of normalization as it applies to public relations.<br />Methodology: A content analysis of PIO tweets in all Florida counties with an active Twitter account measured engagement with fellow PIOs, journalists, politicians, citizens, and private organizations. A four-level Twitter coding scheme, which is a more sophisticated gauge of interactivity than merely counting the presence of replies and retweets, measured engagement.<br />Key findings: PIOs rarely engage in back-and-forth conversations on Twitter, but when they do, it is primarily with citizens. Also, a county’s population size positively correlates with two-way communication.<br />Originality: The study adds to the concept of normalization and the four-level Twitter coding scheme within public relations.\n","Abstract Body: Paid media used to be the domain of marketing and advertising while public relations, on the other hand, spreaded its messages exclusively through unpaid media relations. Nowadays, new possibilities for distributing content blur this border. Sponsored social media posts, paid search engine keywords, and sponsored recommendations on news sites are just three examples for paid media that have entered the core activities of public relations. Little is known, however, about how this transformation reflects in daily communication practice. How have PR professionals adopted paid media? Which forms of paid media do they use to address their audiences? And how is the utilization of paid media shaped by their organizational and personal backgrounds? The proposed paper addresses this research gap and aims to make both theoretical and empirical contributions to the body of knowledge in PR research. It reflects conceptually on the introduction of paid communication channels in public relations, and delivers insights on the adoption of paid media in PR based on a cross-national quantitative study among 1,892 communication professionals in Europe.\n","Abstract Body: This work introduces <i>masspersonal communication<\/i>, interactions in which a personalized or directed message is communicated via a broadly accessible channel, and the associated masspersonal communication model, which allows for operationalization and empirical testing, to the PR literature. Originating from computer-mediated communication scholarship, masspersonal communication may more appropriately describe and facilitate evaluation of organizational efforts to engage via social media, where organizational social media increasingly serves as the nexus of multi-directional communication around that organization.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Social media has offered brands and organizations new opportunities to speak directly to consumers and stakeholders and to listen to their needs, opinions, and concerns more carefully. However, it has been claimed that practitioners fail to fully utilize the interactive and dialogic potential of social media, especially when it comes to young people. This study asks how young people perceive organizational listening by brands on social media. The young people studied represent the so-called Generation Z, people born between 1995 and 2010, who have emerged as a powerful force for change. Data for the study was obtained from an online survey conducted in Finland and the United Kingdom to study social media and its effects on young people. Respondents aged 15–24 were picked for further analysis and the sample size was 1,534 responses. The results show that age is positively associated with the perception of organizational listening. Organizational listening is also shown to be positively associated with trust toward brands, and perceived benefits from brands’ social media presence. The results further the understanding of organizational listening and dialogue on social media, the possible benefits of organizational listening, and Generation Z and their perceptions about brands. The results also show that by improving their competence in listening on social media, brands and organizations could benefit themselves and increase their trust, but they could also increase the perceived benefits of social media for young people, and therefore maybe even empower them.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores the case of Reese’s 2016 #Cupfusion campaign on social media, primarily on Facebook. Using qualitative methods, this study found that the innovative methods used changed the way Hershey thought about how Reese’s lovers thought about their products, and now serves as a model for using social media for promoting these type of consumer items in public relations campaigns.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Purpose of research and research gap: Organizations have adopted social media to communicate to publics about their collaboration relationships (representational network). Yet a comprehensive examination of what is communicated and the factors that influence the representational network is relatively scarce.<br />Theoretical approach and background: This study refers to the literature of issues management and Symbiotic Sustainability Model to examine the content and the antecedents of representational networks on social media.<br />Methodology/research questions: Based on the analysis of one-year Facebook data by 413 public organizations in Taiwan, this study identifies the issues in organizations’ representation of collaboration networks, what influences issues engagement, and the factors that influence the configuration of representational networks on Facebook.<br />Key findings: The results identified five issues and showed that organizations’ issues engagement on Facebook was influenced by jurisdictional level, geographic location, and Facebook activity. Organizations’ participation in representational networks was influenced by organizational and structural factors. Central organizations were more likely to report collaborating and sharing common collaborator types than local organizations. In addition to cross-sector partners, public organizations tended to collaborate with other government agencies. The networks also exhibited the pattern of centralization.<br />Practical implications: Findings of this study identify the ways organizations, particularly public organizations, can engage publics by paying attention to both content and configuration of collaboration networks communicated on social media.<br />Originality and innovation: Integrating automated topic modeling, panel analysis, and longitudinal network analysis, this study provides a process-based view of the mechanisms and disparities underlying organizations’ stakeholder communication on social media.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Social media technologies have forced public relations practitioners to adapt their practices to keep up with industry developments, with the growing phenomenon of social media influencers (SMIs) presenting new opportunities and new challenges for public relations professionals. Indeed, the profession’s rapid adoption of SMIs as part of their campaigns raises questions regarding their use and the extent to which it fits with normative models promoting genuine dialogue and responsible advocacy. This study explores this tension between the uses and potential misuses of SMIs by examining the practices and worldviews of senior practitioners at several public relations agencies in Sydney, Australia. It propose a three-part theoretical framework for understanding the influences SMIs are having for public relations practice, which builds on models of dialogic public relations, rhetorical arenas, and ecosystems perspectives. Ultimately, this study argues that the affordances provided by the emergence of SMIs are predisposing practitioners to covert public relations activities that lack transparency and are inconsistent with normative and ethical ideals of best practice.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores whether virtual influencer Lil Miquela is disrupting, or ’jamming’, the way influencer relations has been practiced. Miquela, is at the forefront of a new lineage of avatar influencers constructing data-driven, parasocial, emotional interactions between humans and digitally generated ‘characters’, a practice that, paraphrasing Stiphas (2015), is becoming “a profitable affair” (p. 395). This explains why we propose Miquela as an algorithmic <i>brand<\/i>, carefully customized by her creators and minders (<i>brud<\/i>, a digital LA company) to emotionally connect with specific publics – mainly Gen Z, millennials – built trust, and ultimately profit. Our research suggest that brands and followers alike are captivated by the idea of interacting with an AI celebrity. In the context of an algorithmic culture, where a war of digital narratives is everyday norm, Miquela has risen as an storyteller avatar, dabbling in Instagram videos, electronic pop music, partners with human influencers, promotes well-known brands, advocates for youth related causes, and also sells her own fashion line. The foregoing discussion raises our main question: Are algorithmic DGI character Miquela and her peers disrupting influencer relations, or creating a new kind of influencing practice altogether? To answer this question we draw on theories of algorithmic culture and branding, culture jamming, and influencer and parasocial relations. We also use a mixed method that includes digital media analytics and sentiment analysis, and a digital ethnography based on weekly critical observation and textual analysis, of two years of Miquela’s social media posts with emphasis on Instagram.<br />(Abstract: 246 words)<br />(Extended abstract word count: 1799 words)\n","Abstract Body: The present study incorporates Situational Theory of Publics (STP) and empowerment theory to understand how Cause-related Marketing (CrM) builds consumer-brand relationships. The results demonstrate that problem recognition and involvement recognition is positively related to empowerment, whereas constraint recognition is negatively related to empowerment. Further, three dimensions of empowerment (i.e., perceived meaningfulness, perceived competence, and perceived impact) positively influences brand relationship quality. Empowerment serves as an underlying psychological mechanism that explain the effects of STP on brand relationship quality, which offers theoretical and practical implications and also warrants future research attention.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The role of the PR industry in the disinformation debate has been largely overlooked, while an emphasis has been put on the responsibilities of platforms, media organisations and audiences to monitor content and eliminate fake news. In contrast, this paper argues that disinformation and fake news are well-established tools in PR work and are implicated in the current crisis. Drawing on an exploratory study of UK industry publications about fake news and disinformation, the paper shows that public relations has  addressed disinformation as a commercial opportunity and a platform for demonstrating professional legitimacy. Their narratives position professional practice ethical, trustworthy and true, while simultaneously ‘othering’ dubious practices and normalising ‘organised lying’. The paper concludes by arguing that the fight against disinformation must take seriously the impact of public relations, if it is to be effective.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores perceptions of trust in key stakeholders involved in communication on behalf of organizations.  Findings are considered at the professional, departmental and individual level as well as considering the trusted role of non-specialist communicators for organizations including internal and external spokespeople. Data was collected from an online survey of 2883 respondents from 46 countries across Europe to answer six core research questions identified from the literature in the field about trust in the communications profession. Key findings from the responses of the sample of professional communicators across Europe were that: antagonism between communication professionals and journalists remains; top executives are perceived to trust the department the most followed by journalists in second place.  The lowest trust is felt to be by the publics that use the communication channels and messages; gender trust differences were not confirmed; regarding those who communicate on behalf of the organization, then external experts such as professors and consultants are perceived to be the most trusted by the general public; communicators believe that building trust in the organization as an entity is more important than enhancing trust in the organization’s leaders; and finally individuals are more trusted than both the organization or department they represent and the communication profession more widely.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Purpose & research gap<\/i>: This paper identifies the ways in which public relations influences the production of popular culture and its role in social change. To date, scholarship has mostly explored the various ways in which public relations is represented in popular culture.<br /><br /><i>Theoretical approach and background<\/i>: Adopting a critical approach, this paper develops a cultural analysis of the double game public relations plays in popular culture spaces through the insertion of neoliberal values into everyday lives and the promotion of social critique and justice issues.<br /><br /><i>Key findings<\/i>: In order to reframe the debate, this paper explores popular culture’s potential for transgression and resistance. Precisely because popular culture is concerned with the everyday and the non-elite, and entangled with consumption and production, engaging with the intersection of popular culture and public relations allows an exploration of the role of public relations in terms of producing, extending, and contesting dominant narratives. That is, popular culture offers a creative, critical and transformative space for exploring transgression and resistance and therefore an important space for exploring power and the role of public relations in contemporary culture.<br /><br /><i>Originality and innovation<\/i>: Studying the relationship between popular culture and public relations will make a significant contribution to understanding how social and cultural practices take shape and the potential for transformation.\n","Abstract Body: In this article, we acknowledge the tensions and overlaps that have positioned public relations, journalism and social movement research as operating in silos or at odds -- arguably antagonistically -- with one another. In working to bridge the gap between subdisciplines, we put forth a heuristic of articulation as a complex and nuanced approach to the social and communicative issues at play. Recognizing historical tensions and commonalities, we argue that scholars can rearticulate how subdisciplines operate, laying out possible theoretical and empirical pathways for the future of communication research that are grounded in social change.\n","Abstract Body: This article purports that the organizational stigma perspective would be a vital starting point to pursue more realistic and comprehensive understanding on how publics evaluate organizations. Basic and interpretative content analysis are conducted to analyze discussion forum posts and media content related to Hong Kong real estate developers that suffer from structural and societal devaluation. Results reveal that deindividuating and discrediting content accusing developers of being unethical prevails. Developers as a whole are held largely and primarily, if not solely, accountable for a wide range of social problems that have no direct relation with developers on the surface. Individuating evaluation is in minority and mostly instrumental for investment in stock or property market.<br /><br />This article provides strong evidences supporting the presence of deindividuating evaluation when developers are assessed as a member of a stigmatized category, i.e. real estate industry in this study, rather than as individual organizations. They suffer from corresponding stereotyping labels. This questions the widely accepted premise that mainstream Public Relations literature rests upon as well as the corresponding inclined scholarly attention towards individuating positive evaluation of organizations. Practical implications, such as that on issue management, are also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: There are parallels, intersections, and contrasts between how theory and practice in the public relations and science communication literatures have evolved. Given the need for systematic evidence-based theory to inform communication practice in both contexts, and the need for critical inquiry into the values and power structures that define and reinforce theory and practice in these domains, this manuscript: (1) highlights three areas—the trend toward engagement and participation, the potential for issues management in science, and practitioner roles and training—to demonstrate unique and complementary areas of scholarly interest in public relations and science communication, and (2) argues for focused programmatic inquiry in the emerging subfield of science public relations. Perspectives are offered for how a science public relations research program might advance, including examples of scholarship from public relations, science communication, and political communication.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Purpose of Research: Social media provides an opportunistic space for professional sports teams to promote various Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, but little is known how message frames coupled with teams’ on-field performance and one’s loyalty to the team affect perceptions of CSR activities.<br />Theoretical Approach: Team identification, a construct of Social Identity Theory, served as a theoretical underpinning to understand how identification to team interacts with CSR message frames.<br />Methodology: An experiment was conducted to investigate self-identified fans of National Football League (NFL) teams and their response to fictitious CSR messages on Facebook.<br />Key Findings: This study offers three key findings. First, team identity positively influences CSR regardless of the frame used. Secondly, winning and losing does not affect highly identified fans’ desire to engage in a teams’ CSR activities, suggesting fans strongly identifying with a team are likely to exhibit loyalty to their team through support of a cause if it appears to be aligned with the goals of the team. Lastly, using CSR and framing as a guide, this study examined which types of social media posts are most effective for increasing positive social media engagement and encouraging cause-related behaviors such as donation giving and volunteerism. News frame did not have an impact on social media engagement.<br />Practical Implications: Results provide best-practice recommendations to sports organizations using social media to communicate activities to external stakeholders (i.e. fans) that will benefit the cause and increase positive social media engagement (i.e. likes, shares, comments) on behalf of the organization. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This research investigates the interplay of socially responsible consumption (SRC), skepticism toward corporate social responsibility (CSR), and crisis types in predicting consumers’ responses to CSR. A survey conducted with consumers in Singapore finds that consumers high on SRC and low on skepticism show more favorable attitudes toward CSR. A follow-up experiment indicates that the effects of SRC and skepticism on CSR responses are moderated by the presence of an organizational crisis and its types.\n","Abstract Body: Purpose: The purpose of the project is to understand how threats affect publics’ engagement on organizations’ CSR efforts. <br />Theoretical Approach and Methodology: Applying intergroup threat theory, the current project conducts two experiments to investigate the effects of both external threats to an organization’s social/political stance (Study I) and direct threats to group identity (Study II) on publics’ engagement on organizations’ CSR efforts. <br />Key findings: Key results suggest that threats are not likely to materialize into declined purchase intention. However, threats trigger groups to adopt an avoidance-based approach. They become less likely to engage the organization based on their values even when the organization supports their viewpoints, and further alienate organizations that do not show any sign of support. =<br />Practical implications: To make such CSR successful, corporations should identify their key publics’ agreement towards organizations’ stances. It is also recommended for organization’s communication managers to leverage the potential power of indifferent groups as they are easily activated by external threats and are more likely to support the organization once motivated. Finally, organizations are recommended to keep in mind that even though threats may not directly impact purchase, they should not expect the publics (even high-affinity groups) to show stronger commitment to the organization, as these groups are likely to shift towards an avoidance-based strategy when it comes to interacting with potential “at-risk” external entities. <br />Originality and innovation: Taking further steps, this research extends identity research to CSR communications, and focuses on how intergroup relations or interactions among publics themselves affect group interactions with an organization.\n","Abstract Body: This study aims to expand the current understanding of how CSR appeals and sources in brand-related messages activate different dimensions of persuasion knowledge and how they interplay in influencing consumers’ behavioral intentions in the context of Instagram.<br />We conducted an online experiment with a 3 (source: a brand vs. an influencer without sponsorship disclosure vs. an influencer with sponsorship disclosure) × 2 (CSR appeals: presence vs. absence) × 2 (product type: bottled water vs. sofa covers) mixed design.<br />The findings indicate that CSR appeals decreased consumers’ critical evaluations of advertising, such as attitudinal persuasion knowledge activation, and thereby increased purchase intentions. In addition, sponsorship disclosure raised consumers’ advertising recognition. The brand was less likely to trigger conceptual and attitudinal persuasion knowledge than the influencer.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Although there has been a recent increase in the research on sport scandals, there is still a lack of empirical based content analyses on the reporting of sport scandals. This paper fills that gap by analysing the extent to which sport scandals are a relevant subject in mass media and which content-related aspects und types of scandals are significant in terms of scandalization in sport. <br />Therefore, this paper offers a definition and typology for sport scandals. It indicates why sport scandals might have a fundamental share of overall scandal reporting today in comparison to other fields of society. The paper further emphasizes content-related aspects such as celebrity status, sport discipline and type of sport scandal. In the empirical portion, a quantitative content analysis of all reported scandals in three German newspapers over a period of one year is provided. The results show that scandals in sport are more frequent as compared to scandals in other fields of society and show certain characteristics. Implications of the findings for athletes, organizations, and society are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Building on the work of Wenner (2011) and Messner and Montez de Oca (2005), this study provides an updated critical stocktaking of the narrative tendencies in sport-related alcohol advertising on television. Set in contemporary understandings of a “crisis of masculinity” and in the political economy of the alcohol industry, this study anchors a critical reading of masculinity, the sporting context, and alcohol advertising in Wenner's (2007, 2013) \"\"dirt theory of narrative ethics.\"\" Drawing on a diverse sample of American television commercials since 2010, the analysis considers evolving and contradictory messaging in alcohol advertising narratives. They alternatively hail the male sports fan constituency through mocking and misandry, through playfully saluting the norms of “bro culture,” and through encouraging men to understand themselves as proud keepers of tradition. This analysis considers the ethical implications of how different commercial narrative strategies build brand affinities by staking disparate positions in contemporary cultural and political debates about the place of men and masculinity in contemporary society.\n","Abstract Body: With the continual progress of technology, sports audiences are able to conveniently purchase event tickets and experience vivid interactions through the internet. To understand this popular development, the current study integrated user experience (UX) and elaboration likelihood model (ELM) to examine users’ online National Basketball Association (NBA) ticket purchasing experiences among different systems and sought to recognize their preferable website design. Examining data from in-depth interviews, this study identified that users preferred direct and clear ticket selling interface with the simple purchasing process and interactive feature (i.e., 360° view of the venue seating) instead of a website with complicated verification and/or unclear section/price list. Moreover, individuals who browsed ticket selling websites were purposive customers. As a result, they would focus more on the central route of information (i.e., ticket related information) than the peripheral route of message (e.g., team introduction or other menu options). The findings and theoretical application are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Long time discrimination had contributed to the unimportance or even invisibility of female media practitioners in the process of information generation in the past (Finneman et al.,2019). While the feminist movement since the 1960s has improved their working conditions (Lucht & Batschelet,2019), those who work for sports programs, which have long been dominated by male audience and producer, were not benefited (Harris,2013). In China, a female anchor might have a chance to report sports news, but live shows and other sport-related programs are monopolized by male anchors, commentators and guest speakers (Dai,2016; Tian,2019).<br /> <br />Arguably, a large number of female anchors emerged in Chinese sports programs in recent years. They firstly appeared in the live broadcasts of football and basketball games on the Internet. Under the influence of market competition, female anchors also appeared in TV sports programs. Nonetheless, female anchors who successfully present themselves in sports programs still have to face the inherent discrimination and numerous difficulties.<br /> <br />Outside the studio, female anchors for sports programs seem to achieve greater success in social media. Via operating personal accounts, they become popular stars in the media such as Weibo, and yield a large number of fans and social influence. Images of female anchors shown in social media differ from that in sports programs, and the former images seem beneficial for them to attract fans and gain popularity.<br /> <br />With regard to the above phenomenon, this research attempts to figure out two questions:<br /> <br />1 What is the representation of the female anchors in the official platform and private social media, and what is the difference?<br /> <br />2 Why is there such a difference in representation?<br /> <br />This paper mainly constructs the theoretical framework from the following perspectives:<br /> <br />1 Feminist Perspective: From gender studies, it is believed that female has become the object of gaze in video media, and the representation of female anchors in sports programs is branded with a strong viewpoint of male. Being an object of male gaze, a female becomes a symbolic definition instead of a distinct individual. Therefore, by interpreting the representations changes of female anchors for sports programs on different social media from the perspective of male gaze and resistance of male gaze, it is argued that when the initiative of representations is possessed by the anchor or the others, the results of representations are different.<br /> <br />2 Media Perspective: The affordance of social media has brought changes to sports anchors. Social media provides a self-presentation platform, as well as fans, which empowers female anchors for sports programs to fight against gender inequality. The construction of their self-brands via social media is a subjective lens through which the differences of representations and their reasons can be speculated.<br /> <br />To answer the above research questions, this study adopted the following two research methods:<br /> <br />1 Text analysis: Text analysis is utilized mainly to answer the question of media and self-representation. It includes analyzing the text of female anchors in sports programs and that in social media. Two most influential TV football programs in China: <i>Total Soccer<\/i> and Tencent Sports' NBA Live Broadcast Program are chosen for text analysis because a great number of renown female anchors raised from these two programs. Meanwhile, the contents of personal Weibo written by some most influential female anchors for sports programs are also selected for textual analysis as comparisons.<br /> <br />2 In-depth interviews: The author undertook in-depth interviews with ten well-known female anchors who worked for Tencent Sports, PPTV (two largest sport webcast platforms in China) and CCTV 5 (the biggest TV channel for sport). Their social media fans are around one million. The interviews included the difficulties they faced from job hunting to daily work, the method they overcome the troubles, and the purpose and methods of operating personal Weibo.<br /> <br />While this research is still undergoing, three initial conclusions have been drawn:<br /> <br />1 The number of female anchors in Chinese sports programs has grown rapidly in recent years, but their images are similar. In terms of professionalism, female anchors are difficult to prop up programs independently. They often assume the role of questioner, transitioner, and promoter, but less professional work, like offering professional explanation and commentary. In accordance with such occupational role, their images are usually not professional or prudent. Instead, they are supposed to show a gentle, ignorant, cute femininity. Therefore, even although admitted into the studio, female anchors for sports programs are in a secondary position.<br /> <br />2 The images of female anchors for sports programs on private social media are different. By showing living conditions, personal opinions and ideas, their self-presentations are richer and solid compared with official images. Female anchors successfully establish their personal brands and acquire political initiative with the help of social media, and yield economic benefits via advertisement simultaneously. In the idol-fans relationship, female anchors are predominant. Such privilege accumulated from private social media may affect their work reversely, gaining initiative for job hunting and hopping. It is fair to argue that self-branding is helpful for female anchors for sports programs to resist the male gaze in working environments.<br /> <br />3 The establishment of the sports female anchor self-branding reflects the affordance of social media, that is, the possibility of dispelling male gaze in one medium through the other. However, female anchors fail to get rid of the inherent pressure of gender structure in the process of personal brand establishment. They still need to obtain the attention and admiration of male fans by showing their femininity. Such demonstration looks pressure-free, but the inner motivation remains unchanged: male gaze.<br /> <br />The rise of social media injected new elements into the gender research of anchors. The official media representation of female anchors for sports programs is comparable to an emerging object: the personal accounts in social media. On the one hand, this study makes the male gaze in the studio more evidence-based. On the other hand, self-branding provides female anchors for sports programs with a new way to resist male gaze, promoting equality and openness in the media industry.<br />\n","Abstract Body: One of the major sports stories to garner headlines in the past few years has been the effects of concussions on football players. None has elicited more headlines than a Boston University study released in June of 2017 that found that 117 out of 202 former football players were diagnosed with CTE, the degenerative brain disease which is likely caused by concussions. However, recent studies show that female athletes may suffer from more concussions. This study employed a qualitative discourse analysis through the lens of framing of how many stories appeared in online national newspapers and sports sites about female athletes and concussions in 2017 and also after the FIFA Women’s World Cup in 2020. In various longitudinal studies across multiple platforms, scholars have found that media coverage of female athletes has actually declined. It is also likely that reporting of health studies affecting them would mirror this as well.\n","Abstract Body: Does level of team identification—how well a person perceives themselves to be a fan of a team—mediate patterns of second screening Uses and Gratifications (U&Gs)? This paper will explore the extent to which one’s identification with a team alters motives for, and gratifications obtained from, second screening during broadcast sports events. Specifically, we will use a Qualtrics survey of mobile phone users in the Amazon Mechanical Turk subject pool (expected n = 400) to determine how second screening U&G patterns change at different levels of identification. In so doing, this research will explore a theoretically relevant mediator that may alter the boundaries of U&G in the second screening context by suggesting a critical user background characteristic (identification) changes overall U&G patterns.\n","Abstract Body: On July 25, 2014 controversial ESPN <i>First Take<\/i> host Stephen A. Smith delivered what many considered to be an offensive rant on the role women play in their involvement with domestic violence. Smith, who was addressing the NFL’s suspension of former Baltimore running back Ray Rice, stated, “what I’ve tried to employ the female members of my family, some of who you all met and talked to and what have you, is that again, and this what I've done all my life, let’s make sure we don’t do anything to provoke wrong actions,” (Chase, 2014). ESPN would later go on to suspend Smith for one week and he would apologize for his remarks. On September 8, 2014, TMZ released a previously unseen video of Rice hitting his wife Janay in a hotel elevator. The video shows that there was no provocation from Janay and that he acted violently under his own accord (TMZ, 2014). The images seen in the video sparked further reaction from the NFL and the Baltimore Ravens and Rice’s two-day suspension became indefinite as his contract was terminated (Belson, 2014).<br />The power of the video footage firmly turned public opinion against Rice, which eventually led to severe punishment from the NFL. Images have the power to cut through words by provoking more emotion and reaction, and in this case, we see how those in power attempt to reconfigure narratives of domestic violence that position women as instigators who should remain subservient to men. These rhetorical maneuvers are shattered once video evidence is disseminated to the public.<br />The question we have as scholars is how does the rhetoric in sports media change before and after video “evidence” becomes public information. For this study we analyze the discourse from sports journalists and media pundits from three separate cases where video evidence of an athlete committing an act of domestic violence against a woman surfaces and is disseminated publicly. The first case looks at discourse before and after the Ray Rice video, the second case focuses on Kareem Hunt, and the third looks at Joe Mixon, both of whom are also professional football players in the NFL. Together these three case studies provide some empirical insight that allows us to trace how rhetoric changes when images depicting acts of violence against women become public. In other words, we look at how rhetoric crafts narratives without evidence versus how rhetoric changes when images contradict or reaffirm previously stated discourse.<br />From a theoretical perspective, we rely on Barbara Welter’s (1966) concept of “true womanhood” and it how it helps shape rhetorical discourse in mainstream media about gender roles, as well as Judith Butler’s (1993) feminist framework of gender performance and subordination. We also interrogate literature from scholars who study how domestic violence is covered in the news media. Previous scholarship on sports rhetoric in the media highlights that the goal of domestic violence discourse is to position aggressors as masculine in order to maintain hegemonic masculinity (Chase, 2019). Another important theoretical foundation of this paper is John Durham Peters (2001) concept of witnessing, which deals with the impact that witnessing an event through the media can have on claims of truth and authenticity.<br />Across the three case studies we gathered 104 articles that make up the corpus for this research project. We separated articles out before and after video of the case became public. When possible, we also made sure to pair up the articles written by specific authors in order to denote the timeline of discourse produced before and after these videos became public. We used critical discourse analysis in order to analyze written text produced by men in sports media who chose to write about these events (Fairclough & Wodak, 1997), as well as the spoken words of television pundits and broadcasters. We also separate our findings into two distinct time periods: before witnessing and after witnessing. Within each of these two categories we came up with sub themes that emerged from our analysis of corpus.<br />Before witnessing the videos men in sports media often produced rhetorical narratives that position men as <i>defendants in the process of judgement, as inconvenienced by the controversy<\/i>, and <i>as victims of athletic inaction. <\/i>These narratives often positioned men as unworthy of scrutiny or judgement because they had yet to be subjected to the criminal process. Likewise, men were often seen as victims because they were letting down their team and teammates and their careers might be in jeopardy. Finally, men in sports media often expressed regret and sorrow that the athlete was inactive and unable to perform their duties on the field.<br />After witnessing, rhetorical narratives dramatically shifted in different directions. The findings suggest that those in sports media would often shift the blame from the victim to the perpetrator and/or the league in which he plays, frame the issue as an isolated incident and not a common occurrence in professional sports, try to backtrack on previous comments that may have placed blame on the victim, and lastly, discuss the possible penalties based on the perceived severity of the assault.<br />The findings suggest that images have the power to push back against narratives that attempt to relegate women to instigators of domestic violence and men as victims of circumstance. Interestingly, men would rarely address the prior narrative they attempted to push onto their audience and never addressed contradictions in opinions. Bearing witness to acts of domestic violence is more powerful when images are allowed to be witnessed by the mass public. People who are in positions of power and are afforded the capability to construct narratives lose this power when witnessing is turned into a communal and public activity.\n","Abstract Body: <br />From November 13, 2018 to April 7, 2019 professional wrestler Daniel Bryan maintained a grip on the prestigious WWE Championship. What made Bryan’s reign interesting is that he acquired it after returning from a three-year-long absence due to injuries suffered from concussions. What should have been the triumphant return of one of the most beloved (and cheered) baby-face wrestlers in history quickly turned into shock and horror when Bryan took a “villainous” turn. Bryan began to cut promos where he berated the audience for mass consumption, criticized baby boomers for their greed and boldly proclaimed he was the “planet’s champion.” Many of Bryan’s promos overtly attacked consumerism, unchecked capitalism and ranted about how the planet was dying. In one of the most bizarre promos, Bryan stood at a concession stand in a stadium hurling drinks “slurped down in this plastic cup, with a plastic straw, choking the earth that we live on.” All while receiving massive boos from the audience.<br />Daniel Bryan’s heel turn provides an interesting opportunity to analyze how leftist and progressive ideals where commodified by WWE and transformed into a television angle that presents these ideals as villainous and anti-American. The company has a long history of turning social movements into television angles for the purposes of commodification. In 2014 WWE presented the “Occupy Raw” movement that mimicked the Occupy Wall Street movement from years prior (Canella, 2016). In 2018, WWE received criticism for appropriating feminism and women's empowerment all while conducting business in Saudi Arabia that doesn’t allow their female performers to wrestle or participate in shows in that country (Totilo, 2018). <br />The purpose of this study is to analyze the discourse from sports media and pop-culture writers about Daniel Bryan’s character as well as the on-screen rhetoric from by Bryan himself. This is a case study of how WWE positioned Daniel Bryan as an anti-capitalist villain that they then exploited and commodified for their own gain. We then connect this case study to greater academic literature on portrayals of leftist politics in American pop-culture media. The findings from this study suggest that Bryan’s on-screen role that villainized progressive leftist politics continues a long and sustained pattern that has been historically present in American media and sports culture.<br />From a theoretical perspective we rely on Stuart Hall’s (1997) concept of representation and Budd’s (2001) critique of capitalism and sport. We also engage with marxist film theory that analyzes how radical leftism is often villainized in American literature and film (Murphy, 1991; Forsynth, 1997). Historically, leftism has often been presented in its most radical forms in television, film and comics. Fradley (2013) revealed how the character Bane in The Dark Knight Rises is the villain that the hyper-capitalist and tecno-neoliberal Batman character eventually defeats. Morgan (2006) argued that in sports, leftist ideals often clash with the more hierarchical and patriarchal morals that drive ideology in sports.<br />For our case study we analyzed 20 hours of WWE programming during Daniel Bryan’s run as champion, as well as 40 feature articles written about the character from both sports and pop culture writers. We used critical discourse analysis as suggested by Fairclough and Wodak (1997) in order to analyze the meaning making elements that emerged within text and Bryan’s promo speeches.<br />The findings suggested three overarching themes: leftist politics are a deviant and abnormal, capitalism and consumption is heroic, and that neoliberalism is the solution to radical leftism. <br />WWE’s capacity to present it’s form of “sport” as authentic and real also empowers the audience to participate directly in the storylines. In order for the viewer to buy into the notion that Daniel Bryan is the villain, the audience must “boo” him in order to establish his character as deviant. WWE effectively does this by having Daniel Bryan focus most of his rhetoric on attacking the fans and the audience, rather than direct his grievances towards his “boss” Vince McMahon. In fact, in the segment where Bryan attacks McMahon and baby-boomers, the audience actually ends up cheering Bryan. For that one insular moment Bryan becomes a hero of resistance towards his capitalist employer before the crowd turns on him again when he directs his verbal assault towards them.<br />In the lead up to Wrestlemania Daniel Bryan entered a feud with African wrestler Kofi Kingston. In this portion of Bryan’s reign he ended up aligning himself with McMahon in order to foil the baby-face hero Kingston in his pursuit for the WWE Championship. While Bryan still maintains that his cause is to fight for saving the planet, much of the rhetoric becomes coded with racist undertones that critiques Kingston’s “worth” as a human being. When Kingston finally wins the title at Wrestlemania WWE positions Kingston as someone who had finally “worked” his way to the top, rather than overcome system-racism, echoing much of the ideology present under neoliberalism.<br />WWE’s treatment of Bryan as anti-capitalist villain continues to reaffirm and misrepresent the goals of leftist movements. This misrepresentation has a long and sustained history that is present within much of American media and sports culture.\n","Abstract Body: For the last 11 years ESPN has published <i>The Body Issue<\/i> “in celebration of the athletic form” depicting athletes in nude and partially nude photographs (Christie, 2019). <i>The Body Issue<\/i> has featured hundreds of athletes from dozens of sports and has been both celebrated for its appreciation of the human form and criticized for its objectification of athletes. It has been a huge financial success for ESPN and was able to help revitalized a struggling <i>ESPN The Magazine<\/i>. Initially created to compete with <i>Sports Illustrated<\/i>’s Swimsuit Issue, <i>The Body Issue<\/i> capitalizes on the sexual curiosity of viewers while using a rhetorical framework of pseudo-scientific art appreciation. Each year’s issue attempted to replace concerns of sexual objectification with a rhetoric of empowerment, reaching its apotheosis in the final 2019 issue. In the era of #metoo and “woke culture,” (Edmondson, Edmonson & Perry, 2019) this study examines how the appropriation of the concept of empowerment for the selling of sexual fantasy has the potential to obscure the issues of social progress.<br />This study builds on the previous descriptive and illuminating research by extending how the overarching concept of empowerment extends normative aspects of beauty and sex. These are manifested in latent visual propositions and engaged in audience formation of an ideal white heteronormative readership. From a theoretical perspective we rely on a Marxist framework, including Antonio Gramsci’s (1971) concept of hegemony and Louis Althusser’s conception of ideological state apparatuses. We highlight race and gender at the heart of this capitalist critique and therefore rely on Judith Butler’s (1993) feminist framework and Omi and Winant’s (1994) racial formation theory.<br />Concerning the visual depictions of athletes inside and outside of sport contexts, Margaret Duncan’s (1990) study on depictions of athletes in the 1984 and 1988 Olympics revealed how patriarchal views and sexual difference manifested in visual features (pose, expression) as well as in context (size of image, caption). Kane’s (1996) meta-study revealed how scholarship had extended Duncan’s findings to describe homophobia in women’s coverage, ambivalent coverage, and using sexuality and objectification to trivialize the lives of women athletes. One similarity in visual depictions of men and women is sexual objectification, as Rohlinger (2002) found, men are routinely objectified based on heteronormative conceptions of sexuality. <br />            As the occurrence of this sexual objectification and gender stereotypes was examined in <i>Sports Illustrated<\/i> and <i>ESPN The Magazine <\/i>covers (Martin & McDonald, 2012; Frisby, 2017), non-sport magazines (Curry & Arriagada, 2000) and television coverage (Messner, Duncan, & Jensen, 1993) scholars also began looking at the implications and effects of objectification. In addition, the way in which women are depicted in sports media equates to a denial of power (Kane, 1996; Kim & Sagas, 2014) through underrepresentation (Lumpkin and Williams, 1991), and through the passive depiction of the female body (Martin & McDonald, 2012).<br />    Studies looking specifically at <i>The Body Issue<\/i> have focused on topics ranging from the sexual objectification of Paralympic athletes (Weaving & Samson, 2018) to the visualized framing of the athletes (Cranmer, Lancaster, & Harris, 2016). Hull, Smith and Schmittel (2015) conducted a descriptive analysis of the first five years of the issue, finding that athletes were more likely to be depicted in passive poses and more likely to be described in masculine terms. Some other studies have focused on attitudes about the athletes depicted in the issue and the ambivalence toward female athletes. Thus, this paper attempts to fill a void in the literature that addresses the discrepancy between the framing of the <i>Body Issue <\/i>as empowering for the athletes and the inherent objectification of them through the oversexualization of their bodies. <br />This study utilizes a multi-modal analysis to examine the images and included text (captions, pull-quotes, interviews, etc.) in the online digital compendium of ESPN’s <i>Body<\/i> <i>Issue<\/i>. More specifically, this paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of all of the ESPN <i>Body Issues<\/i> from 2009-2019, looking at all the photos of every athlete included (<i>N<\/i>=1,224) as well as any accompanying text, captions, or interview excerpts, as found on the ESPN online <i>Body Issue<\/i> database. That provides the foundation from which to build a critique based on both the photos and the rhetoric used to describe them. Highlighting the preferred readings of salient symbols of sexuality, athleticism, and gender in an intertextual context reveals the normative assumptions of American culture.<br />            The findings describe the ways in which empowerment is capitalized to extend ideal standards of beauty in men and women, use diversity (age, physical impairments, sexual orientation) as an inoculation to criticism, and exoticize minority athletes through sexualization. This study also examines how the preferred readings suggest an ideal white heterosexual audience, through the promotion of identifying with white male athletes through visual depictions of humor and personality. Ideology is often represented through media and is using empowerment as a vehicle to capitalize on the body as object. The modes of co-opting emancipatory rhetoric in contemporary discourse need to be illuminated and should be a location for resistance.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This article explores the social and political implications of Chinese fans’ online discursive practices around European football in order to enrich the understanding of how digital technology shapes this transnational fandom in reforming China. Drawing critically from the concept of “virtual public sphere”, I argue that football talks enabled by the affordances of discussion boards empower Chinese fans by offering them a site for political deliberations and engagement. My virtual ethnography on Hupu Forum reveals the ways in which online fan discussions about European football produce ideological reflections on the issues of race and sexuality which rarely occurs in other public spaces in China. I also discuss how this virtual public sphere for racial and sexuality equality is conditioned by the affordances of discussion boards and the textual specificity of European football and why these online deliberations are hard to turn to more substantial activism. <br />\n","Abstract Body: CrossFit is one of the fastest growing fitness programs in the world. Its staple characteristics of workout adaptability, and inclusive environment led to the development of adaptive CrossFit by a group of athletes with disabilities. Digital media not only contributed to the expansion of the of CrossFit, it’s shown to have an impact on exercise behavior and identity. This pilot study aims to learn about how a unique subgroup of athletes with disabilities, who are regularly exercising, use digital media. An in-depth interview was conducted with an adaptive CrossFit athlete learn about how the population uses digital media. Preliminary findings show that the private group chat app known as GroupMe was used by a group of adaptive CrossFitters from the same gym to support one another, aligning with the Social Support Behavior Code. Social identity on digital media platforms is also discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study interrogates the potential relationships between NFL fandom, fantasy football participation, and the fragmented state of NFL media consumption, and how they all contribute to the perception of the NFL’s brand. Implementing a national sample of 375 self-ascribed NFL fans, the study uncovers the degree to which one’s attachment to the NFL and one’s consumption of the NFL product across different media channels can affect branding outcomes related to the brand identity the NFL presents to its audience. Results revealed that both NFL fandom and fantasy football participation is a major driver of media consumption, with fandom affecting televisual and digital media consumption, while fantasy football participation affecting consumption of all forms of NFL media. In addition, while fandom affected the perception of the NFL’s image and one’s attitude towards the brand, fantasy football participation only affected one’s attitude towards the NFL brand. Finally, consumption of the NFL’s television product was the only form of media that impacted participants’ attitude towards the NFL brand.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper aims to investigate how the dominant types of government-led stakeholders engage in China’s sport nation branding on social media, and what the potential impact of this on the branding process of China through sports with specific reference to soccer.\n","Abstract Body: In August of 2019, Nike was publicly criticized for sponsorship policies that would reduce or even stop scheduled pay for pregnant athletes and new mothers. The athletic company’s sponsorship contracts penalized athletes during their pregnancy and enforced strict guidelines for performance expectations once they returned. The policy was so extreme that Phoebe Wright, a Nike sponsored runner, called getting pregnant “the kiss of death” for Nike’s athletes. Utilizing the hashtag #DreamMaternity, an athlete-led movement against Nike’s pregnancy policy emerged on social media. Athlete activists such as Allyson Felix, Phoebe Wright, Kara Groucher, and Alysia Montano used Twitter and Instagram to share their experiences. From these original posts, thousands of users responded. Through an open coding discourse analysis process of 1,500 tweets, six discourses emerged as dominant themes for discussion about Nike and motherhood.\n","Abstract Body: In an overall sports media complex that tends to diminish women athletes both in terms of visibility and depiction, sports mega-events often provide a more progressive glimpse of what gender equity could entail. This manuscript will advance an argument built on the notion that the constructs on which sports mega-events are built are uniquely advantageous for advancing gender equity in terms of visibility, yet less so on more troubling dialogue-oriented terrain. Using the Olympics and World Cup as exemplars, the case will be made that national identity becomes the central mechanism in which individuals advance heuristics of self-categorization theory, blunting many of the common tropes frequently utilized in other everyday sports media renderings. Discussions of the four elements of national identity will be juxtaposed with elements frequently found within entrenched masculine hegemony specifically within mediated sport renderings.\n","Abstract Body: Within the body of research on (online) sports betting, scholars have paid relatively scant attention to the role of media. As a response, this cross-sectional survey study pursues the development of a multidimensional in-play betting profile of sports gamblers consuming mediated live sports on a regular basis. In line with previous empirical research and grounded in online gambling ecology theory, the focus of this study is directed towards dispositional, gambling-specific/behavioral and sports media (text)-related factors.\n","Abstract Body: N/A - Submitting as an Extended Abstract\n","Abstract Body: This study describes how female youth club soccer players (N =28) use implicit theories about the nature of identity traits (i.e., entity or incremental mindset) to manage their identities when their effort is sanctioned by peers. An abductive process of data collection revealed that all participants had been labeled as a “try hard” (i.e., a person who is putting in too much effort) by their peers. This ascribed identity was used by participants’ peers to sanction their effort towards performances of excellence in athletics and academics. An iterative analysis reveals two strategies for negotiating this ascribed identity that reinforced an entity mindset (i.e., avoiding, and concealing effort), as well as three strategies that reinforced an incremental mindset (i.e., ignoring, rejecting, and embracing a “try hard” identity).\n","Abstract Body: After a 2018 Differences on Sex Development (DSD) policy from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) left South African middle-distance track runner and world-record holder Caster Semenya ineligible for the 2020 Olympic trials and other elite competitions, Twitter users turned to the social media platform to reflect on her treatment. Users vocalized support and opposition to Semenya, the IAAF, policies baring the athlete from participation, and other competitors. In doing so, they adopted intersectional language and themes that reflected the contemporary challenges of sex and gender identity. Through a critical discourse analysis adapted from Gee (2010) of over 4,000 #CasterSemenya tweets, this paper identifies six discourses adopted by Twitter users when reacting to IAAF’s DSD policies: information sharing, criticizing IAAF, criticizing Semenya, reflecting on Semenya’s ethnicity, supporting Semenya, and intersectional applications of gender, race, and sexuality. This paper provides insights into intersectionality in sports and regulations in international competition.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This article examines the effects of tragedy and achievement narratives in disability sports news features on the perceptions of people with disabilities. 127 undergraduates read one of 4 randomly assigned disability sports media features with different degrees of emphasis on tragedy and achievement. Participants rated their perceptions of people with disabilities in terms of warmth and competence. They also rated their perceptions of people with disabilities in regard to the supercrip narrative specifically. We found that when disability sports feature articles emphasize achievement, people with disabilities were perceived as more competent.  When the narrative emphasized high tragedy and low achievement, participants were more likely to endorse the supercrip stereotype for people with disabilities. Results contribute to literature on the representation of athletes with disabilities in the media and the representation of marginalized groups in general. Practical applications for adaptive sports reporters are discussed.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Rooted in the idea that sports fans are willing to pay a subscription fee for deep-dive, enterprise-based feature coverage in contrast to hometown newspapers, <i>The Athletic<\/i> began luring away top talent from legacy media outlets with the promise of a higher salary, perceived job security, and the ability to produce longer articles with less frequency. This poaching strategy left those in the industry with a general disdain toward <i>The Athletic<\/i>. However, not every sports reporter, columnist, or editor views <i>The Athletic<\/i> as a media disruptor. Indirectly, the loss of veteran talent at hometown newspapers has, thus, created opportunities for up-and-coming sports reporters to jumpstart their careers. Thus, to properly gauge differing views on <i>The Athletic,<\/i> and its inherent effect on journalism, in-depth qualitative interviews with newspaper sports editors and producers were performed. Though data have not yet been analyzed, an emergent thematic method will be used to define key themes related to <i>The Athletic’s<\/i> effect on hometown newspapers and the evolving dialogue of sports journalism in the digital age.\n","Abstract Body: A long legacy of media representations distort, stereotype, and ignore marginalized racial and ethnic groups. In particular, magazines and advertisements tend to feature light-skinned models and celebrities over dark-skinned individuals, even lightening dark skin with photo editing to achieve ideals of whiteness and lightness. This practice aligns with colorism, or the privileging of light skin tones for access to economic and social capital. We examined colorism in a particular genre of digital photography, online retail images, as a problem of the modality or visual truth-value of images. To study the modality of online retail photos, we compared the representation of model skin tones across still and video media modes and brands. Although modality is generally studied using visual semiotic and discourse analytic methodologies, we employed a novel method specifically tailored to our questions of interest: visual computational analysis. Using this method, we circumnavigate challenges of studying modality in digital imagery by quantitatively comparing the expression of modality markers. We found that analyzed retailers tended to favor light-skinned models on their websites and that model skin tones in product videos were significantly darker and less modulated than in product photos. Ultimately a new modality marker of consistency emerged from our findings on online retail photography. We detail this modality marker and suggest the potential for applying it and our novel analytic method to other digital texts.\n","Abstract Body: Color is applied to all marketing and visual communication activities in order to attract consumers and establish visual images or brand identity. Color can shape consumers’ perceptions toward the desired images or not and it helps a brand position effectively in the competitive market (Labrecque and Milne, 2012). Colors determine the quality of visual communication such as package design or logo and help branding in marketing communications such as advertising. However, colors are rarely applied by only one color to all kinds of marketing activities or subjects in communications such as on package design with typefaces’ colors and background colors or in advertising with headline copies and spokespersons. Colors are generally not applied by only one color to a product or brand, but mostly employed by color combinations with various appropriate colors, particularly for package designs. While the basic underline mechanisms of a color perception such as red or green have been relatively extensively studied, color schemes or a group (harmony) of colors are still not understood enough. Despite the importance of using appropriate colors and the frequent application of color combinations in marketing communication, little academic research has examined in which color scheme can shape perceptions and affective associations such as brand personality and emotional responses. The purpose of the current study is first to explore the effects of each distinct color scheme on brand personality and emotion and to understand the perceptions or affective associations that each color scheme generates. Specifically, the study attempted to prove that color enables consumers to evoke some emotions and can play an important role in the building of a particular brand personality. After exploring consumers’ perceptual responses to each color scheme, we can extend the further studies to examine the underlying mechanism in consumers’ responses for brand attitude, brand trust, price expectation, and brand choice. The findings and implications will be discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study conducts a laboratory experiment with factorial design to explore when an advertisement image communicated through three-dimensional creative expression, can consumers accurately and efficiently decode advertisement content and generate a positive attitude toward the advertisement and product being advertised?<br />   Findings further show that three-dimensional creative outdoor print advertisements exerts significant effect on consumers compared with two-dimensional outdoor print advertisements. In addition, the interaction between advertisement type and brand familiarity shows that only when the brand is familiar can three-dimensional creative outdoor print advertisements produce significant persuasion.\n","Abstracts: Instagram is an important application for art galleries, museums, and cultural institutions. For arts professionals it is a key tool for promotion, accessibility, participation, and the enhancing of the visitor experience. For arts educators it is an opportunity to influence the number of people who value the arts and seek lifelong learning through the aesthetic experience. Instagram also has pedagogical value in the gallery and is relevant for arts based learning programs. There is limited research about the use of Instagram by visitors to art galleries, museums, and cultural institutions and the role it plays in their social, spatial, and aesthetic experience. This study examined the use of Instagram by visitors to the Gerhard Richter exhibition at the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art (14 October 2017 – 4 February 2018). The research project found that the use of Instagram at the gallery engaged visitors in a manner that transcended the physical space, evolving and extending their aesthetic experience. It also found that Instagram acted as a tool of influence shaping the way visitors engaged with art. This finding is significant for arts educators seeking to engage students and the community through Instagram, centered on their experience of art.\n","Abstracts: Instagram has more than a billion users, yet despite being owned by Facebook remains a platform that’s vastly more popular with young people, and synonymous with the visual and cultural zeitgeist. However, compared to parent-company Facebook, or competitors such as Twitter, Instagram has been comparatively under-studied and under-researched. Moreover, as Facebook/Instagram have limited researcher access via their APIs, newer research approaches have had to emerge, some drawing on older qualitative approaches to understand and analyse Instagram media and interactions (from images and videos to comments, emoji, hashtags, stories, and more). The eight initial participants in this roundtable, from Australia, Canada, Finland and the United Kingdom, roundtable have pioneered specific research methods for approaching Instagram (across quantitative and qualitative fields), and our intention is to broaden the discussion moving beyond (just) methods to larger questions and ideas of engaging with Instagram as a visual social media icon on which larger social, cultural changes and questions are necessarily explored. <br /> <br />Contributions set the scene for a larger discussion, examining the invisible labour of the ‘Instagram Husband’ as a highly important but almost always hidden figure, particularly mythologized by online influencers. Broader conceptual questions are also raised in terms of how the Instagram platform reconfigures time from 24-hour Stories, looping Boomerangs, to temporality measured relative to when content was posted, with Instagram becoming the centre of its own time and space. Another contributor argues that Instagram users are always creating and fashioning each other, not just themselves, using the liminal figures of the unborn (via ultrasounds) and the recently deceased as case studies where Instagram users are most obviously creating other people in the feeds. Questions are raised as to why specific groups, such as Finnish influencer mothers, ardently claim Instagram is a purely positive space, while another contributor asks how the world of art is being reconfigured by the aesthetics and practices of being ‘insta-worthy’. Another contribution asks how to move beyond hashtags as the primary method of discovering collections of content. On a different note, the practices of commercial wedding photographers are examined to ask how weddings are being reimagined and renegotiated in an era of social media visuality. Finally, important questions are raised about the content that is not visualized and not allowed on Instagram at all, and how these moderation practices can be mapped against the ‘black box’ of Instagram’s algorithms.\n","Abstracts: While visual social media platforms such as Instagram are, by definition, about connecting and communication between multiple people, most discussions about Instagram practices presume that accounts, profiles and content are managed by individual users with the agency to make informed choices about their activities. However, Instagram photos and videos more often than not contain other people, and thus the sharing of visual material is often a form of co-creation where the Instagram user is often contributing and shaping another person or group’s online identity (or performance). This contribution outlines some of the larger provocations that occur when examining the way loves ones use Instagram to visualize the very young and the recently deceased. Indeed, even before birth, the sharing of the 12- or 20-week ultrasound photos and gender reveal parties often sees an Instagram identity begin to be shaped by parents before a child is even born. At the other end of life, mourning and funereal media often provide some of the last images and descriptions of a person’s life, something that can prove quite controversial on Instagram. Considering these two examples, this contribution argues that content creation could, and probably should, be considered visual co-creation, and Instagram should be seen as a platform on which users fashion each others identities as much as their own.\n","Abstracts: Temporal concerns are critical underpinnings for the presentation and experience of popular social media platforms. Understanding and transforming the temporal is key to the operation of these platforms, becoming a means for platforms to intervene in user activity. On Instagram, temporality plays out in different ways. Ostensibly describing in-the-moment, as-it-happens sharing and live documentation, the Insta- of Instagram has long been complicated by features of the platform and cultural practices and norms which encourage different types of participation and temporal framing. This contribution focuses on how Instagram time is presented and experienced by the platform and its users, from how content appears in non-linear algorithmic feeds to aesthetics that suggest, or explicitly callback to, older technologies and eras. These create temporal contestation as, for example, the implied permanence of the photo stream is contrasted with the ephemerality of Stories, where content usually lasts for only 24 hours, and the trapped seconds-long loops of Boomerangs. This temporal contestation apparent between different features of the platform also plays out in Instagram’s aesthetics, which include retro throwbacks of filters to the explicit visuals of Story filters reminiscent of VHS tape and physical film. Such platformed approaches then raise questions for researchers about Instagram’s temporality, how it is experienced by its users, and how it is repositioned and reframed by the platform’s own architecture, displays, and affordances.\n","Abstracts: The intersection of artsy, youthful, beautiful, and playful aesthetics alongside corporate branding have established certain normative modes of visuality on the globally popular social media platform Instagram. Adopting a post-phenomenological lens alongside an intersectional feminist critique of the platform, this paper presents the findings of working with six commercial wedding photographers on the west coast of Canada whose photographs are often shared for clients on social media. Via interviews, photo elicitation, and participant observation, this paper teases apart the multi-stable and manifold socio-technical forces that shape Instagram visuality or the visual sedimented ways of seeing shaped by Instagram and embodied and performed by image producers. This paper shows the habituation of these modes of seeing and argues that Instagram visuality is the result of various and complex intimate conversational negotiations between: discursive visual tropes (e.g. lighting, subject arrangement, and material symbols of union), material technological affordances (in-built filters, product tagging, and the grid layout of user pages), and sedimented discursive-affective “moods” (white material femininity and nature communion) that assemble to shape the normative depictions of west coast weddings.\n","Abstracts: The black box around the internal workings of Instagram makes it difficult for users to trust that their expression through content is moderated, or regulated, in ways that are free from arbitrariness. Against the particular backdrop of allegations that the platform is arbitrarily removing some images depicting women’s bodies, this research develops and applies a new methodology for empirical legal evaluation of content moderation in practice. Specifically, it uses innovative digital methods, in conjunction with content and legal document analyses, to identify how discrete inputs (i.e. images) into Instagram’s moderation processes produce certain outputs (i.e. whether an image is removed or not removed). Overall, across two case studies comprising 5,924 images of female forms in total, the methodology provides a range of useful empirical results. One main finding, for example, is that the odds of removal for an expressly prohibited image depicting a woman’s body is 16.75 times higher than for a man’s body. The results ultimately suggest that concerns around the risk of arbitrariness and bias on Instagram, and, indeed, ongoing distrust of the platform among users, might not be unfounded. However, without greater transparency regarding how Instagram sets, maintains and enforces rules around content, and monitors the performance of its moderators for potential bias, it is difficult to draw explicit conclusions about which party initiates content removal, in what ways and for what reasons. This limitation, among others raised by this methodology, underlines that many vital questions of trust in content moderation on Instagram remain unanswered.\n","Abstracts: This contribution reflects on several research projects that have had to negotiate Instagram’s depreciated API access, and its increasingly restrictive moderation practices limiting what the company sees as sensitive or harmful content. One project with Australian Red Cross was designed to access and analyse location data for posts engaging with humanitarian activity, in order to generate new insights and information about how to address humanitarian needs particular locations. The other examined users’ engagement with content actively engaged with the depression through hashtag use. Both cases required the adjustment of methods to sustain the research beyond the API restrictions and enable future work to continue to draw insights about the respective research problems. I discuss the development of an inclusive hashtag practices method, data collaborative co-research practices, and visual methods that can account for situational and contextual analysis through a targeted sampling and theory building approach.\n","Abstract Body: This project examines the various roles of mobile-clad citizen witnesses of crisis based on a critical discourse analysis of 140 tweets shared during the first week of Nicaragua’s current socio-political crisis. Employing a visual economy framework of crisis witnessing, the analysis showed that citizen witnesses enacted four distinguishable roles: that of verifier, watchdog, unifier, and dissenter. These findings extend current theorizations of the citizen camera-witness as a cosmopolitan political dissenter.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Intimacy is a key social goal and the fundamental basis of close social relationships. Today, social relationships and the interactions through which they are created and maintained are highly mediatized and visualized. This consequently also transforms how intimacy is played out. Based on a literature review and empirical findings on visual communication practices in close social relationships, this paper reflects on the conceptualization and different layers of visual intimacy. By discerning these different layers and by discussing the different roles visuals can have in intimacy practices, this paper aims to contribute to theoretically conceptualize visual intimacy for future research. Most importantly it is shown, that the content of visuals is not always essential for creating and maintaining intimacy. Practices of production, of sharing, as well as practices of talking about pictures and practices of seeing also need to be taken into account.\n","Abstracts: Video evidence, shot by citizen witnesses, has dramatically changed the conversation about police policy in the U.S.While the right to shoot video in public spaces has been largely settled as a First Amendment Right in the Appeals Courts, other rights involving video are less so. <br /> <br />Video from police body cameras, or \"\"badge cams,\"\" once lauded as a tool for citizen oversight, is not always made available to the public. Public records laws regarding video are unsettled and contested. Law enforcement agencies have tampered with cameras, altered and erased video and withheld evidence in order to protect state interests. Families pursuing information about the deaths of their loved ones must sometimes wait months, even years, for answers that could easily be provided with visual evidence. Visual records policies require careful consideration of the rights of defendants, victims, and the integrity of an investigation. Using a series of case studies, this presentation examines the struggle for control of visual narrative, and argues that for the public to truly have the \"\"right to know,\"\" consistent policies must be established for a \"\"right to see<i>.<\/i>\"\"<br />\n","Abstracts: The rapid adoption of body-worn cameras by police agencies in various countries promises to document many more police-public interactions than ever before. Pro-camera narratives are often based on the assumption that body-worn camera footage can provide more objective evidence of police-civilian interactions. Documenting these encounters is important, advocates argue, because it will provide better, more objective evidence useful to determining what actually happened (and who was to blame), especially when police engage in the use of physical (or deadly) force. Video evidence is often touted as providing a more objective view of real-life events than other forms of evidence, including eye-witness testimony. Indeed, the “new transparency encourages beliefs in images speaking for themselves, in cameras as mechanically objective witnesses, and in information as self-evident” (Brucato, 2015: 44), a view adopted by a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court in Scott v. Harris (550 U.S. 372 [2007]). <br /> <br />However, there is a growing body of research that suggests the presence of bias in the interpretation of video evidence in a variety of contexts (Granot et al. 2017), including with body-worn cameras (Culhane, Boman, and Schweitzer 2016) and videotaped police interrogations (e.g., Lassiter and Irvine 1986). Misconceptions about the objectivity and self-evident nature of video evidence have the potential to impact judges, juries, and other groups of individuals tasked with interpreting video evidence of crime or police (mis)conduct, and likely also impact public perceptions of policing within communities after instances of on-camera police-involved violence. <br /> <br />In my remarks, I will discuss early findings from an ongoing research project examining how police officers and community members understand, explain, and make judgements about the legitimacy of police use of force after viewing body-worn and other video footage of violent police-public interactions. <br /> <br /> <br />References:<br />Brucato B (2015) The New Transparency: Police Violence in the Context of Ubiquitous Surveillance. <i>Media and Communication<\/i> 3(3): 39–55.<br />Culhane SE, Boman JH, and Schweitzer K (2016) Public Perceptions of the Justifiability of Police Shootings: The Role of Body Cameras in a Pre- and Post-Ferguson Experiment. <i>Police Quarterly <\/i>19(3): 251–74.<br />Granot Y, Feigenson N, Balcetis E, and Tyler T (2017) In the Eyes of the Law: Perception Versus Reality in Appraisals of Video Evidence. <i>Psychology, Public Policy, and Law<\/i>.

Harris<\/i>, photography in <i>Sandifer v. United States Steel Corp<\/i>. and maps in <i>Carpenter v. United States<\/i>) to highlight problems surrounding the legal use of visual evidence. Through an analysis of trial arguments, judgments and the evidence itself, the paper argues that the doctrinal disregard for images at times when they are overused in practice is increasingly contributing to an environment where, in Errol Morris’s maxim, <i>believing is seeing<\/i>, even in court.<br /><br />Federal rules of evidence in the U.S. relegate images to the realm of demonstrative evidence, drawing analogies between distinct visual media like maps, diagrams, photography, film and video. In other words, all visual media predominantly play the role of illustrative evidence because legal doctrines see images as an appendage to words, typically requiring a witness to tether them into evidence. Yet, images penetrate into the law in much more complicated ways than what the doctrinal thinking permits, increasingly performing functions of substantive evidence as well. The resulting problems are twofold. First, by failing to account for the particularities of visual modes of information relay, even the highest U.S. Court sidelines what is at stake when, for example, video—which incorporates sound, picture and metadata—is assumed to operate under the same principles as diagrams and maps. Second, the tension between doctrine and practice in regards to visual evidence leaves judges and lawyers with what they perceive to be intuitive ways of seeing when assessing images, a dangerous move for an institution that seeks to distinguish between legal judgment and lay reasoning. By discussing these problems, the paper contends that what is seen in court is often determined by beliefs and feelings rather than understanding of how visuals work, helping replicate, and indeed justify, a wider politics of exclusion.\n","Abstract Body: Scores of members of the public were outraged by President Donald Trump’s zero-tolerance enforcement of the family separation policy on the U.S.-Mexico border in summer 2018. Part of the backlash was expressed through editorial cartoons, some of which deployed visual signifiers of the Holocaust to respond to the immigration crisis. Through the theoretical lens of collective memory, this study employs visual rhetorical analysis to demonstrate how these selected cartoons strategically mobilized one trauma from the past to play memory games with a contemporary audience. The study shows how, through the use of visual analogy and hyperbole, the cartoons represented the family separation policy as a second Holocaust, portraying the enforcement as equally repugnant and morally wrong. Through the deliberate weaponization of the past, the drawings reframed the border situation from what the president saw as chaos caused by undocumented immigrants to a crisis in presidential leadership and abuse of power, becoming, in effect, tools of resistance.\n","Abstract Body: Scores of members of the public were outraged by President Donald Trump’s zero-tolerance enforcement of the family separation policy on the U.S.-Mexico border in summer 2018.

This project expands this tradition by introducing the study of political cartoons to the study of visual communication and war. The study provides a comparative visual analysis of the political cartoons depicting the October 6, 1973 War published during the month of October of the years 2011, 2012, and 2013 in the Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram. It contrasts the visual tropes of political cartoons published during the Egyptian Revolution with their counterparts which were published as the war unfolded to identify the political uses of visual representations of war in cartoons during times of internal and external conflict. The article further identifies important qualitative changes in war illustration and commemoration, especially with respect to broader shifts and realignments of the political system.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The terrorist attacks and departure of foreign fighters have created a hasty security approach towards radicalization in many countries just as in Belgium, the country under scrutiny in this paper. The implemented policies impact the community by imposing a dominant security frame. In this paper, researchers engage in conversations with members of the ‘suspect community’, i.e. young people with a migration background in Molenbeek, Verviers, and Antwerp. Cartoon elicitation was used in in-depth interviews and the focus-groups to gain insight in their experiences with the dominant framing of radicalization, as well as to reconstruct how they deal with the sensitive topic. Conversations on a sensitive topic pose methodological and ethical challenges. The results demonstrate that cartoon elicitation is a valuable facilitator in interviews and focus groups to overcome these challenges as well as offering a tool to make the conversations more detailed and focused on the participant’s lifeworld.<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan and initiated a 15-foot tsunami that ravaged the coast, killed over 15,000 people, and triggered a level 7 nuclear disaster. The world, and residents of Fukushima in particular, were inundated with media photographs that painted a dire picture. Since then, aid provided to the community has focused on structural recovery, while indirect socio-psychological recoveries have been overlooked. As emotionally triggering photographs have been established as a potential barrier to recovery from trauma, there is a need to better understand the impact of those initial media photographs on the socio-psychological recovery of disaster survivors. The purpose of the present study was to address this gap and examine the kinds of photographs residents of Fukushima found impactful during the disaster time and affective responses they had to them. Drawing from the affective circumplex model (Russel, 1980) and photo elicitation interviews (Collier, 1957), a novel qualitative approach was used to involve 12 participants in exercises that included discussion, in-depth thought processes, and reporting affective reactions when viewing the photographs. Results indicated that while a majority of participants experienced a shift from strong negative to more neutral or positive emotions viewing the photographs six years following the event, the negative impact of these photographs and media portrayal of the disaster influences them to this day. By processing these photographs in a small group setting, these Fukushima residents reported feelings of acceptance and reflected on the importance of remembering what happened. Together, these findings support the impact of photographs on disaster recovery and suggest that more work to promote the socio-psychological recovery of disaster survivors must be done, even once structural recovery has been achieved.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Social upheavals in 20<sup>th<\/sup> century China have profoundly impacted individual lives and left traumatic marks to the society. The public discussion on certain movements, such as the Cultural Revolution, remains taboo till today under the state censorship, yet the traumatic memories were never forgotten. Chen Kaige’s Film <i>Farewell My Concubine<\/i> is one of the very few political sensitive visual productions that incisively recall and discuss these memories in public. This paper focuses on the film’s use of visual language to analyze the “siting” of memory. More specifically, this paper interrogates how slogan banners, which hint the changing of regimes, in a Peking Opera theatre that serves as a public place of assembly temporally and spatially situate the film and recall and form a traumatic past for contemporary audiences.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Policing worldwide relies on public relations to maintain social authority, and visual communication has historically been part of such efforts. This project examines the impact of digital media production on the visual dimensions of police public relations, focusing on an effort to humanize law enforcement in the U.S. with the 2018 “lip sync challenge.” Using multi-modal discourse analyses and the Stuart Hall’s typology of Dominant, Negotiated and Oppositional readings, this paper argues that the highly popular lip sync videos presented an ideological display unlikely to repair relationships with communities most estranged with American policing. A close reading of this viral phenomenon provides insight into the impact of digital media on police public relations.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Image macros have become a popular method to transform information through the Internet. They are also used for propaganda purposes to motivate participates and spread ideologies in related social movements. Especially, from 2016, Chinese netizens began to take advantage of the image macros to act as a weapon to flood and spam social media accounts overseas (mainly on Facebook). Taking the Virgin Atlantic incident as an example, this study describes the characteristics of image macros in the incident and discusses the features of Internet memes (i.e., successful image macros). This study found first of all, although the online collective movement was well organized, there is little contingency or pertinence in their image macros. then, most Chinese citizens in this movement were more concerned with expressing their feelings rather than making appeals. Finally, successful image macros are predominately originals with specific expressions and directly related ideology (moralism). This study’s insights on creating efficient Internet memes might be useful for the initiation of successful online social movements.\n","Abstract Body: “Danmu” is a commenting system in which viewers can post their comments directly on top of the video. These Danmu comments are projected directly on the screen. They float horizontally through the video and overlay the original content. As the video plays, viewers read the comments asserted by other viewers while watching the video simultaneously. Through an integrated theoretical and methodological approach inspired by actor-network theory, platform studies and visual culture, this study analyzes the Danmu commenting system on the Chinese video streaming site Youku. It is revealed that the technological platform features of Danmu challenge existing boundaries of traditional comment section. As a result, temporal and spatial reconfigurations of Danmu comments lead to new forms of audience participation. By tracing the actor-network in Danmu participation, it unveils the role of the nation state within the interruptive participation. This study puts forward the idea of an interactive, interruptive, and multi-layered “interrupted narrative.” It suggests that there is constantly shifting power dynamics among content, audience, media technology and nation state.<br /><br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> Danmu, participatory culture, online commenting, screen culture, interactivity\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study will provide a preliminary report of veil/hijab representation in GIFs, a modern social media tool of communication. It bridges a gap in visual communication research by conducting an integrative -textual and visual- framing analysis of 500 GIFs that used the hashtag #Hijab, to unravel the frames and stereotypes of veiled women in such online visuals. Hijabi Muslim women have been visually represented in media in overgeneralized stereotyped ways, being shown as either oppressed and subservient to others with no individual opinions, or as liberated progressives who resist western hegemony (Khan & Zahra, 2015). The research timeframe comes right after the two terrorist attacks on Muslim mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, that occurred on 15 March 2019, where an extremist Australian gunman killed 50 people and injured another 50 in the first ever livestreamed shooting video on Facebook (BBC, 2019). Utilizing a visual analysis dual-modality technique, of both textual and visual elements, and through conducting a quantitative content analysis of the most viral hijab GIFs in March 2019, the study will contribute to the growing literature of GIFs, and their representation of Muslim women and their body coverage “hijab”. It, therefore, will allow for a deeper understanding of GIFs’ usage, the frames they used in portraying hijab, and their stereotypical effects on the image of contemporary veil and veiled women on digital media, specifically social media platforms.\n","Abstract Body: This interdisciplinary study examines Chinese photographer Li Zhensheng's self-portraits made between 1958 and 1982 from an art-historical and cultural studies perspective. It situates Li’s self-reflective images within the context of the history of Chinese art and photography. It examines how they respond to Li’s personal encounters and societal shifts during a fervent and turbulent time in China’s recent past. It explores how power relations and politically sanctioned notions of identity are inscribed, negotiated and challenged in these images. It argues that Li used this artistic expression as a hammer to chip away the sacred wall of collectivism and articulate his individual subjectivity amidst a sea of revolutionary zeal. It suggests that these self-portraits constitute a critical juncture that foreshadowed a humanistic and subjective turn in the subsequent decades in the history of Chinese art and photography.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Poster-work from diverse feminist groups throughout South Asia preserves a vibrant and ongoing history of grassroots activism. This political communication strategy often addresses issues related to sexual violence, female infanticide, religious violence, as well as legal, educational and economic inequities. Taken together, these posters provide a complex narrative about women’s protest and offer unique insight into women’s activism in South Asia. They are powerful reminders of local and national struggles for justice, provoking reflection, deepening compassion and commitment, stirring outrage, evoking humor, and encouraging action. This paper explores a collaborative research project undertaken by scholars at the University of Wisconsin Madison, MICA, and two grassroots feminist groups in Gujarat, India --<i>Olakh<\/i> and <i>Sahiyar<\/i> in Gujarat, India. The project aimed to make accessible rare collections of feminist posters through developing a digital archive at the UW-Madison with open access for all (see https://uwdc.library.wisc.edu/collections/GenderStudies/).  Drawing from the field communication studies – specifically rhetoric, philosophy and visual studies - we offer analyses of the posters in this collaborative digital archive.  In doing so, we focus on a select portion of this unique collection, taking into account key audiences, themes, exigencies, and political contexts. We pay particular attention to how these political posters appeal to diverse intersections of people and often provide an effective way of addressing pressing community problems, as well as making claims for social justice and human rights. Finally, we suggest that even in a digital age, women in grassroots feminist organizations will continue to rely heavily upon poster-work because it is an economically feasible and socially familiar mode of progressive political communication. This is especially true for those who have not always had equal voices in the public sphere or visibility in mainstream documents.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Drawing upon Foucauldian, postcolonial, and feminist film theories of discourse, visualities, and power, I offer a critical entrance point for an analysis of the dominant codes and conventions of climate photography and documentary film through the introduction of a theory of the \"\"Anthropocene gaze\"\". My theoretical intervention centralizes around the problematics of climate photography and documentary film that effectively erase the disparities of impact and histories of imperialism at the crux of climate change. This erasure, in turn, obstructs policy responses that are needed to address inequities of power. A deeper contextualization of climate change is urgently required through a more diverse repertoire of frontline images taken by a more diverse cohort of photographers, including women and Indigenous publics. Instead of abstract aesthetics created through the lens of drones flying high above scenes of devastation below, on-the-ground perspectives and experiences offer a better understanding of the disparities and particularities of climate violence.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Viewing bathtub Madonnas constructed by Italian Americans in the early and mid-twentieth century as a form of vernacular media, this paper considers their role in the production of knowledge, the representation of identities and the transmission of history. It discusses past constructions of “race” and ethnicity pertaining to Italians while examining the geographical translations and evolving meanings of these visual media forms within the changing cultural and socio-economic contexts of modernity and globalization. While most previous research on Italian-American religious yard statuary analyzed them as expressions of faith and cultural identity within homogeneous Italo-American communities, this study reveals that they are also symbols of home ownership and long-term rootedness in a physical place. The paper argues that today bathtub Madonnas are repositories of the past, invoking nostalgia in a neighborhood that is rapidly changing due to new migration patterns, gentrification, and transformations in the US urban real estate market.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: This study employs a content analysis of 20 YouTube videos to test engagement factors using the media system dependency theory.

Results show that speech videos had more views, comments, and dislikes, while non-speech primitive videos had more likes but fewer views, comments, and dislikes. Both video types had appreciation, excited/curious, and advice/suggestion as the most prominent sentiment frames, although there are differences between them. The findings add to the theorization of media dependence theory in an interactive media environment.<br />\n","Abstracts: New camera technologies for everyday use are celebrated as granting visibility to the disenfranchised, as a means of connecting intimately over a distance, and as a way to broaden narrower modes of representation. At the same time, they are repeatedly met with unease and discomfort, because they seem to intrude on our privacy and call into question established patterns of social interaction. Visibility, considered essential for making of meaningful connections, continues to be discussed also as a trap.<br />This presentation explores ways in which mobile cameras, intended for everyday use, are provided with situated attachment suggestions, which influence how they get perceived and further used. By focusing on empirical case studies done among camera developers and users, the talk reveals how these suggested couplings tend to focus on specific body parts that are socially stratified. The socially stratified bodies, in turn, become inscribed in the material characteristics of the devices developed, in a pattern that influences societal power relations. This has important implications once these devices enter use settings very different from those initially intended or envisioned.<br />The presentation draws particular attention to the ways in which developers of early mobile camera phones searched for feasible use cases, and the manner in which today’s mobile camera use is growing increasingly entwined with efforts to automate detection, identification, and authentication, especially when coupled to situations of gatekeeping, such as automated boarding at airports. The analysis suggests that mobile photography has become a core experimental site for negotiating emotionally intimate connections, privileged access, and practices of monitoring identity and behavior, in ways that couple visual intimacy and surveillance while switching between corporeal and telecopresences.<br />\n",null,"Abstracts: The ubiquity of networked, increasingly mobile visual technologies has fundamentally altered how the visibility of individuals can be created, shaped and used. Visual technologies and visual communication are particularly efficient to depict places or people and their particular personal bodily and facial features in great detail. This makes them specifically valuable resources for intimacy, which is often described as a key social goal and the fundament of close social relationships. Images help maintaining close interpersonal relationships and emotional bonds over geographical distances by creating a sense of mediated co-presence, authenticity and affective proximity. Concurrently, the saturation of public and private spaces with visual technologies and images also enables new forms of surveillance capacities, of appropriation of personal information and social control, not only by state authorities and commercial actors, but also among peers, family members or partners. Here, images and visual technologies can be used to remotely track people and to provide evidence for their practices and social interactions. So far, concepts of intimacy and surveillance have mostly been discussed in separate fields of research or even as opposing concepts. Only few recent studies have started to attend to the complex intersections of surveillance and intimacy practices. Importantly, these studies have pointed to the increasingly diverse forms and social meanings of surveillance. Moreover, they have shown interplays of “doing intimacy” and surveillance in shaping care and building trust in families or partnerships. Yet, the particular roles visual technologies and images can have in these intersections remain a blind spot. This paper addresses these research gaps in a twofold way. First, as an introduction to this panel, the paper provides a theoretical discussion of the conceptual entanglements of intimacy and surveillance. Therefore, it reflects on the diverse layers and the overlaps of the concepts based on the review of literature from the fields of interpersonal communication, sociology, psychology, online communication and surveillance studies. Second, it focuses on the different roles visual technologies and practices of producing and sharing visual contents can have in these intersections of intimacy and surveillance.\n",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Abstract Body: In the last ten years, many canonical findings in the social sciences have shown to be unreliable.<br />This so-called replication crisis has spurred calls for open science practices, which aim to<br />increase the reproducibility, replicability, and generalizability of findings. Communication<br />research is subject to many of the same challenges that have caused low replicability in other<br />fields. As a result, we propose an agenda for adopting open science practices in Communication<br />research, which includes the following seven points: (1) publish materials, data, and code; (2)<br />preregister studies and submit registered reports; (3) conduct replications; (4) collaborate; (5)<br />foster open science skills; (6) implement Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP)<br />Guidelines; and (7) incentivize open science practices. While in our agenda we focus mostly on<br />quantitative research, we also reflect on open science practices relevant to qualitative research.<br />We conclude by discussing potential objections and concerns to open science practices.\n","Abstracts: Social media and internet data create unprecedented ways to study everyday life and to predict behaviour. This presentation will focus on how data is used in developing and training machine learning models to show one of the key limitations of data-driven open science in the data-driven era: namely, the power imbalance between platform companies and between social scientists. Three key conflicts will be discussed: litigiousness around intellectual property, lack of transparency in common training data sets, and the near-impossibility of reproducibility in many models and systems because of their contextual specificity. I argue that a new social contract for open science is needed so that social science insights can inform the development of algorithmic ways of knowing. Without solving the current open science crisis, society will have difficulty ensuring the fairness, accountability, accuracy and contestability of data-driven ways of knowing and policy makers will lack adequate data about public behaviour.\n","Abstracts: Through three case studies drawn from the ongoing work of the Center for Culture-centered Approach to Research and Evaluation (CARE) with subaltern communities at the margins of neoliberal knowledge production, I will explore the role of building communicative infrastructures for knowledge production at the subaltern margins. To challenge cognitive epistemicide, the active erasure of subaltern communities from spaces of knowledge production, often through racist articulations and at other times through co-option, I will turn to the concept of communicative equality as the basis for radical transformations in imagining socially just ecosystems, food generation systems, and spaces for health and wellbeing. Critically interrogating the role of power in colonizing frameworks of indigenous engagement, I will explore the concept of communicative sovereignty, the ownership of communicative infrastructures by subaltern communities as the basis for making knowledge claims and co-creating transformative practices.\n","Abstracts: Feminist, crip, anti-oppressive, and critical design approaches share a commitment to redressing habituated research practices that embrace hierarchal structures, position experts against “users”, and render research findings biased toward the scientist and the apparatus. This presentation draws on my research projects with scientists, older adults with dementia, and community-based activist groups, each seeking to craft radically ethical approaches to collaboration. Methods and strategies will be explored that tackle entrenched science research habits that: assume expert researchers possess (and should produce) knowledge; employ strategies that fail to engage stakeholders in the problem and research design; and privilege text-based productions over multimodal or oral traditions.  The presentation includes a discussion of how to hybridize methods, with feminist, anti-oppressive, and crip theory and emotional and speculative design approaches, and reports participants’ notes regarding the value in reframing how we do collaborative science research.<br />\n","Abstracts: A recent dominant discourse postulates that there is a growing methodological crisis among studies published across various disciplines suggesting too much of it is unreliable because many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate or reproduce. However, for those of us who use qualitative methods—historical, ethnographic, in-depth interviews, or, worst of all, textual and semiotic analysis—we have constantly had our work questioned along these lines. The charges include whether our work is verifiable, generalizable, reliable and, of course, predictive. In this presentation I will present a strong defense of two of these methods, historical and textual analysis, and note what claims can be made using them that are indeed verifiable, reliable and, yes, even predictive of effects.\n","Abstracts: Using the lens of qualitative methodology and the sociology of science, this presentation critically examines some of the key issues regarding replicability crisis in social science research. This talk identifies key limitations of these debates and argues they largely do not acknowledge the diversity of epistemological and methodological approaches within social sciences and communication studies more specifically. I instead offer various methods and tools for enhancing the legitimacy and transparency of communication research based on the interpretive social sciences.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Heeding the call of open science to improve transparency in the production and distribution of scholarly expertise, we focus on the comprehensibility of knowledge to wider audiences. A key step involves pursuing clearer definitions of foundational concepts. Definitions of two foundational terms - communication and information, and the imprecision in their traditional use are discussed. Clearer definitions can build conceptual links with other disciplines and make our scholarship more transparent to a wider audience.\n","Abstract Body: Chatbots are gaining increased importance in communication research and practice, enabled by recent advances in computational techniques, yet communication scholars are yet to fully explore the implications of these agents as <i>data collection engines<\/i>. They generate and collect a wide variety of data in their interactions with individuals in order to function, raising important questions regarding privacy and ultimately to dilemmas that need to be reconciled with an open science - and especially open data - paradigm. This study contributes to this discussion by providing an overview of how chatbots function as data collection engines and, more specifically, by reviewing the dilemmas that emerge when reconciling the individual-level data (often generated without the assumption of anonymity) with the open science paradigm in general and, more specifically, with open data sharing practices.\n","Abstract Body: Sharing data, analytic code, and research materials is a crucial part of <i>transparent and open science<\/i> (Klein et al., 2018; Miguel et al., 2014; Nosek et al., 2015). Open science improves the reproducibility and robustness of scientific findings by allowing other scholars to inspect and verify published results (Klein et al., 2018). Moreover, sharing data can improve the efficiency of science by allowing greater re-use and more collaboration and specialization (van Atteveldt, Strycharz, Trilling, & Welbers, 2019).<br /><br />The goals of open science are not controversial. Many scholars, however, do not publish data and code in a usable format together with the publication, either because the data cannot be shared due to copyright, privacy, or other regulatory barriers; or because it is simply more time-consuming (and more risky) to properly document and share our work, and the current academic incentive structure does not reward this work.<br /><br />This paper describes a standardized <i>research compendium<\/i>. In doing so, we offer a  structure and implementation that is designed to remedy both problems. By standardizing the folder structure and some light script metadata, this structure can offer sufficient benefits to nudge people to immediately work in this format from the start of a project. Moreover, by explicitly dealing with “sensitive” data (e.g. any data that cannot be shared), this structure can offer most of these benefits even if not all data can be openly shared.\n",null,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Abstracts: Rationale for Roundtable titled Open Access and the Field of Communication: The Struggle is Real:<br /><br />Open access is perhaps the most obvious part of the grander theme of open science facing ICA. This roundtable conversation takes up the issue of open access at an opportune time for the association, just as ICA is formally considering how to engage with a more robust pursuit of open access for our own journals and to link up with open access projects across academe. This roundtable will present for its audience a diverse and contested range of ideas related to open access. This diversity takes many forms. The roundtable participants are diverse in terms of their contacts with open access, geographic location, editorial experience, stage in their career, and intellectual affiliations.. The ensuing conversation—which will be guided by a well-composed set of questions posed to each participant well before the conference—will thus stage some of the important disagreements at work in the essential issues related to open access, including questions such as: Who will pay for open access? How do we create a transition from where we are now to open access? When has open access been rolled back to a paywall? How should academic associations like ICA relate to open access, especially given their financial pressures?<br /><br />Because we are communication scholars, scholarly communication is--or should be--a major area of research activity. This roundtable will interest those who study media industries, organizational communication, communication and technology, and much more. At the heart of all the questions we ask about open access in academe, one can find questions about the media at work. The session will make clear the connection between communication study and contemporary issues in open access.<br /><br />It is important to emphasize that the participants in this roundtable will at all times seek to avoid generalities. The value of this roundtable will derive from its careful and deliberate focus on the kinds of issues that often trip up those who have not spoken with publishers or other claims-holders about open access. This will, perforce, require that discussants address the oft-awkward concerns related to the financial and legal issues that pertain directly to all open access conversations. The discussants will directly address longstanding and frustrating questions about how to pay for open access, how to handle licensing for open access, and how to integrate open access into the interests of a scholarly association like ICA.<br /><br />Because open access is such a volatile and quickly-developing topic, it is likely that some of the live issues will emerge in the lead-up to the session itself. This will require a certain deftness from the discussants, who will be prepared to address the ground-level questions in logistics that will enable us all to develop a better grasp of the viability of issues around open access as ICA moves to embrace its principles.\n",null,null,"Abstracts: This paper traces how bots, algorithms, sensors, journalists, and geoscientists collectively create civic data that, in turn, structure public interpretations of events. Specifically, we examine how humans and non-humans inextricably intertwine data to create shared sense of timeliness, relevance, and consequence (Marres, 2012; Dewey, 1954). We argue that such data-driven, event-making publics emerge from seemingly uncontroversial groupings—geoscientists, journalists, algorithmic processes, mediated audiences—that collectively decide whether an event has happened, and how that event matters (Finn, 2018). Drawing on fieldwork—interviews, infrastructural readings, and discourse analysis—about data flows during Southern Californian seismic events, we argue that “civic data” is actually a contestable concept dependent upon how people and machines make events.<br /><br />Dewey, J.

A diverse spectrum of data sharing and release practices better describes the available mechanisms and impacts across government, market and citizen. Within this spectrum, the optimism of an inherent public good found in the development of ‘Open Government’ policies in the US is being challenged by increasing and significant skepticism concerning sufficient assessment of context-specific impacts of data sharing. This is to say that the same data is used by different actors for different purposes, most of which custodians of data are <i>unable<\/i> to foresee; data use is generative by definition. This paper considers Public Data as a resilient process and resource requiring consideration of beneficial and detrimental use cases of ‘open data’ and as such, explores new forms of governance (e.g. blockchain enabled licensing), in relation to the empirical case of Australia.\n","Abstracts: The open communication paradigm is permeating the society in multiple realms, inviting the public to processes that were previously inaccessible to them. Open government, open data and open journalism practices apply principles of openness by inviting citizens to participate in policymaking processes online (Aitamurto & Landemore, 2016), publishing scholarly articles online for free (Bartling & Friesike, 2014) and inviting audiences to participate in journalistic processes (Aitamurto, 2015). Open practices can contribute to transparency, civic empowerment, and sense of community. The open paradigm, however, comes with challenges. Civic data overload mitigates the benefits of active participation in open government practices, and the crowd’s input in open journalism risk to compromise the journalistic accuracy. This paper discusses both the promises and the perils of the open paradigm using case examples from the contexts of open government, open data and open journalism. The paper also discusses solutions to the challenges.<br /><br />References:<br /><br />Aitamurto, T. and Landemore, H.

However, rigorous research regarding where communication is situated today, given its interdisciplinary nature, is sparse. In this paper, we put forth methodological tools that diagnose structural forces that reinforce racial and disciplinary biases, using an academic genealogy consisting of 1.4 million researchers as an example.\n","Abstract Body: Diverse voices make science better. The research questions and applications scientists address arise from their lived experiences. Diversifying who engages in science enriches the disciplines.  In the United States, there is a well-documented underrepresentation of students from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM-related) pathways, despite evidence suggesting that these students express interest in pursuing science majors. Near peer mentoring has emerged as an effective alternative to traditional forms of mentoring. In contrast to traditional mentors, near peers are just a few years older than mentees and thereby enjoy a shared language and greater degree of closeness. This research paper reports on a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded three-year study that is using digital storytelling (DST) to document the pairing of career-curious high school students (protégés) with STEM-identifying college students (near peers), who are all from underrepresented groups. This research investigates the power of story to motivate minoritized youth to engage in STEM pathways. The presentation provides initial qualitative findings, and will feature video highlights from the study.\n",null,"Abstracts: Many studies have shown that social networking sites (SNS) serve as important intermediaries for online news. To date, most of this research has relied on self-reports. In our study, we used a combination of (1) web tracking data from an online panel, (2) tracking of exposure to public posts on Facebook via a browser plugin, and (3) an online survey to study the role of SNS as intermediaries in news consumption. Combining such individual-level data challenges open-science ideals as such data is very privacy-sensitive and, hence, prohibits unrestricted sharing. Methodologically, our data-linking approach requires large samples while putting high demands on potential participants which severely complicates making precise forecasts and, thus, inhibits pre-registration. We will present key findings of our approach and preliminary solutions we found for data collection, informed consent, data management, and anonymization. We discuss how open-science practices are possible for such a study design.\n",null,"Abstracts: Although efforts to improve the accountability of social media algorithms have been made in recent years, many have also expressed skepticism about data collection approaches that rely on ‘corporate data philanthropy.’ (e.g., Bruns, 2019). As an alternative to industry-academic partnership approaches, we propose data donation from research participants as a route to audit algorithms. In our discussion, we draw on our experience with three data donation collections. Not only can the donation approach provide researchers and civic society with reachable data access, but also it is expected to afford stable one as platform users’ access rights to their own data are increasingly required by the consumer protection laws. Yet, the new approach also poses methodological challenges, such as ‘small N, large P’ problem and selection bias mediated by privacy concerns and exceeding participants’ technical capacities. We discuss potential innovations to tackle these challenges, such as data augmenting and sample weighting.\n","Abstract Body: Theories of social norms have guided communication research by predicting how and when social norms influence peoples’ behavior. The current research tests for reverse causality between normative perceptions and behavior, in particular, whether or not one’s socially desirable behavior can influence their perceptions of what is typical behavior among people around them. Data from a secondary analysis of a public-goods experiment was analyzed to test the relationship. The data showed that personal donation behavior did not significantly influence perceived descriptive norms. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: To investigate the trend of patient portal use in the general population and the barriers to adoption. We analyzed three iterations of the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) collected in 2014, 2017, and 2018. Measures included patient portal use, highspeed Internet access, data safety confidence, prior experience of online patient provider communication (OPPC), and socio-economic status variables. Logistic regression analyses were conducted separately for the three iterations of HINTS. The results showed that the use of patient portals in the general adult population increased from 25.6% in 2014 to 30.5% in 2017, and 31.4% in 2018. These users were more likely to be female with higher levels of education or income. Meanwhile, highspeed internet access, OPPC, and data safety confidence were positive predictors of patient portal use in all three iterations. We call for more effective interventions to address these gaps. Such interventions should target people of low SES and focus on improving eHealth literacy and patients' confidence in data safety.\n","Abstract Body: As the platform economy keeps on growing, gamification becomes a useful tool for the control of labor in mobile work. Gamification allows platforms to manage labor algorithmically with a subtle approach. With new communication technology, workers can easily engage in the gamified job system through a special app. While researchers are optimistic about the effect of gamification in many sectors, gamification may not always result in ‘blissful productivity’. A survey study involving 529 deliverymen in China was conducted to investigate how engagement in a gamified job system affects job satisfaction and performance. The results suggest that engagement in a gamified job system has a positive impact on motivation to work, which in turn leads to higher job satisfaction and performance. However, a negative effect of gamification engagement on job satisfaction through work stress and anxiety is also observed. In particular, a higher level of gamification engagement elicits work stress and induces anxiety, and consequently decreases job satisfaction and performance. Thus, the total effect of gamification engagement depends on the competition between these two routes. Furthermore, it was found that ease of use moderates the effect of gamification engagement on motivation to work. When the gamified system is easy to use, engaging in gamified activities will exert a much more positive effect on motivation to work.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This study examines the effects of employees’ personal posts on social media on external publics’ online engagement and word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions about an organization. Specifically, it investigates how the message valence (positive vs negative), message content (organization-related vs job-related), and employer reputation (good vs bad) influence on publics’ online (“like,” “share,” and “comment”) and offline behaviors. A 2x2x2 between-subject experiment was conducted online in the U.S. Results showed a significant interaction effect between message valence and employer reputation on publics’ online engagement, which in turn affects WOM intentions about a company. Message valence and message content had significant mediation effects. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: When German broadcast journalist Nicole Diekmann tweeted “Nazis out,” she launched large cultural discussion that many politicians, celebrities, and other journalists partook in. This paper addresses the mediatization of the #NazisRaus debate in German media by comparing the discourses of Diekmann’s tweet in user-generated to its journalistic news coverage. Through qualitative content analysis of both the original responses to the “Nazis out” tweet and the media coverage of the controversy, this analysis yields that user-generated content was overwhelmingly positive while media reporting over the subject was much more critical. As an activist-minded social media enactment, Diekmann’s original tweet stimulated discussions about the message itself, while also simultaneously encouraging expressions of solidarity and generating hate-fueled attacks directed at Diekmann’s identity as both a journalist and a woman. Other journalists covering the debate were much more focused on highlighting the aggression and hate-speech on Twitter, immediately following with reprimanding Diekmann for employing the slogan as a journalist. This study contributes to our understanding of online debates and social media activism by providing a nuanced analysis of the meanings generated through Diekmann’s tweet, #NazisRaus. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This study explores hate-related discourses displayed in media reports in South Korea by analyzing the articles from the major four newspapers in the period of Jan 2003 to May 2019. The analysis has been implemented in 3 perspectives; categorizing most prominent hate-related issues, differences by newspapers’ political orientations and chronological changes in 17 years. The result enables us to understand current hate-related discourse in South Korea, and suggests theoretical implications for future empirical validations and clues for overcoming the current situation from a discursive perspective.\n","Abstract Body: In October 2018, following months of one of the most prolific red tide events in recent Florida history, Vox reporter Brian Resnick called the state’s coast “a rotting marine graveyard.” This paper takes a digital humanities perspective and employs open computational methods to analyze print news coverage about the red tide event.\n","Abstract Body: Modern political activist groups have used humor and parody stunts to ridicule their opponents, to attract media attention, and to generate connective action online. In this paper we analyze the online presence of the Loldiers of Odin, an activist group born as a parody of the anti-immigration group Soldiers of Odin. The group makes their public appearances disguised as clowns. Using network analysis and rhetorical analysis we trace the connective action constituted as a response to the Loldiers’ performances in the digital realm. In particular, we depict how parody stunts as novel, dramatic, and non-institutionalised forms of digital political expression work to generate online action. We argue that while the rhetorical parody strategy offers a novel, compelling way for citizens to engage in the discourses around the immigration question, the ambiguous and debatable nature of absurd parody dampens its potential to actually change the public discourse and mobilize connective action online.\n","Abstract Body: The present study extends counterpublic theory and collective identity mobilization theories by examining how the Argentinian pro-choice movement instantiates their identity. To understand how this counterpublic positions itself within wider feminist networks, I did a multi-modal critical discourse analysis on Facebook discourse. Research found that the collective’s displayed identity was inherently tied to sustained activism and that the interconnectivity of the virtual sphere as a site for identity building acted as a catalyst for added clout.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The Anti-extradition Bill Movement in Hong Kong has been going on for several months in 2019. This paper focuses on examining the Hong Kong Lennon Wall which is a new form of protest communication and important platforms for movement solidarity. Base on vernacular creativity theory and boundary theory, this paper conceptualizes the Lennon Wall and traces its evolution in different protest movements. It analyzes the characteristics of the Hong Kong Lennon Wall, especially the “be water” operation strategy, and examines its role in the Anti-extradition Bill Movement. The analysis shows that the Hong Kong Lennon Wall enables a number of boundary-crossing, including blurring the boundaries between online and offline, center and periphery, audience and author, part and whole, past and present. The Lennon Wall can consolidate citizens’ solidarity. It allows people in the community to express their views, air their frustration, link up protesters and boost movement morale.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Filling the gap in cultivation literature examining new media technologies’ influence on adolescent norm beliefs, this study employed survey methodology of 307 adolescents (13-17 years old) in a national U.S. sample to explore associations between time spent with TV, video games, video game streams, and YouTube and the Masculine Roles Norms Inventory–Adolescent-revised scale (Levant et al., 2016).  Structural equation modeling showed statistical associations for certain media with subscales of MRNI-A-r, including differences between gender.\n","Abstract Body: Although early adolescents believe they are capable of doing anything online, they often fail when it comes to critically evaluating news. This is problematic, because it makes them vulnerable to being wrongly informed. Therefore, there is a need for increased news literacy: that is, being able and willing to access, critically evaluate, analyze, and create news. The current study aimed to develop and test a comprehensive model of news literacy and news consumption in early adolescents. The hypothesized model was based on a combination of knowledge, awareness, motivation, ability, social influences, and demographic differences. The results of a survey among 492 early adolescents to test this model indicated the complexity of predicting forms of news literacy and news consumption. In particular, outcomes signified the importance of the awareness of news literacy, ability, and motivation, and the influential role of peer and parental social norms in both news literacy and news consumption among early adolescents. This implies that ways should be sought to most optimally combine the stimulation of these predictors to ensure that early adolescents will be better able and willing to critically evaluate news in the future.\n","Abstract Body: Questions of gender quality have reached another historical peak in the United States. As in similar points in American history, cultural critics look to media content as an important potential influence on children's acquistion of gender norms and stereotypes. This study content anlayzes one type of media content, toy advertising, on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. This analysis of over 3000 such ads shows that many of the gender stereotypical cues in past studies are still present. However, some shifts were noted in the ads' presentation of some toy types (e.g., building sets) and styles of play (e.g., cooperative play) that were found to be gender-stereotyped in previous research. The results are discussed in light of two frequently applied theories of children's gender acquisition: social cognitive theory and gender schema theory.\n","Abstract Body: Media entertainment is among the most common ways that teens learn how to use humor. Yet, no research has systematically examined humor in teens’ media entertainment. This study addressed this by integrating three leading humor theories (superiority, relief, and incongruity theory) to examine the expression of humor in teens’ preferred media entertainment. A content analysis of teens’ (age 10-14 years) favorite entertainment television shows (107 shows; 5,633 scenes) showed that all anticipated humor types did appear (i.e., aggressive, slapstick, self-defeating, sexual, irreverent, coping, satire, wordplay, incongruity, and absurdity humor), but their presence varied greatly. Even more, humor types typically did not occur in solitude, but in one of four combinations: (1) satire and wordplay, (2) self-defeating and aggressive humor, (3) incongruity, absurdity, and irreverent humor, or (4) coping and sexual humor. Results highlight the complexity of humor in media entertainment and the need for further scholarship on this topic.\n","Abstract Body: This cross-sectional study (N=1636; M<sub>age<\/sub>= 15; SD=1.17) is the first to investigate whether alcohol portrayals depend on the social media message type under consideration (private-persistent, private-ephemeral, public-persistent, public-ephemeral). Extreme references are most prevalent across private and public ephemeral messages. Additionally, this study investigated which message types were associated with binge drinking. When all message types were taken into account, only private persistent and ephemeral messages increased the odds to engage in binge drinking.\n","Abstract Body: While quite a lot of research has been conducted on sexual harassment in offline contexts such as the workplace, much less is known about online sexual victimization (OSV) and its consequences. The current study is one of the first that examines the long-term effects of online sexual risk behaviors on psychosocial well-being. Based on a representative sample of Internet users aged 14 to 64 years, the effects of sexting, sexy self-presentation, and OSV on three different indicators of psychosocial well-being (depression/anxiety, life satisfaction, loneliness) were investigated over a period of one year. The results confirm previous findings by showing that online sexual engagement is related to an increased risk of being victimized and that being victimized online is associated with more loneliness and more symptoms of depression and anxiety. Concerning long-term effects, only a higher sexting willingness at T1 was positively related to victimization one year later. However, it must be considered that the results refer to a broad, representative sample of mostly adult online users. The findings might be different for specific and more vulnerable groups such as children, adolescents or persons with different sexual orientation.\n","Abstract Body: This paper argues that most scholarship on social media use has often a) not placed the use of social media in relation to other media; b) relied on single-country data from nations usually situated in the Global North; and c) examined one platform at a time. This has limited the descriptive fit and heuristic power of this scholarship. We propose the development of a comparative social media studies perspective that highlights the cross-media, cross-national, and cross-platform dimensions of platform use. We review what has been learned from studies which have undertaken at least one of this type of comparisons. On the basis of this knowledge, we then lay out key building blocks of a programmatic agenda by focusing on possible pathways that seem especially fruitful: histories, languages, and explanations. We conclude by reflecting on the theory-building potential of exploring the intersections across the three types of comparative work.\n","Abstract Body: Studies identified various antecedents of the pathological use of social media, such as motivations and personality traits. Much attention is focused on the five-factor personality model, dark personality traits, such as narcissism, machiavellianism, and psychopathy, have attracted growing attention as well. Furthermore, few studies have investigate the interplay between personality traits and motivations to social media disorder. In our study, we investigated the relationship between dark personality traits to social media disorder with four social media motivations (i.e., entertainment, communication, relationship maintenance, and self-expression) acting as mediators. We collected data from an representative online survey of 1865 German respondents. Parallel mediation results indicated that the dark personality traits have direct and indirect effects on social media disorder scores, with mixed results in their indirect effects via relationship maintenance. Thus, our study contribute in building a theoretical model of social media disorder.\n","Abstract Body: The “datafication” of society designates the increasingly pervasive role that the production, circulation, collection, and processing of data through digital technologies play in everyday life. Datafication has received much attention in media and communication scholarship. These works point out social, political and economic implications of datafication, be they framed as negative, like big data-driven surveillance (van Dijck, 2014), and data colonialism (Couldry & Mejias, 2019), or rather positive, like open data-driven sousveillance (Goëta, 2015), and data activism (Milan, 2017). While some authors note that data empowers social actors who have the means to make sense of it (Lycett, 2013; Powell, 2014), little research has explicitly focused on the publics involved in datafication processes: to what extent is this wealth of data actually used, by which publics, how and for what purpose? How do actual users and uses concur with or differ from the publics imagined and targeted by the instigators of data production and publication projects? Alongside the notion of “datafied publics” (Baack, 2015) which stresses the algorithmic objectification of digital media publics through the data they generate, we propose the term “data publics” to refer to the social <i>subjects<\/i> actively interacting—or which are expected to interact—with data made available to them.<br /><br />This contribution will provide theoretical and empirical foundations to the concept of data public, as it emerged in the course of a research project on sociopolitical aspects of datafication. We conduct three case studies of organizations involved in the production and publication of public and private data. The methodology consists of an ethnography of each organization, combined with document analysis, semi-structured interviews, and a contextualized monograph. The cases are:<br /><br />- A city-level government project organized around an open data portal, initiated by the City of Montreal;<br />- A collaborative platform for sharing health-related personal data, Pulsar, set up by a health care research consortium in the Quebec City area;<br />- A group of data activists, Data for Good Montreal, helping local community groups in Montreal with leveraging and publishing their data.<br /><br />Each of these cases is confronted with specific challenges related to the different “audiences” they are targeting (residents of a town, users of the health care system, community organizations), starting with the challenge of reaching them and encouraging them to use the data. Our research consists of investigating which data publics are expected (imagined) in these initiatives and to compare them with the effective (actual) publics that make use of the data. We thus take into consideration how the people concerned by a specific dataset experiment—or not—with the data.<br /><br />Approaching data through the lens of their publics calls for an epistemological perspective that is the opposite of what can be called the “cult of data”, for which data production is seen as an end in itself. On the contrary, we rely on a sociotechnical epistemology to examine datasets as they are developed, coded, conceived and operationalized. For instance, if we were only interested in data, we could ask what the data provided by the city council tells us about housing issues in that city. But if we consider the publics of these datasets, we can ask to what extent there is a public for them, or whether their actual public corresponds to their expected publics. Further, it allows us to question how the <i>social issue regarding housing<\/i> in that city is conceived, constructed, translated into that datafication process (which questions are asked and avoided, which aspects are documented and ignored, how is the information organized, labelled, what is left aside or promoted), and with what consequences. Investigating data publics means enquiring about not only the targeted users of these data, but also the ones that are excluded and the ones that become the actual users (for instance the real estate development companies versus the citizens).<br /><br />A number of new terms have been proposed by media scholars to account for the transformations of publics in the contemporary context of networked digital technologies: networked publics (boyd, 2011), affective publics (Papacharissi, 2015), ad hoc publics (Bruns et Burgess, 2011), to name a few. Their nuances reflect the long-standing ambivalence of the notion of public, torn between two poles of meaning: cultural (audiences) and political (collectives) (Livingstone, 2005). Viewing data not just as mere extracted resources but as socially, technically, and culturally constructed objects (Gitelman 2013)—as <i>media artifacts<\/i>—allows us to reconsider that ambivalence from a novel and insightful perspective. The term “data publics” is meant to shed light on these groups of individuals who are tied by data (and on how these collectives get formed); but it is also useful to think about the datafication of society from a sociopolitical perspective: which publics are targeted, produced, excluded, for what purposes, to what effects?<br /><br />As said before, data publics constitute a useful lens to explore a variety of dimensions of the notion of public as they have been articulated by leading theorists of publics, from Dewey (1927) to Fraser (1990), Dayan (2005), and Marres (2012), in addition to those previously cited. These dimensions can be organized around three axes of tension:<br /><br />1. Between a political conception and a commercial conception of publics;<br />2. Between cultural agency (interpretation) and technical agency (configuration);<br />3. Between rationality-driven and affect-driven gatherings.<br /><br />The fieldwork we have done so far suggests that data publics—imagined or actual—feature this multidimensionality. Our presentation will propose a mapping of data publics around the three axes described above, illustrated with examples drawn from our case studies.<br /><br />In sum, the concept of data publics defines a two-fold agenda for research on datafication which, on the one hand, examines how publics are imagined by data producers and designers of services around these data, and how sociopolitical issues are articulated and translated into strategies of data opening and publication. On the other hand, it provides ground to question and document how these issues get (re)articulated, ignored, or reappropriated by other actors. Studying data publics therefore contributes to the understanding of what kind of society datafication produces and reproduces.<br /><br />References<br /><br />Baack, S. (2015).

However, different social media platforms vary drastically from each other in terms of their features (e.g., experiences offered, affordances), meaning that frequency-based measures of social media use do not capture the richness in behaviors occurring within social media platforms. We address this lack of attention to individual differences in social media use by designing a series of SMU scales that assess various within-platform social media behaviors for four popular platforms: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. We aim to propose a new measure of SMU that is simultaneously sensitive to both - the feature-based idiosyncrasies and consistencies of different social media platforms. We investigated the structure of SMU behaviors, both within and across platforms, and attempt to delineate its relation with individual differences in diverse demographic and personality traits. To understand the psychological dispositions that may be driving within-platform behavior on these platforms, we also examined the relationships between the Big Five Traits, the Dark Triad, Self-Esteem, Mental-Wellbeing (e.g., WHO Well-being Index, UCLA Loneliness Scale, Diener Life Satisfaction Scale), and Rosenberg Attachment Styles.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This ongoing study examines how female game streamers in Southeast Asia, the fastest growing e-sports market in the world (Kooistra, 2019), make sense of their presentation of self as women and as Southeast Asians. In particular, it explores how young Singaporean and Filipina streamers, using a medium perceived as dominated by Western content creators, in a region whose game industry and culture is similarly dominated by foreign games (Chung, 2015; Fung & Ho, 2015), might cultivate audiences of niche globality. Niche globality describes the way media texts and performers originally developed for local audiences can find new, unintended audiences overseas and thereby serve as windows to transcultural experiences (Tolentino, 2013). Preliminary findings from phenomenological interviews and ethnographic observation suggest how these streamers decide to present themselves when they stream, how they define success as streamers, and how they perceive and/or position themselves as female and Singaporean/Filipina streamers in the larger, global (and often sexist) landscape of streaming and e-sports.\n",null,"Abstract Body: The purpose of this study is to investigate how type of online access (mobile-only vs. hybrid users) and digital skills relate to misinformation sharing. The preliminary results, based on the first wave of a panel survey of a representative sample of internet users in Chile, show that mobile-only users with higher levels of operational skills but low levels of social skills are more likely to share fake news.\n","Abstract Body: Motivation<br />Administering surveys on the general population using traditional methods such as postal mail and phone can be prohibitively expensive. Online samples offer a helpful alternative with their often considerably lower costs. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) is one example of a platform that offers cheaper alternatives to traditional data collection for academics. While this is a welcomed addition to possible data sources, it is important to recognize what biases may be present in relying on such a platform for sampling. Depending on one’s research questions, sampling on AMT may present serious limitations. For example, if research questions have to do with social media uses – an increasingly large focus of scholarly attention – then knowing how AMT respondents may differ from the general population in their social media use experiences is essential. If research questions probe differences in active online engagement then knowing how the AMT respondent pool differs from the general population in online participation is significant. This paper analyzes responses to identical survey questions administered to both AMT participants and a U.S. national sample at the same time. We compare the two samples on their use of social media sites focusing on what platforms they use as well as their experiences engaging in various online activities. We show that the two samples are different in their online behaviors. We discuss the implications of these findings for data collected on AMT for studying people’s online behaviors.<br /><br />Data and Methods<br />We draw on two data sets collected at overlapping times to compare respondents from an Amazon Mechanical Turk sample consisting of U.S.-based participants with a national U.S. sample. Both surveys were administered online. For the national sample, we contracted with the independent research organization NORC (formerly the National Opinion Research Center) at the University of Chicago to administer questions to their AmeriSpeak panel online. We ran the AmeriSpeak survey May 25-July 5, 2016 and the AMT survey June 24-28, 2016.<br /><br />Measures: Demographic and Socioeconomic Factors<br />Background variables about respondents such as their age, gender, education, income and race/ethnicity were supplied by NORC based on previous data collection about the AmeriSpeak panel. We asked AMT respondents similarly about their socio-demographic characteristics. [More details in the final paper.]<br /><br />Measures: Social media use and online participatory activities<br />Social media use. We asked participants whether they use various social media such as Facebook, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Instagram, Reddit, and Twitter. We started by asking them whether they had ever heard of these sites. Next, we asked: “Have you ever visited the following sites and services? For each site or service, indicate if no, you have never visited it; yes, you have visited it in the past, but do not visit it nowadays; yes, you currently visit it sometimes; yes, you currently visit it often.” We calculate current users by adding up those who reported visiting the site currently sometimes or currently often.<br /><br />Online participatory activities.<br />To get a sense of how active people are online regarding the sharing of their own content, we asked about several online participatory activities (see Table 1 for a list of these). These were dichotomous yes-no questions. We created a summary score representing the number of these ten activities with which respondents reported experiences.<br /><br />Analysis<br />We compare the two samples in multiple ways. First, we calculate descriptive statistics for all of our measures. Second, to test whether these relationships are robust to controlling for other variables, we then estimate multiple regression models. [The latter not included in this extended abstract.]<br /><br />Results: Comparing the two samples<br />Table 1 shows differences in the social media use and online participatory activities between the two samples. AMT respondents are statistically signficantly more likely to use all of the social media included on the survey: Facebook, Pinterest, Linkedin, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit, Snapchat. In total, the average AMT respondent uses 3.6 such sites compared to 2.3 social media platforms for the average US Internet user.<br />We also find statistically significant differences by online participatory activities where, again, AMT respondents are significantly more active with all, but two actions included on the survey: an equal portion of AMT and general population adults have “added a coupon code to a site with coupon codes” at 36% in both samples, and “submitted a product review on a specific brand retailer’s site” at 37% (AMT) and 36% (general population). Otherwise, whether it concerns making a loan on a microfinance site or posting a video (either publicly or privately), AMT respondents have considerably more experiences. Overall, they engage in an average of 3.6 activities compared to the 2.6 average for the general population.<br /><br />The final paper discusses the implications of these findings.<br /><br />Table 1.

Through advances in internet technology, parents of children with asthma go to online chat room to get peer support. Yet, it is unclear how social network position (i.e., brokerage and influence), and support provision would affect social support reception.<br />This study applied social network analysis and quantitative content analysis to examine the network positions, social support provision and reception in an online QQ chat room for caregivers for children with asthma. We found participants in this online chat room focus on information exchange. Moreover, emotional support is provided more to users that are focal and important in the network than others. Practical implication for system design, health practitioners and online users are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Dealing with technology in social life can create a different meaning of human interaction. Social media has changed the way people interact and communicate with others because using online technology is socially and materially entangled. Using online ethnography, our research is looking at sociomaterial practices occurring when different groups produce a collective knowledge of a certain topic. Our research is based on social practices discussing LGBTQ issues on social media in Indonesia. Until mid of 2018, the LGBTQ issues are heavily discussed regarding to the criminalization of LGBTQ in Indonesian Draft of the Criminal Code. Namely <i>Perkumpulan Arus Pelangi <\/i>and <i>AILA Indonesia<\/i> are online Facebook groups that are quite vocal in shouting LGBTQ issues.  Results show that these sociomaterial practices are very local. We will present our methodology of researching sociomaterial practices which goes beyond researching the use of facebook by both groups members.<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: This extended abstract examines the factors that drive teacher selection among language learning platform users. In particular, we examine how gender, professional teaching qualifications, and native-speaker status affect the likelihood of selection. The role of gender and certified skills has already been extensively examined in the gig work literature (Leung & Koppman, 2018). There are also several studies that point to the so-called “home advantage” for workers located in the same country as employers (Liang, Hong, Gu & Peng, 2018). In our case, however, we hypothesize that the home advantage relates not to location but rather to native-speaker status, an important factor in contouring the market for language teaching. This is in keeping with existing literature, which indicates that: 1) nationality/ethnicity and language are generally closely conflated (Anderson, 1984; Lie, 2014; Canagarajah, 2012); and 2) native-speakers are perceived as being the “authentic” or “correct” speakers of a language (Norton, 1997; Halliday, 2006). Despite being highly questionable from a linguistics point of view (Lee, 2017), these mutually reinforcing language ideologies are socially dominant and significantly affect the operation of online language platforms.\n","Abstract Body: <br />Medical Credentialing Cues in Online Reviewer Credibility Assessment<br /><br />This extended abstract describes a study that explores how medical credentialing cues in an online username can influence individuals’ credibility assessments of a reviewer of a medical product in an online marketplace. Since health products and over-the-counter medications (e.g., Claritin) are widely sold on sites like Amazon, and these products tend to be widely reviewed, reviewer user names (e.g., NurseAnn) that indicate a medical credential can contribute to our understanding of how individuals assess the reviewers of these kinds of products online.<br />Previous research has indicated differences in how individuals assess the credibility of online reviewers, depending on if they are considered to be “professional” reviewers with inside knowledge of the product type, or “lay people” who may have less background/professional knowledge, but have experienced the product (Lee & Bradlow, 2011; Willemsen, et al., 2012). However, much of this research has focused on how individuals perceive the credibility differences in perceptions of user reviews when looking at more conventional consumer products, such as cameras (Bae & Lee, 2011). There has been a distinct lack of research on how expertise cues can affect perceptions of reviewer credibility when it comes to health-related products, such as over-the-counter medications.<br />There has also been a lack of credibility assessment research that has looked at how the username of online reviewers may serve as a cue for expertise in a particular product area. Health-related products may prove to be an intriguing opportunity for this, as one can easily make a username that implies a medical profession (e.g., NurseAnne). Since perceptions of credibility are traditionally thought to comprise evaluations of both expertise and trustworthiness, these may play out differently when someone has a username that implies a health credential. Someone who is presumed to be a physician or a nurse can reasonably be assumed to have special expertise about a health product; however, this may not be the same for their perceived trustworthiness. Based on Kelley’s covariation model (1973), Huang and Chen (2006) state that a reviewer who self-proclaims expertise, may be perceived as less trustworthy than a layperson or an anonymous post. This could potentially be due to perceptions that someone who self-proclaims medical expertise may have ulterior motives than giving a truly honest and unbiased review.<br />Based on this literature, three hypotheses were proposed:<br />H1: A medical product reviewer with a healthcare credential (e.g., NurseAnne) will be rated higher on <i>perceived expertise<\/i> than either the anonymous or layperson name.<br />H2: A medical product reviewer that is a layperson will be rated higher on <i>trustworthiness<\/i> than the reviewer with the healthcare credential.<br />H1c. An anonymous reviewer will be rated higher on <i>trustworthiness<\/i> than the credentialed healthcare name.<br /><br />Experimental design and procedure<br />This study was conducted as an online survey hosted on Qualtrics. Participants were recruited from Survey Sampling International (SSI) and yielded a final sample size of 1,058 participants. Of these participants, 51% were male, 91% had taken a non-prescription pain reliever in the last six months and about 55% had ever posted a product review.<br />The purpose of this experiment was primarily to determine the effects of the name of the reviewer on reviewer credibility beliefs. Valence of the message and the level of typographical errors in the review were also included in the experimental design, but these are not analyzed here. Toward that end, we conducted a 3 X 3 X 3 full factorial design with a control. We manipulated the name of the reviewer (anonymous, AnneB, or NurseAnne), review valence (positive, negative, 2-sided), and errors in the review (none, few [~3], or many [~15]).<br />All study participants (including those in the control condition) were given basic information about a hypothetical non-prescription pain reliever called Alogen, as well as the average online user rating for this product. Primary measures were 23 bipolar semantic differential scales that included the standard items for trustworthiness (e.g., reliable- not reliable; honest - not, trustworthy – not) and expertise (e.g., experienced – not; competent- not) from Ohanian (1990).<br /><br />Results<br />ANCOVAs was conducted in SPSS to determine the outcomes on perceived expertise and perceived trustworthiness. In the name main effect, those who viewed the review with the name of NurseAnne (M=4.64, SD=1.28), rated it significantly higher on perceived expertise than those who viewed the review with the name AnneB (M=4.33, SD=1.24, p=.004) and those who viewed the review written by anonymous (M=4.34, SD=1.31, p=.012). Hypothesis 1 posited that a reviewer with self-identified expert credentials (Nurse Anne) would rate the highest on perceived expertise, and it was supported.<br />There was a significant effect of name on perceived trustworthiness of the reviewer as well, however not as we expected. We anticipated that the anonymous or layperson reviewer would be rated higher on perceived trustworthiness, but that was not the case. In fact, the reverse was true. NurseAnne (M=5.01, SD=1.27) was rated significantly higher on perceived trustworthiness than the anonymous reviewer (M=4.77, SD=1.27, p=.029) only. Thus, hypotheses H2 and H3 were not supported.<br /><br />Conclusions<br />The results of this study indicate that online reviewers of health products whose username implies a health credential are viewed differently by consumers who read their reviews. In particular, ratings of expertise were consistently higher for users who read a review by “NurseAnne,” as opposed to “AnneB” or an anonymous reviewer. This indicates that users do actually pay attention to the username on online review sites, and they do glean some impression of expertise in cases where the name signals a health credential. The results also indicate that the credentialed username can have an effect on perceptions of the reviewer’s trustworthiness. Since these are the two classic components of credibility assessment, the results show an important connection between credibility assessment and credentialing in an online reviewer’s username.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />References<br />Bae, S., & Lee, T.

The novel commentary system that overlays users’ comments directly on the window of the online video within the time of the video was once regarded as empowering active audience and enhancing collective interactions. However, drawing on two rounds of year-long digital ethnography and the analysis of the cultural artifacts on this platform, the study argues that users’ ways of engagement in this participatory culture are much oriented to the perceived affordance, and are always intertwined with particular social and cultural circumstances. Moreover, the state authorities in cooperation with capital are more powerful in deciding and transforming the affordance compared to the users. The empirical study of Bilibili case not just fills the gap in understanding how Chinese digital platforms are shaping and shaped by their users and the society in Chinese Internet studies, but also rethinks the role of digital platforms in the East Asian cultural context, in particular connected to the cultural flow among China, Japan, and South Korea.\n","Abstract Body: This project investigates why people watch study-with-me vlogs, a type of online video in which vloggers film themselves studying alone in silence. At least on the surface, these vlogs seem different from other genres, such as education and entertainment videos online. This project aims to characterize them in terms of those differences and understand the audience’s motivations for watching them. We address the first aim by conceptually defining the features of study-with-me vlogs. We address the second aim with two surveys. The first survey asks viewers to explain briefly the reasons they watch study-with-me vlogs, which we will analyze using quantitative content analysis. Based on the results of this analysis, we will develop a second survey, potentially driven by uses and gratifications perspective and virtual community participation, to understand to what extent viewing behavior is related to different motivations.<br />Keywords: vlogs, study with me, online learning, motivations, use and gratification<br />Theoretical backgrounds<br />Video blogging (vlogging) has gained much attention in research on virtual communities (Warmbrodt, Sheng, Hall & Cao, 2012), parasocial interaction (Hwang & Zhang, 2018), and consumer brand perceptions (Lee & Watkins, 2016). However, study-with-me vlogs, an online trend of study videos featuring vloggers studying alone in silence, have received little attention. Study-with-me vlogs appear similar to other forms of blogging in the sense that vloggers may have similar motivations to create content, for example, self-disclosure to others (Fun & Rachael, 2005), sharing knowledge (Chai & Kim, 2010), seeking attention (Park, Ahn & Kim, 2010), cultivating a sense of community (Top, 2012; Stavrositu & Sundar, 2012), and facilitating social contact (Harley & Fitzpatrick, 2009).<br />On the other hand, study-with-me vlogs seem different from other forms of blogging in that they are not obviously created for self-expression (e.g., Herring & Scheidt, 2004; Nardi, Schiano, Gumbrecht & Swartz, 2004). For example, vloggers leverage the advantages of videos and use non-verbal cues such as eye contact, body gestures, and turn-taking to connect with the viewers, forming an impression of engagement and intimacy (e.g., Harley & Fitzpatrick, 2009; Zhang, 2019). In contrast, study-with-me vloggers have little or no direct engagement with their viewers. If they address their viewers directly, it usually occurs at the beginning or end of a vlog to introduce and conclude the study session. Despite study-with-me vlogs lacking a conversational emphasis, it is still possible viewers experience social presence of the vloggers. Social presence is related to the affordances of media to transmit nonverbal cues (Short, Williams, & Christie, 1976), which can affect the emotional and social experience of computer-mediated interaction (Walther & Burgoon, 1992). Recent work has focused on social presence in the context of e-learning, where student perceptions of each other and their instructors can affect the learning experience and outcomes (for a review, see Richardson, Maeda, Lv, & Caskurlu, 2017).<br />In one regard, study-with-me vlogs are a kind of learning activity because their focus is on studying. In other regards, they are different from things like e-learning (McConnell, 2005), study groups (Brindley, Blaschke & Walti, 2009), online informal learning (Tan, 2013), and learning communities for online courses (Liu, Magjuka, Bonk & Lee, 2007). Appendix 1 summarizes similarities and differences among these activities in regards to medium, purpose, source, and participants. With attention to these characteristics, we suggest a working definition of study-with-me vlogs as broadcast computer-mediated videos produced by a content creator that enhance social presence through the silent activity of studying. This characterizes study-with-me vlogs in terms of sender, channel, and content; but it says little about the viewers except there may be many them. Why to viewers watch study-with-me vlogs? The answer to this question is the focus of this project.<br />Method<br />To address our research question, this project will analyze data from two online surveys. Both surveys draw convenience samples from the more than 300,000 followers of a Chinese study-with-me vlogger, whose vlogs appear on Weibo and Bilibili, popular social media and video sharing platforms in China. The vlogger agreed to share survey links with her followers.<br />The first survey is ongoing with a target sample size of 800 and seeks to know the different motivations for watching study-with-me vlogs. After confirming they are 18 years or older, respondents received the study information and consented to participate. The survey asked a single question in Chinese, which translates to English as, “please give one or two sentences why you like to watch study-with-me vlogs.” We will conduct quantitative content analysis to identify the variety of motivations and their relative prevalence. This analysis will involve four steps: (1) review qualitative data and develop a coding scheme that identifies different motivations, (2) analyze the inter-rater reliability of the coding scheme, (3) score the data from each respondent for the presence or absence of each motivation, and (4) conduct statistical analyses. This part of the data will also include qualitative descriptions of the different motivations.<br />The second survey will take place in November or December 2019 with a target sample size of 1,200. We will craft a questionnaire based on the results of the content analysis. As much as possible, we will use or adapt items from prior research. Respondents will indicate to what extent their viewing reflects each of the motivations. We will use structural equation modeling to predict different aspects of viewing including frequency, duration, satisfaction, and perceived social presence. We will likely situate results within the uses and gratifications framework.<br />Contribution<br />Prior research has already taken a uses and gratifications approach to understand why people use online media (e.g., Shao, 2009), including specific uses of online videos (Park & Goering, 2016). The current study contributes to the literature by explaining the use of unique kind of online media, which may reflect those motives, but in ways we think will deviate from what prior research has shown. Initial review of the qualitative data from the first survey suggests motivations including social encouragement, social activity, companionship, goal pursuit, and skill development. The full analyses will create a more complete portrait.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Mass communication content is consistently shaping individuals’ perceived social reality as well as their beliefs, attitudes, and behavior (Bandura, 1986; Gerbner, Gross, Morgan, & Signorielli, 1994). Previous research has found that exposure to mass media content emphasizing women’s attractive and sexy appearance leads to favorable attitudes toward and behavior to achieve ideal body image (e.g., Moradi & Huang, 2008; Hall & Crum, 1994; Garner, Garfinkel, Schwartz, & Thompson, 1980). However, such objectification effects have mainly been studied in the context of mass media, such as magazine and television (Garner et al., 1980; Yan & Bissell, 2014). To extent the research on objectification theory, in the current study, we investigated the effects of social media sexual objectification experience on internalizing of the value of ideal body image, given that social media function similarly as traditional media in terms of delivering information to a large amount of audience (O’Sullivan & Carr, 2018). In addition, we included the use of beautifying photo applications as another outcome as self- objectification.<br />The objectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997) suggests that media sexual objectification influences self-objectification, which in turn leads to self-surveillance. In details, media sexual objectification refers to that media contains sexualized contents. Self- objectification pertains to individuals to internalize these standards in order to place greater value on how they look to other people. Self-surveillance refers to individuals’ efforts in achieving the ideal body image such as dieting, exercising, or having plastic surgery (McKinley & Hyde, 1996; Szymanski, Moffitt, & Carr, 2011). In addition, some subsequent research has refined the theory<br />and suggested that internalized favorable attitudes toward ideal body was one important factor that mediates the effect of media objectification experience on self-objectification (e.g., Haines et al., 2008). Therefore, we proposed Hypothesis 1 (H1) as follows:<br />H1: Sexual objectification experience on social media is (a) positively associated with favorable attitude toward ideal body, (b) which in turn positively associated with self- objectification.<br />Self-surveillance has been found to be the major outcome of self-objectification, which includes, but not limited to, dieting, exercising, and comparing with the ideal body (Buchanan, Fischer, Tokar, & Yoder, 2008). However, with increasing popularity of beautifying photo applications (Iwamoto & Kurihara, 2019), individuals could achieve the attractive appearance in their self-presentations via using the technology tools. The features of beautifying photo applications, such as remove blemishes or reshaping the face and body, enable users to manage their appearance. In fact, previous research has found that individuals who are more concerned about their appearance are more likely to use such beautifying photo applications (Chua & Chang, 2016; Ellison, Heino, & Gibbs, 2006). Therefore, we argued that the use of beautifying photo applications could be another outcome of self-objectification, as proposed in Hypothesis 2 (H2):<br />H2: Self-objectification is positively associated with behaviors to achieve ideal body, including (a) self-surveillance and (b) using beautifying photo applications.<br />Method<br />We conducted an online survey with 409 Chinese young adults (79% female, n = 261)<br />with an average age of 24 (SD = 5.82) years old. The data were collected via convenience<br />sampling from a large college in central China. The IRB approved the research procedure and questionnaire.<br />We measured social media sexual objectification experience (M = 4.38, SD = 1.34, α = 0.92) (Burnett, 1995; Moradi, Dirks, & Matteson, 2005), attitudes toward ideal body (M = 4.38,SD = 1.34, α = 0.92) (Thompson et al., 2004), self-objectification (M = 3.07, SD = 0.90, α = 0.89) (Noll & Fredrickson, 1998), self-surveillance (M = 4.37, SD = 1.41, α= 0.82) (McKinley & Hyde, 1996), and the use of beautifying photo applications (M = 2.15, SD = 1.18, α = 0.74). Age, gender, and social media use frequency (per week) (M = 3.07, SD = 0.90, α = .66) were controlled in the analysis. The results of confirmatory factor analysis showed that all the factor loadings ranged from 0.57 to 0.89. The correlations among all study variables were presented in Table 1.<br />Results<br />The structural equation modeling results showed that sexual objectification experience on social media was significantly and positively associated with attitudes toward ideal body image (β = .61, p < .001). Attitudes, in turn, were significantly and positively associated with individuals’ self-objectification (β = .76, p < .001). Furthermore, self-objectification was significantly and positively associated with the use of beautifying applications (β = .35, p < .001) as well as self-surveillance (β = .23, p < .001). Thus, the data were consistent with H1 and H2. The model was visualized in Figure 1.<br />Discussion<br />The current findings show that social media has the similar effects as mass media in terms of objectification. Exposed to sexual objectified contents on social media influences audience’s perception of the ideal body image and internalized them as integrated standards to be<br />achieved (Fox & Rooney, 2015; Fardouly & Vartanian, 2016; Zheng, Ni, & Luo, 2019). In addition, we found that self-objectification is significantly related to using beautifying photo applications. Using a applications to adjust body figure image is similar to the outcome of body surveillance by changing individuals’ perceptions of their appearance (Gapinski, Brownell, & LaFrance, 2003; Paulhus, 2007).<br />To sum up, we found that, similar to the objectification effects documented in the context of traditional mass media, sexual objectification experience on social media was significantly related to favorable attitudes toward ideal body image, which in turn increased self- objectification among Asian young adults. Most importantly, self-objectification led to not only body surveillance but also the use technology – beautifying photo applications – to achieving ideal body image. By studying the objectification theory in the context of social media as well as including the technology use of another outcome of self-objectification, the current findings extended previous research on the objectification theory and provided some new insights into the field.\n","Abstract Body: Preliminary observation of data collected from an online forum reveals negative correlation between the time delay it takes a forum user to receive one response to his/her first support-seeking post and this user’s subsequent duration of continued forum use and level of interaction engagement. By introducing user expectancy as a potential moderator, a follow-up experiment is proposed under the guidance of MAIN Model to examine whether these effects are mediated by perceived nonverbal immediacy.\n","Abstract Body: Rationale and Research Questions: Science is supposed to be “universal”: As Robert Merton (1942) famously described, the distribution of scientific findings, their evaluation and impact should be independent of the scientists behind these findings, his or her origin and affiliation. In contrast, numerous studies have shown that science and its communication are dominated by representatives and institutions from Anglophone countries, and this phenomenon is particularly prevalent in the field of communication (Lauf, 2005; Repiso & Delgado, 2013; Demeter, 2019). Prior research has explained such Anglophone domination by various historical, geo-political, and linguistic (Gunaratne, 2010; Simonson et al., 2013; Van Leeuwen et al., 2001) factors. Today, as Twitter is acting as an important promotional tool for scholarly work (Kortelainen & Katvala, 2012; Mahrt et al., 2014), we are interested in how socio-technological factors might further exacerbate the existing disparities, through advantaging certain academic output or individual scholars more than others.<br />To do so, we introduce the concept of <i>Twitter-worthiness<\/i> as a theoretical lens to investigate the interplay between social media and academic output. Similar to the concept of “newsworthiness” (Galtung & Ruge, 1965; Staab,1990), “Twitter-worthiness” conceptualises factors making certain content, in our case academic publications, more likely to be shared on Twitter. Therefore, our first research question is: What are the factors making certain publications more likely to be tweeted than others?<br />In addition, we are interested in the feedback of Twitter on promoting academic output, measuring whether scientific publications which are tweeted about often also receive more citations within academia. We are asking: does sharing publication on Twitter boost its citation ?<br />Data and Methods: This study included 32,433 research papers published from 2007 to 2018 in the 84 communication journals indexed in the 2017 edition of Web of Science (WoS). As indicated by our theoretical framework, we are interested in factors contributing to a paper’s performance on Twitter, as well as the impact of Twitter performance in boosting citation. The dependent variable of the whole analysis is the number of citations every paper has received until July 2019. We have operationalized the following independent variables: 1) country - we extracted the country of the corresponding author and categorized them into “US”, “non-US G12” and “non-G12”; 2) Twitter success - we extracted the number of Twitter mentions of each paper using the data from Altmetrics as of July 2019; 3) Q1 Journal - we classified journals according to WoS’s Q1 criteria; 4) Trending topic - using the abstracts each paper and its citation and social media sharing data, we trained a structural topic model and the model identifies two trending topics in our dataset: social media and political communication. The probabilities of each article belonging to the two trending topics were summed and used as an independent variable.<br />The relationships between all the aforementioned variables can be complicated (e.g. papers from the US might have a higher likelihood to be accepted by Q1 journals and in turn, papers published in Q1 journals might have a higher number of citations), so they cannot be analyzed using just one single regression model. Instead, all variables were studied together as a system of regression models using the piecewise structural equation modeling (pSEM) approach (Shipley, 2000) and its implementation in R (Lefcheck, 2015). This pSEM approach can cater for the scale of measurement of the dependent variable in the path analysis. For example, number of citations are count data per unit time and they can be modeled with negative binomial regression inside the system of regression models. Whether or not a paper is published in Q1 Journals is a binary variable (yes/no) and can be modeled with logistic regression. Figure 1 shows all the paths from this system of regression models.<br />Results: Using our dataset and the pSEM approach, we tested every path in our system of regression models (Table 1). Twitter success is correlated with citation impact for papers published in communication journals, regardless of topics, journals, and country of the corresponding author (Path P9). On top of that, we can gain a more nuanced view of how US dominance in communication research is indirectly fostered by the relationship between Twitter success and citation impact. Although the direct relationship between Twitter success and citation impact is attenuated by more than half when a paper is from a US corresponding author (the original regression coefficient of P9: 0.0247, interaction term: -0.0131), it can be indirectly over-compensated by other factors. For example, a paper by a US corresponding author has a greater Twitter success (P1), regardless of topic, or journals. A paper published in a Q1 journal has higher number of citations (P6) and a paper by a US corresponding author has higher likelihood of publishing in a Q1 journal (P4) and mixing two factors can generate a higher likelihood of Twitter success (P1/P5 interaction term). In most cases, papers with US corresponding authors do not cover trending topics (P2). But when they do, they have more citations (P3/P10 interaction term) and are more likely to land in a Q1 journal (P4/P8) than papers by non-US authors. Our analysis also shows that papers with US corresponding authors have more citations, regardless of other factors (P3).<br />Conclusion: Findings show that publications from US/G12 countries (P1), from Q1 journals (P5, P1/P5), and within trending topics (P8) are more likely to be shared on Twitter, or more ‘twitter-worthy’. Our study also confirms the positive impact Twitter success has on citations for all communication researchers (P9). This indicates that social media could potentially be a factor equalising the citation influence of publication from our field. However, the premise of this “equalising effect” is that one’s publication must be visible on Twitter in the first place. In the next stage of our research, we will extend our analysis to cover impacts of various attributes of researchers Twitter profile (e.g. following and follower network, tweeting frequencies etc.). This will help to build a more complete picture on factors contributing to a publication’s twitter-worthiness.\n","Abstract Body: Passive social media use is often linked to poor mental health, including depression. Yet, the vast majority of our social media consumption is passive, as we rapidly scroll through our smartphone feeds and obtain a sense of connection with our contacts. Is such passive social monitoring behavior necessarily bad for our mental health? If so, does it depend on the level of connection obtained by this monitoring behavior? And, what if one is anxious or apprehensive of active participation in a public forum—can passive monitoring provide a safe outlet for maintaining a healthy social contact? We explored these questions with a survey of 342 users, guided by the theoretical framework of interpersonal-connection behaviors. We discovered that social monitoring behavior could indeed trigger a sense of connection, which mitigates the level of depression. Moreover, this indirect relationship is stronger for those who have a mid or high level of communication apprehension in small group communication, in support of compensatory media use proposition. In addition to advancing our theoretical understanding of the psychological effects of passive consumption of social media, our findings have implications for the design of social media affordances for promoting social connection among users with different levels of communication apprehension.\n","Abstract Body: Research centers are founded to facilitate cutting edge, well-funded scientific investigations. Bridging the gap between science and the public is an age-old battle—one the scientific community has spent recent years prioritizing through funding translationally-focused projects. Despite progress, there are still many areas for improving communication between the scientific community and the general public. One strategy where research centers generally struggle to excel is communicating with the public through social media.<br /><br />Over the past two decades, social media platforms have become a central communications strategy for businesses and organizations (Bashar, Ahmad, & Wasiq, 2012; Culnan, McHugh, & Zubillaga, 2010; Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010; Naylor, Lamberton, & West, 2012; Neiger, Thackeray, Burton, Giraud-Carrier, & Fagen, 2013). Research centers lag behind the rapid adoption of social media, due in part to the challenges of producing and sharing knowledge as opposed to a product or service. Knowing which social networks to join, what to post, the amount of professionalism in posts, how often to post, and whether to engage internet trolls is not only different across platforms, but changes with new generations of users. Thus, research centers and similar groups struggle to keep up with the constantly changing norms of each individual social media platform.<br /><br />Guided by media systems dependency theory (Ball-Rokeach & DeFleur, 1976), this project draws on experiences of the Thirdhand Smoke Resource Center (THSRC). The THSRC, funded by the California Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program, launched in May 2019. The mission of the THSRC is to share information, resources, and technical support with California’s residents, communities, businesses, healthcare professionals, and policymakers about the toxic legacy of tobacco smoke residue. The project proposal relied heavily on an interactive website and social media presence as part of the dissemination plan. Despite a well-crafted plan, Center administrators found themselves struggling with navigating the current social media landscape. The guidelines, briefly reviewed here, reflect the “lessons learned” from the THSRC.<br /><br /><i>Begin with a search of the literature<\/i>: This may seem self-evident, but the first step should be to identify the principles that will underlie the social media strategy, maximizing the chances that the social media footprint that can withstand changing trends and different contexts. The THSRC adopted principles described by Burkhardt, 2010; Marklein & Paine, 2013; Neiger et al., 2013; and Waters, Canfield, Foster, & Hardy, 2011: (1) engagement levels are more important than the number of followers one has, (2) be patient, and (3) set realistic expectations regarding audience interest.<br /><br /><i>Create a uniform brand<\/i>: The value of a credible and welcoming look on social media pages should not be underestimated. The THSRC partnered with an undergraduate graphic design course, tasking the students with designing the general center logo as well as the profile images for social media. The selected logo was used in the Center’s physical space, on print materials, and thematically deconstructed for social media use and story creation.<br /><br /><i>Conduct extensive platform research<\/i>: Knowing the most effective social media platforms for your research center and expectations for posts on each of those platforms changes regularly. The leading platforms need to be identified and everyone on the team should have a general understanding of posting norms on those platforms. At the THSRC, a graduate research assistant was tasked with creating a one-hour, evidence-based workshop on social media management.<br /><br /><i>Plan a posting strategy<\/i>: Create a plan that finds the balance between professional “scientific” communication and the more casual, relatable communication of social media. Successful social media platforms communicate with audiences using the language of the platform. Today, that means creating a center hashtag (e.g., #thirdhandsmoke) and using emojis. For researchers and scientists--who are trained to credibly and professionally disseminate scientific findings--casual communication can be difficult to accomplish. Research-based work often requires clear explanation and thoughtful interpretations of data; approaches that are not easily reduced to a 280 character “tweet”. Having a posting plan can provide a manageable structure for turning dense science into digestible posts.<br /><br /><i>Carefully navigate who to engage<\/i>: When you participate on a social media platform, not every post will be met with enthusiasm. Deciding how or if to engage with negative comments is difficult, and research on the best way to handle internet trolls is limited. If you choose to ignore negative comments, you could risk appearing inattentive and disconnected. However, responding increases the risk of contentious engagement. In the first few months of launching the THSRC social media presence, Center administrators drafted scripted responses to negative comments from internet trolls. By the time responses were finalized, the online conversation had either moved on or the account was no longer active. Thus, ignoring trolls has been successful.<br /><br /><i>Connect with similar missions<\/i>: One of the best ways to gain followership on social media is to connect with organizations that have a similar interest, building a mutually beneficial online relationship, so that you can eventually share followers. The old premise that to gain followers you have to follow others is a less successful strategy than it was in the past. The best way to get the attention of other organizations online is to engage with their social media accounts through commenting, sharing, and tagging.<br /><br /><i>Have a dedicated social media manager<\/i>: Without a skilled staff member dedicated to social media, it is not feasible to maintain high levels of audience engagement. At the THSRC, the initial social media plan was to have the investigators manage the accounts; it became immediately clear that this was not sustainable. Appropriate staff were recruited and hired.<br /><br />Developing a strong social media presence is challenging for those who consider themselves trendsetters and highly competent online communicators, let alone for researchers seeking to disseminate their findings to the public. Even for researchers who have personal social media accounts, the ability to translate complex science into interesting and digestible post is a skillset that must be intentionally developed. The guidelines presented here engage tenants of media systems dependency theory in order to assist new research centers with developing a meaningful social media presence that can withstand evolving social media platforms.\n",null,"Abstract Body: I employ a critical autoethnographic perspective via the four-frame model (Harris, 1990) to explore my experience as the introductory communication course director at Iowa State University as part of the Program of Speech Communication, which was housed in the Department of English. The paper examines the history of the dissolution of the Department of Speech Communication and its ramifications on the discipline of Communication at Iowa State University. The outcomes of which have created a paradigmatic partition between communication scholars now housed in two separate programs (see Hale & Redmond, 1995) as well as how the segregation of communication faculty has eroded the capacity to foster the growth and development of generations of communication undergraduate and graduate students at the institution. Through my exploration of these events and perspectives I attempt to bestow a diagnosis of what occurred and strategies for others to remain unified departments of Communication that value and protect the introductory communication course.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Background:<\/i> Media effects has for many years been pointed out as one of the arguable topics in communication studies. In general, media effects theories could be categorized into two sections: context (content) effects and form effects. Marshall McLuhan (1967) expressed his most famous dictum about the effects of media form, \"\"the medium is the message,\"\" which gave rise to the particular aspect of media effects. Although there have been many criticisms of McLuhan's writings, arguably his notion that means the form is superior to the context (content) and considers the effect of the media to be on its form, not just on the context (content) it presents, has largely been used to determine on the effects of different media.<br /><br /><i>Purpose: <\/i>The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of long and prolonged use of Instagram on the user's visual attention by choosing McLuhan's notion as the theoretical framework. Based on McLuhan's theory, active users of Instagram as an image-based medium will experience changes in their attention to contextual content, and they will unconsciously desire to select image-based content regardless of the content consumed. Accordingly, the main hypothesis of this study is that \"\"the long-term and much use of Instagram has significantly a positive relationship with the increased amount of visual attention on news followed with the picture.\"\" Two measures of \"\"time to first attention\"\" and \"\"duration of attention\"\" were used for this examination.<br /><br /><i>Method: <\/i>In this Quasi-experimental research, an eye-tracking tool was used. 60 students from three major Tehran universities with a mean age of 25 years including 30 girls and 30 boys have been selected by using a convenience sampling method. Among these students, 30 were active Instagram users and 30 were low-active users. A static group comparison design was used for this study, which included experimental and control groups. The experimental group consisted of active Instagram users and the control group included low-active users. Then, the clippings of news sites included headline news without pictures, and few headlines with a camera icon indicating the news accompanied by a picture have been shown to each participant for a second. Simultaneously, \"\"time to first attention\"\" and \"\"duration of attention\"\" of the selected ROIs containing the news headline with the camera icon has been recorded with eye-tracker.<br /><br /><i>Results: <\/i>Hypotheses examined by data collection resulted in the confirmation of both hypotheses. The active Instagram users looked at the area where the news headline came with the camera icon sooner and spent much more time compared with low-active users. Our study concluded that long-term use of Instagram as an image-based media, altered people's eye behavior, regardless of the content consumed. So, our finding reinforced McLuhan's popular theory that \"\"the media is the message,” Confirmed through an experimental study with objective findings.\n","Abstract Body: To examine intergroup contact processes online, we conducted a longitudinal field experiment (N = 195) that had a 2 (type of self-disclosure) x 2 (level of visual identification) between-subjects design with time as a repeated measure. Baseline data were collected at least 48 hours prior to the first online meeting and after each of the three planned interactions with trained confederrates, which occurred over the course of a week. The study was pre-registered prior to its launch using the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/4xptb/), and details of the study can be found there. Data collection has been completed, and the data are currently being analysed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This paper evaluates the psychological correlates of imperative speech through pronouns. We demonstrate that people communicate with more collective immediacy (“we” words) using imperatives than non-imperatives in an experiment (Study 1, <i>N<\/i> = 832) and field studies of American politicians (Study 2a: <i>N <\/i>= 123,678 speeches) and Joseph Stalin (Study 2b: <i>N <\/i>= 593 speeches). However, respondents experience a psychological distancing effect after an imperative (fewer “I” words). This experimental pattern (Study 3: <i>N <\/i>= 852) also holds in the field using U.S. Supreme Court dissents (Study 4: <i>N<\/i> = 723). Exploratory findings suggest that third-person plural pronouns (e.g., <i>they<\/i>, <i>their<\/i>) are used more when communicating imperative speech relative to non-imperative speech. Our evidence supports an <i>interpersonal imperatives asymmetry<\/i>: imperatives demand psychological support when communicating how the world must be, but they undermine the autonomy of respondents. Social and psychological implications of these data are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Terrorism is an international, pressing social issue and, arguably, media are the main sources for citizens to understand terrorism. As media coverage in different political, economic, and cultural systems tends to vary, this paper will compare the media representation of terrorism in both Chinese and American media. In order to do so, framing theory will be used to examine media discourses and identify media frames. Previous studies that identified (terrorism) frames mainly focused on qualitative approaches, while this paper explores the possibility of quantitatively identifying media frames based on large-scale datasets, which also facilitates a cross-cultural comparative approach. We find that there are many more news reports about terrorism in American newspapers compared with Chinese newspapers, while Chinese newspapers adopt various media frames to represent terrorism. Concretely, American newspapers engage in war journalism, episodic frames and focus on domestic events or events related to America (like Iraq war), while Chinese newspapers prefer peace journalism and pay more attention to international rather than domestic conflict and war.\n","Abstract Body: Politics has been traditionally dominated by men. However, the internet and social media, which have brought many new characteristics, such as accessibility of information, lower social presence, and anonymity, to the communication environment might challenge this convention. This study used big data and text analysis methods to examine gender differences in the political discussion about nine issues on Twitter. Through analyzing over 1,000,000 tweets, this study found that women’s tweets usually use words or symbols signaling a preference for experiential thinking than analytical thinking, a lower level of agenda-setting efficacy, more individual-level interests, and a dilemma of interaction intention. The findings suggest that women might have different focuses on political issues; they tend to be more critical in discussion but are less likely to go to the extreme of using swear words. Women also show a desire to increase the exposure of their tweets while avoiding direct disagreement or argument.\n","Abstract Body: Language patterns often indicate positive persuasion outcomes across settings. For example, words correlate with financial awards received from funding agencies and the probability of receiving an online loan. This paper tested the preregistered hypothesis that language patterns indicating complexity and confidence relate to a conference submission’s acceptance. Replicating and extending prior work (Study 1), abstracts from the International Communication Association (<i>N <\/i>= 9,559) that have a more complex structure and express more causality tend to be accepted. Study 2 (<i>N <\/i>= 398) experimentally tested if the prior language results affect perceptions of a scientist and their science. In a within-subjects preregistered study, people judged a scientist and their work more positively (e.g., more credible, more intelligent, more novel) after reading a high acceptance probability abstract (e.g., more words, fewer common words, more causal terms) versus a low acceptance probability abstract. Theoretical and applied implications of these data are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: Introduction<br />Post-truth, which was selected as the annual word by Oxford Dictionary in 2016, is defined that emotion and personal belief are more effective than objective facts in shaping public opinions. The narration of the post-truth, tracing to the description for such political events such as Watergate Scandal and Iran Scandal in America, has been used to describe a phenomenon in which discourse serving a particular political purpose manipulates truths or facts. The previous studies have shown a worry that scholars commonly shared that the fundamental belief of truths or facts has gradually been faded away (Oxford Dictionaries, 2016; Laybats & Tredinnick, 2016; Yu & Pan, 2018).<br />However, post-truth refers to recognizing the influence of other factors on the truth rather than a denial of truth. The concept of the post-truth is distinguished within two categories; one is in the process of information production the phenomenon of confusion between truth and various terms relating to it, and the other one is in the process of information receiving the reaction of audiences to all formations of truth (Keane& Wight, 2017). It is emphasized that the analysis of the post-truth should origin from much more standpoints of the audiences, involving their individualized interpretation of information based on different perspectives and their emotions, experiences, and feelings, which would be the interruption to their cognition of the truth. What is more, some scholars would describe the age of post-truth as “the Third Fact,” which is the information with emotionalized truth lying between objective truth and fiction (Jiang & Huang, 2017). It could be seen that emotional expression is an essential feature of media information in the age of post-truth.<br />Presently, the concept of the post-truth has been extended from the political region to more extensive fields. The critical role of emotions has been realized in such studies as cognitive neuroscience and communication (Crilley, 2018). In the communication field, some primary research explored the impact of emotionalized expression on the audiences under the context of new media. For example, emotionalized information could affect the audiences’ cognition on information through emotional contagion (Kramer, 2004). Besides, the emotionalized information, in particular, could also affect audiences’ judgment on the usefulness of the information and further affect their follow-up communication behaviors (Hong et.al., 2016; Ding et.al., 2014). Self-report or computational online data analysis involved is more frequently used in the measurement of how emotionalized information affects the individuals' cognition and behavior. However, it is often criticized for lacking accuracy or too macroscopic, so on the micro-level, the individuals' cognitive processing and emotional experience could not be real-time reflected.<br />In cognitive neuroscience experiments, which could be considered as good open science practices, electroencephalography (EEG) measure has been widely applied, which means to comprehensively reflect through a record of neural activity in the cerebral cortex the individual's cognitive mechanism in the processing information. The technology is harmless to humans, and the data recording is facilitated with higher time resolution, so there is a distinct advantage in the implicit monitoring individual’s real-time information processing. In the previous research, EEG technology is an essential role in the individual emotional experience measurement, in particular as to some subtle emotional stimuli that are not easily perceived subjectively, and different emotion status could be reflected by the changes of EEG signals (Ohme, 2009; 2010; Chen et al., 2017). By far, there have been many studies to prove that there is a close relationship between the individual emotional experience and cognitive processes through EEG experiments. For example, EEG rhythm oscillations were used to measure the audiences' emotional value assessments and approaching responses in different emotional sceneries (Ohme, 2010), asymmetric brain activities in frontal lobe areas related to pleasure in watching videos (Vecchiato et.al., 2011), and the effect of gender or age on individual emotional preference (Cartocci et.al, 2016).<br />Hence, the study is undertaken with the hypothesis that the emotionalized expression of news content in the post-truth era could affect the audiences’ brains cognitive activities. One news text that was written with two different expression types (emotional expression vs. neutral expression) was adopted as experiment materials in the study, and the EEG measures were used to record brain signals in the reading process to observe the influence of emotional discourse on individual cognitive activities.<br /><br />Methods and Results<br />A total of 50 right-handed undergraduates and graduates were recruited and randomly divided into two groups; one experimental group (13 females and 12 males, mean age 22.16±1.91), and one control group (13 females and 12 males, mean age 22.96±2.32). All the participants reported normal or corrected-to-normal vision and had no history of current or past neurological or psychiatric illness and took no medications known to affect the central nervous system. Their emotional statuses were assessed normal by the Chinese Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory and the Positive and Negative Affect Scale. They signed consent before the experiments and were paid for their participation.<br />The two groups were asked to read two news texts (with emotional expression vs. neutral expression). Before the experiment, they were asked to have three-minute tranquillization; and then they were asked to read the text in detail. After the reading, they were asked to answer six questions related to the texts to deepen the image of the content. After finishing the experiment, they took a three-minute tranquillization to recover the emotion status to benchmark. The reading time was about 4 minutes, and the total experiment time was about 10 minutes.<br />The raw EEG data were real-time recorded in the reading process and analyzed off-line using EEG Lab 14.1.1 software. The EEG recording sites were F3, Fz, F4, C3, Cz, C4, P3, Pz, and P4. The average power spectral density (PSD) of the nine sites were analyzed, and the PSD values between the two groups were compared with independent t-test using SPSS 24.0. The results are as follows (shown in Figure and Table).<br />Additionally, functions connectivity (FC) neuroscience method was also used to show scale-free current source density (CSD) to investigate the brain activity of the audience in the processing of reading news texts, and the wPLI index was analyzed in this study. These results will be further reported in the full paper.<br />In the results, first, the delta EEG rhythm wave, which related to the complexity of the task (Harmony et al.,1996), shows that in experimental group the participants encountered a more complex reading task, that is to say a reading with emotional discourse, leading to more attention resources to be input. Second, the theta oscillations index, which is related to the arousal and control of working memory (Gevins et al., 1997; Krause et al., 2000; Deiber et al., 2007; Raghavachari et al., 2001), shows that in experimental group the participants had left fewer attention resources for memory. Third, the weaker alpha EEG power (Davidson, 1995; Sarloet al., 2005) shows in the emotional text reading group the participants had a stronger cortical activity. Fourth, it is worthy noted that the beta EEG rhythm oscillation, which reveals individuals’ attention and cognition focus (Haenschel et al., 2000; Tibbetts, 2013), shows in emotional text reading group the participants had a weaker cognitive resource input, which could indicate that the news content with emotional expression may hinder individuals’ deep thinking in the process of reading.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />In summary, in the post-truth era, news context with emotionalized expression could be easier to activate cortical activity and to attract the attention of the audiences, which could explain a phenomenon that information and reporting with emotionalized expression would be easier to communicate in the media channels. Compared with the neutral and objective discourse, emotional content is equipped with subjective standpoints, and it would be apt to arouse audiences’ interest when it is consistent with their presumed values, beliefs, or attitudes. On the contrary, the study found that audiences may devote much more cognition resources to the task handling texts with emotionalized expression and would have little attention to the actual content or fact itself. In other words, the audience would be easy to stay in the emotion while the emotionalized expression hinders their profound consideration of the truth. The principle of news objectivity is unprecedentedly challenged, and news content rendered with emotions and opinions causes that truth is not fact-based and objective any further, which is one of the critical problems faced by news production in the age of post-truth.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Despite their imposing physical presence and seemingly obvious material impacts, the values and harms stemming from the construction of infrastructural megaprojects remain a speculative affair in Istanbul, Turkey. This paper distinguishes two modes of speculation pertaining to megaprojects that present different ethical and political possibilities, namely dematerializing and rematerializing speculation. By analyzing the internal contradictions and problematic co-existence of these two modes of speculation, we explore encounters between democratic politics that foreground antagonistic contestation and ontological, material politics that foreground nonhuman, planetary forces as well as the situated ethics of care for ecological relations. Heeding such encounters between rather incongruent conceptions of politics is salient because megaprojects in Istanbul intersect two types of crisis: ecological crisis manifesting as imminent urban unsustainability, on the one hand, and democratic crisis manifesting as populism and post-truth, on the other.<br />\n","Abstract Body: This survey study investigates environmental engagement among US citizens, focusing on their opinion leadership qualities and Twitter use. We find a significant effect of opinion leadership on environmental engagement, mediated by Twitter use and psychological variables, such as environmental knowledge and environmental interest. In addition, we examine whether these indirect effects of psychological variables on environmental participation are contingent on individuals’ Twitter use.\n","Abstract Body: In light of the rapid growth of multicultural consumers in the U.S., research examining the impact of intergroup relations is an important topic in marketing communication research. The current study examined the influence of social identity and social distance between consumers and multicultural spokesperson on consumer behavior. Current findings provide intergroup theoretical explanations to increase the knowledge that could assist multicultural advertisers to better understand the effect of utilizing racially diverse spokespersons in marketing communication campaigns. Specifically, racial identity, ethnic identity, and social distance were applied to examine intergroup relations and consumer attitudes. Results suggest that intergroup relations may influence consumer evaluation, when exposed to advertisements featuring various racial and ethnic backgrounds. In particular, Caucasians appear to be receptive to multicultural advertisements featuring spokespersons from a different racial background. Key inter-group communication variables providing practical implications for reaching the multicultural consumer are also examined.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br />ABSTRACT<br />This study investigates the experiences of Filipino online English Language Teachers involved in computer-mediated English teaching platforms as part of the digital platform economy in the Global South. This paper will examine the geocultural, geopolitical, socioeconomic discourses surrounding the Filipino ELT teachers in online platform labor. Furthermore, this paper attempts to explore the post-colonial concept of ‘nativeness,’, the challenges of Filipino English teachers in navigating their way in computer-mediated platforms, facilitating lessons to foreign students as well as their working conditions and online teaching experience. Although, there is a visible online presence and active content discussions when it comes to English Language Teachers (ELT), their experience as online teachers are not yet explored extensively. The data collection includes autoethnographic accounts of the author as a digital worker, analysis of job advertisement, laws and online discussion about platform labor, interviews with Filipino online ESL teachers, administrators, and recruitment personnel.<br /><br /><i>Keywords: <\/i>platform labor, globalization, colonialism\n","Abstract Body: In this paper, we attempt to begin conceptualising the notion of ‘digital infrastructures of intimacy’. This pertains to ICT-based infrastructures of sociality that mitigate, even if only momentarily, the many frictions that arise in doing cross-cultural intimacies. Here, we focus on middle-class millennial Filipino women in the postcolonial capital of Manila and their use of mobile technologies to explore relationships with foreign men. Drawing on ethnographic research, this paper presents how these women use mobile apps to enact ‘digital flyovers’, that is, digital infrastructures that allow them to bypass ‘uncosmopolitan’ Filipino men and to connect with foreign romantic prospects who share their own ‘globalised’ backgrounds and sensibilities. On one hand, these digital flyovers demonstrate how the women possess privileged access to spaces conducive to cosmopolitan global intimacies. On the other hand, these flyovers are unable to change the ‘foundations’ of the society beneath them.\n","Abstract Body: Although there have been many studies about gender issues in sports media, fewer studies have examined gender issues in relation to social media. The present study tried to establish an association between the nature of new media and gender issues by establishing how YouTube uploaders (video creators) treat female athletes. The gender issues were analyzed in relation to two kinds of sexism: sexual objectification and male chauvinism. Attaining a high number of views, a measure of popularity, was assumed to be a common goal of YouTube uploaders, and preview information about each video was presumed to be a critical communication tool to promote the video. Also, this study tested the public openness of YouTube and further examined the relationship between public openness and gender issues on YouTube. The present study found novel points that can shed light on new dimensions of communication in new media.\n","Abstract Body: While a vast body of literature has been generated on underrepresentation and gender inequality, the overrepresentation of women on media, which may also perpetuate gender stereotypes, has not received adequate attention. In this research, we explored the role played by media in overrepresenting females as drivers in the discussion of traffic accidents. Focusing on the case of China, we collected 97,120 posts from Weibo, China's largest microblogging site, and 11,290 newspaper articles dated from January 2010 to November 2018. We used a mixed-method design to understand if and how the overrepresentation of women drivers was used to perpetuate gender bias on social media. The analysis on both China's traditional and social media contents suggests that women drivers have been overrepresented in the public discussion on traffic accidents, and women are more likely to be marked for traffic accidents than men. This pattern is more salient on social media than on newspapers. Meanwhile, we found that social media provided a platform for gender-aware discussion, although the direction of such discussion was far from clear. Our research provides suggestions for future cross-cultural research on gender overrepresentation and new media.\n",null,"Abstract Body: [POSTER PROPOSAL] It is unclear what prerequisites must exist for identification to emerge and what are the constitutive dimensions. Across 3 studies, we seek help clarify the construct using video games. Our first study explored relationships among play time, play motivations, and identification. Insights from study 1 guided study 2, hopefully completed by ICA. As study 3 will be a longitudinal experiment, we hope to gain insight from other game scholars to inform design.<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: This study examined goal gradients effects on individuals’ physical activity by combining the Proteus effect with avatar self-relevance manipulations. Based on the Proteus effect, we predicted that random assignment to an avatar dressed in sports clothes would increase cardiac frequency and step counts relative assignment to an avatar dressed in formal clothes, as sports clothes are more linked to exercising than formal office clothes. Based on self-relevance studies, we predicted that random assignment to an avatar displaying the user’s face would increase cardiac frequency and step counts relative assignment to an avatar displaying a stranger’s face. Participants showed increased cardiac frequency by the end phase of a physical activity task after assignment to an avatar that displayed their own face. Further in support of goal gradient effects, participants displayed more steps by the middle and end running phases when the assigned avatar wore sports instead of formal clothes. This study contributed to the literature by showing how the Proteus effect and self-relevance manipulations influenced physical activity.  <br />\n","Abstract Body: POSTER PROPOSAL<br /><br />This study examines various locomotion techniques and control schemes that have been used by designers to enable users of virtual reality systems to move within immersive virtual environments (IVEs). An experiment is conducted in which participants use different control schemes to explore and subsequently navigate through a series of increasingly-complex virtual art galleries, with outcomes measured in terms of the effect on spatial presence, simulator sickness, and visual-spatial recall.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Despite the rapid growth of Internet communication in China, censorship and firewalls have made access to the platforms including Youtube impossible. This paper examines the LGBTQ community on a new up-and-coming platform called <i>Bilibili <\/i>that acts as a Youtube substitute in China. The paper explores the communicational implications of a popular technological affordance of Bilibili: danmu (within-video scrolling comments), and its impact on the participatory culture, government censorship, and community resistance. We find that the danmu scrolling comments on screen (danmu) affords strategic means for resisting government influence and censorship, namely the use of coded rhetoric to bypass supervision, ridiculing with mild rebellion within acceptable boundaries, facilitating sharing and production, and advocating for social inequities. Implications for the censorship resistance strategist for the LGBTQ community are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines the shift of news frames of climate change in Korea from 2003 to 2017 based on theoretical views of constructionist paradigm of media framing and political economy approach to global climate change discourse. News frames are conceptualized as associations of ideas, or words, which are inductively detected using <i>K<\/i>-means clustering. Employing non-parametric ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis test), this study demonstrates that news frames of climate change have shifted over time to represent market-oriented views, marginalizing traditional views in environmentalism that has concerned about carrying capacity of ecosystems and blamed corporations and pro-business policies for causing the current environmental crises.\n","Abstract Body: Through two theoretical lenses, the Health Belief Model (HBM) and literature explaining conspiracy theories, this study examined media discourse about the HPV vaccine in China’s cyberspace. Results showed that the media narratives are positive but misleading, and HBM components are presented inconsistently over time. The study also revealed that the vaccine-related conspiracy theories in China are partially triggered by the fragmented presentation of HBM components, derived from distrust in the government, and rooted in nationalism. These findings demonstrate the influence of public resistance stemming from nationalism on the acceptance of medical knowledge in countries with strong historical legacies, such as China.\n","Abstract Body: As media and communication scholars, it can be easy to overlook the quiet yet immensely powerful ideological constructions that mediate our individual and social lives in deeply significant ways. In this paper, I respond to this year’s theme of Open Communication by considering the nation as a form of mediation that restricts Open Communication and problematizes global discourse. I argue that media and communication scholars can offer meaningful recommendations to this problem by positing alternative conceptual metaphors and mediations for sociopolitical imaginaries that are structured according to relational principles rather than concrete and fixed principles. I recommend that rather than seeking to replace the concept of the nation with another single concept, that we instead embrace numerous local or regional sociopolitical concepts of relationality that co-exist through a logic of translation. I proffer one particular example from my own context of South Africa: <i>ubuntu.<\/i> Using <i>ubuntu<\/i>, I describe an alternative sociopolitical structure comprised of communities defined by contingency and consensus with heterolingual commitments.\n","Abstract Body: This work uses a combination of textual-analysis software and manual review to explore and compare young adults’ shared and received memorable messages (SRMMs) of condom use. Results indicated students were equally confident recalling shared- and received-messages. For source/recipient characteristics, shared-messages were overwhelmingly shared with friends while received-messages came equally from the media and individuals. For shared-messages, although male participants indicated they were about equally likely to share with either gender, females significantly shared with other women. For received-messages, there was no relationship for sender/recipient gender. Channels for media-based messages primarily included clinic materials, movies, and advertising; messages from/to individuals were primarily received/delivered face-to-face. Topics for shared-messages included rich, sometimes misinformed cautionary narratives, while received-messages tended to be briefer, safety-oriented directives. Future analyses will involve in-depth open-coding of SRMMs and assess their relationship with condom-use behavioral variables.\n","Abstract Body: Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing kits, distributed to individuals without health professionals’ intervention by companies like 23andMe, Ancestry.com, and MyHeritage have become increasingly popular in the past few years. The results of genetic tests could be life changing, and have complex political and cultural implications. Despite the fact that most learn about health and scientific topics through the mass media, our understanding of how journalists cover the rapidly growing popularity of DTC genetic kits is lacking, and empirical evidence is scarce. In this study we analyze all the news articles about DTC genetic testing kits published in four major newspapers (over 1,000 news articles) over a period of ten years (2009-2019). Using a novel inductive computational method, combining unsupervised machine learning and network analysis, we find two dominant media frames: one emphasizing the practical uses and utility of the kits and one focusing on the innovation’s cultural, political, and economic implications.\n","Abstract Body: Recent advances in technologies have dramatically changed the healthcare, particularly concerning genetics. One such technology is expanded carrier screening (ECS), which can detect thousands of mutations linked to hundreds of disorders in one test. With this increase in available information comes increased communication challenges for providers, patients, and their families. This experimental study investigated individual and relationship characteristics of prospective parents, media information, and screening intentions. Participants were 48 heterosexual married couples in the pre-pregnancy stage. Participants read hypothetical ECS news articles before having 15-minute decision-making conversations about seeking ECS themselves. Dyadic analysis was conducted with Actor Partner Interdependence Modeling (APIM). Results indicated Actor effects, but no Partner effects. Findings showed positive correlations between partners’ intentions for ECS screening, and partners’ risk avoidance. Attitudes towards ECS positively correlated with screening intention. Risk avoidance negatively correlated to screening intention for females and females need for orientation positively correlated with screening intention.  <br />\n","Abstract Body: Exposure to media portrayals of thin-ideal images has detrimental effects on women’s mental and physical health (López-Guimerà, Levine, Sánchez-Carracedo, & Fauquet, 2010). With the popularity of media content featuring men’s body, scholars and health practitioners are becoming interested in studying men’s body image due to its potential effects on men’s health.<br />This study examines the exposure effects of online model pictures on men’s intentions and attitudes towards weight-loss through the lens of social comparisons specific in appearance and weight. Furthermore, we explore whether the exposure effects of model pictures on men’s intentions and attitudes towards weight-loss are mediated by men’s appearance- and weight-esteem. We also examine the serial mediation effects of two mediators in jointly mediating the exposure effects of model pictures on men’s weight-loss intentions and attitudes (Figures 1 and 2). Appearance-esteem refers to one’s general feelings about appearance, whereas weight-esteem denotes one’s satisfaction about weight. Social comparison is operationalized as individuals’ estimate of their own attractiveness (or weight) relative to the attractiveness (or the weight) from a comparison target, such as a model photo on a website. Weight-loss intentions measure people’s willingness to engage in weight-loss behavior while attitudes measure whether people think it is good or bad to lose weight.<br />Method<br />This study is a re-analysis of unpublished data from an experiment with a 2 (Model attractiveness: attractive vs. unattractive) by 2 (Model weight: thin vs. overweight) factorial design. In a previous publication, the direct effect of exposure to model pictures in affecting individual’s body esteem and the mediation effect of social comparison was reported. In the current study, four two-serial-mediators’ analyses were conducted. The details of each model were presented in Table 1.<br />242 undergraduate male students in the United States participated in this study. Participants were randomly assigned to an exposure condition consisting of pre-tested model pictures with varying degrees of attractiveness and weight. Participants were asked to evaluate the models in terms of attractiveness and weight. Then they were instructed to answer questions regarding their own appearance- and weight-esteem. Participants then rated themselves in terms of perceived physical attractiveness and weight, along with their weight-loss intentions and attitudes.<br />The appearance-related social comparison was calculated by subtracting individual participant’s ratings of models’ average attractiveness from his own attractiveness rating. The weight-related social comparison was calculated by subtracting individual participant’s ratings of models’ body size from his own body size rating. Participants’ appearance-esteem (<i>α<\/i> = .88) and weight-esteem (<i>α<\/i> = .85) were measured with a 5-point Likert-type scale (Mendelson, Mendelson, & White, 2001). Intentions and attitudes towards weight-loss were measured with a 7-point Likert-type scale inspired by the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen & Fishbein, 2000) and showed good reliability (<i>α<\/i><sub>intentions<\/sub> = .94, <i>α<\/i><sub>attitudes<\/sub> = .95).<br />Discussion<br />The PROCESS Macro model 6 was used to test the serial mediation effects involving two mediators (Hayes, 2017). The results were presented in Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5.  As a whole, appearance-related social comparison and appearance-esteem did mediate the link between exposure to model pictures with varying attractiveness and men’s weight-loss intentions and attitudes, respectively. Furthermore, weight-related social comparison and weight-esteem also mediated the link between exposure to model pictures with varying weight and men’s weight-loss intentions and attitudes, respectively. Theoretically, this study showed that the exposure effect of model portrayals could only affect men’s weight-loss intentions and attitudes through social comparisons with others, which then may be followed by fluctuations in their body esteem. Social comparisons and self-esteem serve as two serial mediators in the process. Practically, the results may be used to design messages promoting positive body-esteem and body image.\n","Abstract Body: Individuals with single sided deafness (SSD) face communication and social challenges post diagnosis. This qualitative study uses semi-structured interviews to identify these challenges that SSD patients face, especially regarding patient's family and medical network. Fifty-two single-sided deaf patients from all over the world participated in semi-structured interviews. Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using a thematic analysis approach. Patients with single sided deafness identified challenges including: increased reliance on family members, decreased sense of autonomy, communication quality changes with family members, information discrepancy across family members and various emotional responses, conflicting information from interactions with multiple medical professionals, and lack of knowledge regarding what to anticipate post diagnosis. This study provides insights into patients’ perspectives around single-sided deafness and its challenges, and the various health care approaches (e.g., patient- and family-centered care, third party disability, patient navigation) that could be implemented post diagnosis to decrease negative experiences and outcomes associated with SSD. This study has practical implications for improving our understanding of what single-sided deaf patients need and for health professionals to offer better care to current and future populations impacted by single-sided deafness.\n","Abstract Body: Hong Kong is facing a severe mental health problem (Sum, 2018), and local young adults aged from 18 to 29 are at the highest risk to depression (Ng, 2018). However, young adults are often reluctant to engage in mental health promotion behaviors due to perceived stigma against mental illness (Chang, 2008; Clement et al., 2015). Previous research has found that attitudes mediated the effects of stigma against mental illness on counseling seeking (e.g., Vogel, Wade, & Hackler, 2007). However, according to the theory of planned behavior (TPB), besides attitudes, three other psychosocial factors, including descriptive norms, injunctive norms, and self-efficacy are proximal predictors of behavioral intention as well (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010). To extend previous research on mental illness stigma, we aim to investigate how the TPB variables mediate the effects of the stigma on the intentions to perform two mental health promotion behaviors: seeking counseling and engaging in self-help methods.<br />In collaboration with the university’s Counselling and Development Center in a large university in Hong Kong, we invited all registered students to an online survey. The depression symptoms were assessed using the depression scale from the short Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). The sample of the current study includes 528 participants who were with median to severe depression symptoms that require professional help. Among them, 77.8% are female (<i>n<\/i>= 411) and the average age was 21.5 (<i>SD<\/i>= 2.52) years old. The IRB approved the research procedure and questionnaire. Table 1 reported Means, SDs, and reliability values of the study variables, as well as the correlation matrix.<br />As showed in Figure 1, the structural equation modeling (SEM) results showed that, for seeking counseling, public stigma was positively associated with self-stigma (β = .37, <i>p <\/i>< .001). Self-stigma was negatively associated with attitudes (β = -.15, p < .01) and injunctive norms (β = -.34, p < .001) but not with descriptive norms or self-efficacy. Next, attitudes (β = .29, p < .001), descriptive norms (β = .15, p < .001), and self-efficacy (β = .27, p < .001) significantly associated with intention to seek counseling. For engaging in self-help, the results showed that public stigma was positively associated with self-stigma (β = .37, <i>p <\/i>< .001), which in turn was negatively associated with attitudes (β = -.22, <i>p <\/i>< .001), descriptive norms (β = -.12, <i>p <\/i>< .05), and injunctive norms (β = -.27, <i>p <\/i>< .001), but was not with self-efficacy. Attitudes (β = .17,<i>p <\/i>< .001), descriptive norms (β = .15, <i>p <\/i>< .001), and self-efficacy (β = .31, <i>p <\/i>< .001) significantly associated with intention of self-help (See Figure 2).<br />Collectively, we found that the effect of mental illness stigma on seeking counseling was mainly mediated by attitudes, whereas the effect on self-help was mediated by attitudes and descriptive norms. Self-stigma against mental illness has been found to decrease individuals’ self-esteem and sense of self-identity, which makes them more sensitive to the surrounding’s prevalent behavior (Hardiman, & Segal, 2003). Compared to counseling seeking, self-help methods, such as healthy eating and exercising, are relatively public behaviors in nature, thus being easily observed by others and subjective to the influence of descriptive norms. This might explain why descriptive norms mediate only the effect on self-help behavior. To sum up, this study examined the mediating roles of the TPB variables in the relations of mental illness stigma and two mental health promotion behaviors, which provided theoretical implications and practical applications to promote mental health promotion behaviors among depressed young adults.\n","Abstract Body: Hong Kong faces a serious cancer problem with a predicted increment rate of 35% by 2030 in cancer incidence (Center for Health Protection, 2019). However, cancer is preventable with individual as well as collective efforts (World Health Organization, 2017). The sociopsychological determinants for individuals’ cancer prevention behaviors have been well documented, whereas antecedents of individuals’ engagement in collective actions for cancer prevention remain understudied.<br />Scholars have suggested that societal or collective level of threat and efficacy should be applied in the context of social risks and are able to promote collective behaviors (Roberto, Goodall, & Witte, 2009). In the current study, we aimed to extend the risk perception attitude framework (RPA; Rimal & Real, 2003) to a societal level by examining how Hong Kong citizen’s perceived societal risk to cancer and collective efficacy of preventing cancer affect their intentions to engage in collective actions for cancer prevention. In addition, we also aimed to investigated how cancer fatalism interacts with perceived societal threat and collective efficacy in forming the intention.<br />We conducted an online survey with 1,005 Hong Kong citizens without cancer history, who were recruited via quota sampling (see Table 1). As presented in Table 2, we measured perceived societal threat, collective efficacy (Rimal & Real, 2003) and cancer fatalism (Niederdeppe & Levy, 2007). The intention to engage in collective actions for cancer prevention was measured using three items: 1) donating to cancer charities; 2) volunteering to cancer organizations; and 3) supporting cancer prevention public policies (Smith, Ferrara, & Witte, 2007). Age, gender, education level, and income were controlled in analyses.<br />As presented in Table 3 and Figure 1, the regression results showed that societal threat ( = .09, <i>p<\/i> < .01) and collective efficacy ( = .33, <i>p<\/i> < .001) were positively associated with the intention to engage in the collective actions. In addition, the three-way interaction fatalism × societal threat × collective efficacy was significant ( = -.07, <i>p<\/i> < .05). To further interpret this interaction effect, we recorded cancer fatalism into three levels: high (+1SD), moderate, low (-1SD). We found a significant societal threat × collective efficacy interaction only among those with high fatalism (β = -.20, <i>p<\/i> < .05), but not among two other groups. In details, for individuals with high cancer fatalism, collective efficacy was positively related to the intention when societal threat was low ( = .55, <i>p<\/i> < .05), but not for high societal threat ( = .04, <i>p<\/i>= .87).<br />Collectively, we found that perceived societal threat and collective efficacy were significant predictors for engaging in collection actions for cancer prevention, which indicated that the RPA can be extended to the societal level. In addition, although the RPA suggests that individuals are most likely to engage in preventive behaviors when both perceived threat and efficacy are high (Rimal & Real 2003), we found that individuals with high fatalism were more likely to engage in collective actions only when they perceived low societal threat but high collective efficacy. In other words, high societal threat combined with high fatalism might vanish the effects of collective efficacy on intention, as suggested by the extended parallel processing model that maladaptive behavior occurs when threat exceeds efficacy (Witte, 1992, 1994). In conclusion, we found that societal threat and collective efficacy motivated collective actions for cancer prevention and high cancer fatalism impeded individuals’ engagement in such collective actions, which extends previous research on the RPA and cancer fatalism as well as provides practical implications to promote cancer prevention in Hong Kong.\n","Abstract Body: Cancer has posed a great threat to public health in China in recent years. Building public awareness of cancer prevention through facilitating public engagement in online cancer prevention communication therefore matters. In particular, people’s incidental exposure to cancer-related information when they go online for other purposes has become prevalent. Accordingly, this study aims to explicate how Chinese people’s incidental exposure to cancer-related information on digital media facilitates them to share this information, through unveiling the role of optimistic bias about cancer risk perception and altruism. The results of an online survey (<i>N<\/i>=1000) demonstrated that optimistic bias about cancer risk perception fully mediated the relationship between incidental exposure to cancer-related information and sharing of this information, and the mediating effect was conditioned by altruism. Given the tendency of having optimistic bias about cancer risk perception for the majority of the population, the findings suggest that altruism should be cultivated to facilitate people to share the cancer-related information that they incidentally encounter online, thereby contributing to developing public awareness of cancer prevention.\n","Abstract Body: Healthy eating is a complex concept. While discrete factors affecting food decision-making have been examined, on a more macro level, how individuals process information and make sense of their health message environment remains a knowledge gap. Using the heuristic-systematic model of information processing as a framework, we sought to understand how families in Singapore process health information from health authorities and their environments to shape family food consumption decisions and behaviours. Through semi-structured interviews with ten families (six Chinese, four Malay; n = 24), we found that participants distilled health messages from health authorities and families into heuristics of ideal and acceptable healthy eating respectively. These sometimes aligned, but unique cultural heuristics on healthy eating also emerged. Participants were also observed to arbitrarily apply their own standards to interpret and apply qualitative health messages. These findings can inform the development of more tailored and effective initiatives to encourage healthy eating.\n","Abstract Body: Introduction<br />Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both males and females in the United States. Specifically, less than one in five individuals (18.6%) who are diagnosed with lung cancer will reach a five-year survival point (American Lung Association, 2018). In 2015, the Centers for Medicaid Services updated its reimbursement coverage to include low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer for individuals who are eligible after a shared decision-making visit. However, Carter-Harris and colleagues (2016) found a decrease in LCS discussions following this requirement. More recently, an analysis of claims data has shown that screening uptake has remained as low, with only about 5% of eligible individuals obtaining screening (Nishi, Zhou, Kuo, & Goodwin, 2019). This study examines whether there is an association between fatalistic beliefs about cancer, patient-provider interactions, and having had a discussion about lung cancer screening (LCS) with one’s doctor.<br /><br />Method<br />This is a secondary analysis of Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 5, cycle 1 data. The main outcome variable, having a discussion about LCS with a doctor, is measured with one dichotomous item. Key independent variables include six Likert-type fatalistic beliefs about cancer items and seven Likert-type items about patient-provider interactions in the past year. Control variables include demographics, smoking status and health-related items, and ease of finding health information. The descriptive analyses were conducted in SPSS v.24 and the hierarchical logistic regression was completed using AM Statistical Software in order to account for the sampling weight and stratum (please see HINTS 5, Cycle 1 Methodology Report, 2017 for detailed information about the sampling design).<br /><br />Results<br />In order to better reflect guidelines for LCS (American Cancer Society, 2019), only participants who were between 55 and 80 years old and had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes were included in the analyses. Participants who had previously been diagnosed with lung cancer were excluded from this study, resulting in a final sample size of 131. A summary of the study’s descriptive statistics and correlations between variables is included in Table 1.<br /><br />.After controlling for the factors listed above, the results show a negative association between feeling as though one’s emotions were addressed by the HCP and having had a LCS discussion (β = -2.06, SE = 1.00, <i>p<\/i> = 0.041) and being involved in decisions as much as desired (β = -2.97, SE = 1.06, <i>p<\/i> = 0.006). Conversely, there is a positive association between agreement with “I feel like I understood next steps to take care of my health” and having had a discussion about LCS (β = 4.61, SE = 1.61, <i>p<\/i> = 0.005.<br /><br />Discussion<br />This secondary analysis of HINTS data highlights the importance of patients understanding what they need to do to take care of their health in relation to LCS discussions. Despite the limitation of not being able to assess LCS eligibility and the final behavioral outcome, this study adds to the literature regarding factors associated with LCS discussions. This is important due to the shared decision-making prerequisite for LCS reimbursement. Specifically, a discussion about LCS is an essential step in the LCS process. Thus, this analysis provides insight regarding patient-provider interactions (navigating patients’ feelings and decision involvement in a way that contributes to better patient outcomes, and making sure patients understanding what to do as a next step) that may lead to more patients having this fundamental discussion. Moving forward, this research can help inform interventions for both providers and patients regarding LCS discussions with the aim of increasing LCS uptake and adherence at the population level.\n","Abstract Body: One innovative approach toward addressing community-level food access is nexus analysis (Scollon & Scollon, 2004). This framework suggests that social actions do not happen outside of context, but rather are embedded within unique political, cultural and economic histories. In this paper, I conduct a case study analysis of the South Memphis Farmers Market (SMFM), a community-based farmers market located in South Memphis, TN. Findings from the study draw attention to how food practices become deeply ingrained in experiences, not only at the individual level but among certain cultural and social groups.\n","Abstract Body: This study explores the effectiveness of a specific type of obesity prevention message that targets Native American adults. This study investigated the ways in which obesity prevention messages that target a specific population may elicit their anger and, in turn, influence message processing outcomes. A total of 118 Native American members of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes were recruited from August 16<sup> <\/sup>to September 1, 2019. A 2 × 2 × 2 mixed experimental design was used to answer a total of fifteen hypotheses were proposed to examine the effects of such message attributes on message processing outcomes (message attitudes, source evaluations, and behavioral intentions) as well as their indirect effects via two mediators (anger-related negative emotions on message sources and obesity attributions). Outcomes, implications, limitations, and suggestions are discussed based on theories and the study’s context.\n","Abstract Body: Ambient air pollution is a major public health concern, causing over four million premature deaths annually through respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses (WHO. 2019). Continued exposure puts children, elderly, and those with chronic health conditions at greater risks. The burden of air pollution is not evenly shared: residents of urban areas and the economically disadvantaged face heightened exposure to air pollutants (EPA, 2019). When air quality levels reach unhealthy levels, individuals are expected to work proactively to protect themselves through a series of activities such as checking air pollution forecasts, avoid exercising outdoors, using less energy, or joining grassroot movements. Therefore, individuals’ willingness to engage with preventative behavior has been subject to many risk perception studies. Common predictors of air pollution risk perceptions have emerged as residential characteristics (Brody et al., 2004; Crowe, 1968; Hunter et al., 2004), socio-demographics factors (Deguel et al., 2012; Laws et al., 2015), vulnerability (Hunter et al., 2004, Shin et al., 2019); environmental knowledge (Johnson, 2011; Li et al., 2016), and family health experiences (Johnson, 2012; Li et al., 2016).<br /><br />Many of these studies, however, approach air pollution as a “single unified risk” (Zhou et al., 2016, p. 1506) despite multiple risk sources (mobile, stationary, area, and natural sources) contributing to air pollution. Here, we examine subtle variations in risk perceptions by analyzing perceived threa<i>t<\/i> and self-protectiv<i>e<\/i> behavior against 13 common air pollution sources in the Northern Nevada region, one of the most polluted areas in the U.S. (ALA, 2018). We then test the selected variables of protection motivation theory (PMT) to evaluate the predictive power of perceived threat on three types of behaviors: information-seeking, pollution mitigation, and self-protective (Figure 1).<br /><br />(Figure 1)<br /><br />Accordingly, we form the following hypotheses:<br /><br />H1: Perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, and perceived self-efficacy positively influence the intentions to seek air quality data.<br />H2: Perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, and perceived self-efficacy positively influence the intentions to engage with pollution mitigation behavior.<br />H3: Perceived threat positively influences self-protective behavior.<br />H4: Race (Hispanic) acts as moderating variables when predicting intentions.<br />H5: Perceived severity of different air pollution sources influences perceived threat.<br />H6: Perceived severity of different air pollution sources influences self-protective behavior.<br /><br />Materials and Methods<br /><br />Using quota sampling, we surveyed 325 individuals from Northern Nevada in March 2019 via Qualtrics Internet Panel. Sample characteristics mimic the U.S. Census estimates (Table 1).<br /><br />(Table 1)<br /><br />Zero-order correlations among each variable confirm the theoretical relationships outlined by PMT.<br /><br />(Table 2)<br /><br />Initial analyses showed wildfires and cars as the largest perceived contributors of air pollution.<br /><br />(Table 3)<br /><br />Follow-up analysis will include obtaining the component scores to look at the dimensionality of the 13 air pollution sources. We will then regress <i>sources <\/i>of air pollution onto <i>perceived threat<\/i> and <i>self-protective behavior<\/i> and in a hierarchical regression analysis, test the conceptual model by regressing the exogenous variables (three threat factors and self-efficacy), and the moderating effect of race (Hispanic) onto <i>information seeking behavior<\/i> and <i>pollution mitigation behavior<\/i>.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Identifying which pollution sources trigger threat factors helps communicators provide occupation and location-specific health messages, discourages the use of oversimplified evaluation of air quality (i.e. poor air quality <i>vs.<\/i> poor quality due to high traffic volume), and provides effective secondary prevention guidelines. Additionally, identifying the relationship between intentions and vulnerability factors (family health status, recurring symptoms, and chronic inflammatory diseases) explains which specific at-risk populations do not take preventative measures to reduce exposure. Implications of conveying mitigation behavior information and the moderating effect of race will be discussed from an environmental health literacy and environmental justice standpoint.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Objectives: Based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Communication Theory of Identity (CTI), this study examines how elder people’s age identity gaps moderate the relationship between perceived social norms and intention to take preventive actions in uncertain health risk situations.<br /><br />Background:<br />In prediction of behavior, the TPB posits that the relative importance of attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control varies across situations (Ajzen, 1991). Under uncertain situations, social norms become more influential in guiding behaviors (Raven & Rubin, 1976; Cialdini, 2001). For example, Kim et al. (2015) found descriptive norm was more influential on intention of performing high (vs. low) scientifically uncertain health behaviors. When people rely more on social norms under uncertainty, the motivation to comply with social norms affects the norm-intention relationship (Fishbein & Cappella, 2006). Age identity gaps may affect elders’ motivation to comply with social norms. According to the CTI, personal-relational identity gap refers to the gap between how people view themselves (i.e., personal age identity) and their perception of how others view them (i.e., relational age identity) (Jung & Hecht, 2004). This personal-relational age identity gap (PRAIG) can be operationalized as relational age identity minus personal age identity. Minichiello et al. (2000) found that elders do not want to be viewed as old and some elders want to prove their autonomy of aging by maintaining physical health. Therefore, we hypothesize that PRAIG moderates the effect of injunctive norm (H1a) and descriptive norm (H1b) on behavioral intention in highly uncertain situations, in that the larger the gap, the less effect social norms have on intention.<br /><br />We also examine the gap between actual and personal age as actual-personal age identity gap (APAIG), operationalized as people’s personal age minus their biological age. The self-perception of being youthful can result in resisting or trivializing recommended disease prevention behaviors (Verger et al., 2018). Therefore, we hypothesize that APAIG moderates the effects of injunctive norm (H2a) and descriptive norm (H2b) on behavioral intention in highly uncertain situations, in that the larger the gap, the more effect social norms have on intention.<br /><br />Methods: This study used a part of a larger online experimental study that randomly assigned 319 participants into high or low uncertainty condition through MTurk. In the low uncertainty condition, participants were present an article about flu which includes risks of flu and recommended preventive actions. In the high uncertainty condition, the same risk information and recommendation were provided for a fictitious disease, “pollonomy.” The hypotheses were tested with 104 elder participants who are at least 55 years old (see demographics in Table 1).<br /><br />Results: The effects of injunctive norm and descriptive norm on intention were moderated by PRAIG and APAIG only in the high uncertainty condition. Specifically, in the high uncertainty condition, as elder people feel they are older than their actual age, they are more likely to follow injunctive norm (H1a) and descriptive norm (H1b) to perform health behaviors. In addition, as elder people feel other people think they are older than their personal age, they are less likely to follow injunctive norm (H2a) and descriptive norm (H2b) to perform health behaviors. However, age identity gaps do not moderate the effect of social norms on behavioral intentions when uncertainty is low (Table 2).<br /><br />Conclusion and Contribution: Elders are vulnerable population of emerging health risks. This study is also the first to examine the moderating role of age identity gaps in norm-intention relationship. The findings provide insights that norm-based campaigns on unfamiliar health risks may not always work for elders because their age identity gaps may hinder them from complying with these norms.<br />\n","Abstract Body: With a growing interest in health, people can conveniently use health-related contents through various channels. However, research about information processing has focused on those who have already been exposed to diseases (Braun & Niederdeppe, 2012; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993; Griffin, Dunwoody, & Neuwirth, 1999). Thus, it is meaningful to investigate how those who are not at risk gain health information. We use the risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model to investigate whether risk perception can lead to risk prevention behaviors. According to the model, an individual's information seeking process consists of the personality factors, motivational factors (risk perception, affective response, and information insufficiency), and information seeking (Griffin, et al., 2008; 1999; Yang, Aloe, & Feeley, 2014). When Griffin et al. (1999) proposed this model, they pointed out that communicative forces such as media use should lead to actual preventive behaviors. Some researchers examined an extended RISP model including health behavioral intention. For example, investigating the roles of consumer’s information seeking behaviors, Jun (2012) found that searching behaviors were positively related to actual purchase of performing arts. Based on the previous findings, this study aims to examine whether information seeking can affect preventive behavioral intention. Breast cancer is known to be directly linked to early detection and cure (Azaiza, & Cohen, 2006). However, South Korean researchers have chiefly explored the patient's treatment compliance, not the preventive action (Jeon, 2013). Thus, this study can address this research gap.<br />  Data were collected from an online survey panel owned by a Korean research firm in October of 2017, and the sample size was 679 (only female respondents). Prior to verifying the hypothesis, we performed confirmatory factor analysis using AMOS 18 software. All of the following indices indicated a fairly acceptable fit: RMSEA (.07), GFI (.91), IFI (.95), TLI (.93), and CFI (.94). The chi-square statistic for this model was 679.94 (df = 138, p < .001).<br />  To examine the proposed information-processing pathways associated with behavioral intention, we performed structural equation modeling using AMOS. The fit indices of the proposed final model indicated an acceptable fit: RMSEA (.07), IFI (.94), TLI (.92), and CFI (.94). The chi-square statistic for this model was 817.85 (df = 171, p < .001). As shown in Figure 1, most of the predicted paths were statistically significant in the hypothesized direction. First, risk perception was significantly increased negative response to risk (H1). Second, negative affective response was significantly and positively related to information insufficiency (H2a), while informational subjective norm was not significantly related to information insufficiency (H2b). Third, negative response, subjective norm, and information insufficiency were positively associated with the information seeking behavior (H3a/b/c). Finally, Information seeking had a positive effect on health behavior (H4). <br />  The bootstrapping was conducted to identify the indirect effects of risk perception on behavioral intentions through mediators such as affective response, insufficiency, and information seeking. As shown in Table 1, risk perception had a significant effect on behavioral intention through mediators, confirming that the extended model is effective (RQ1).<br />  This study can make several unique contributions to RISP studies. First, it is meaningful that this study extends the RISP model including preventive behavioral intention. In particular, it is noteworthy that we have actually analyzed the early proposals that information seeking would lead to behavioral intention. Next, we empirically examined the effects of risk perception and negative affective response on breast cancer in South Korea, where there are only a few studies on the recognition of female cancers, especially breast cancer.\n","Abstract Body: Vaccine non-compliance represents a serious public health risk in the United States. The present study examined the role of descriptive norm perceptions in whether a parent chooses to vaccinate their children on the full recommended vaccine schedule, on a delayed schedule, only with partial compliance to certain vaccines, or no vaccines at all. Participants (<i>n<\/i>=779) were parents of at least one child under the age of 18 residing in the United States. Results suggest that perceived descriptive norms for vaccine compliance are associated with likelihood of membership in each vaccine compliance category. Implications of this finding are that normative messaging may be one avenue for public health campaigns aimed at increasing vaccine compliance.\n","Abstract Body: The Internet has become one of the most important sources of sexually explicit content, yet, research on the prevalence of cybersex and psychosocial consequences connected to it is still relatively scarce. First empirical findings show negative effects of excessive use of cybersex, raising the question of a potential addictive behavioral pattern. Our empirical study addresses this question by applying the DSM-5 criteria to measure Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) to the use of sexually explicit content online. We use a representative sample (N=1,019) of German Internet users (14-64 years). By employing a comparable and well-established measurement tool as well as representative data we hope to illuminate the relationship between a potential cybersex disorder (CSD) and broader health problems, overcoming limitations of previous studies. Our results show that CSD is related to broader health problems (e.g. depression, sleep disturbances) in a similar way as other media-related disorders. Furthermore, we identified a group of 3.4% disordered users among the 468 participants that used cybersex content at least sometimes.\n","Abstract Body: In this study, we are investigating the relationship between time series of five primary emotions (anger, sadness, disgust, fear, joy), spread by different groups of users (bots or humans), with different political ideologies (Democrat or Republican), outside electoral periods. Namely, we examine the online conversations that take place during two politically charged and divisive incidents, the Kavanaugh hearings and the release of Mueller Report. Both events attracted high levels of public attention and generated active partisan debates on social media, providing ideal conditions for examining potential bot influence on users’ expressed emotions.<br />\n","Abstract Body: <br />Social Appearance Anxiety (SAA), perceived by individuals when others evaluate them in terms of physical appearance, can affect adolescents’ well-being.  Literature highlights the protective role of self-esteem and social closeness in decreasing SAA. In accordance with Seiffge-Krenke’s model, these internal and external factors contribute to the development of coping strategies that can be adaptive (e.g., problem solving, benefit finding, perspective taking) or maladaptive (e.g., rumination, self-blame). The aim of the present study is to investigate the longitudinal relationship between self-esteem, social closeness, and SAA by considering the partially mediating role of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies, in a sample of 1085 early adolescents.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Homelessness in the United States has increased each year since 2016. Issues of housing security – from housing affordability to homelessness – are topics firmly planted on the contemporary public and political agenda, often framed as “a crisis.” Despite the function of news coverage and framing in shaping public opinion and policy about social and economic issues, there is a gap in contemporary peer-reviewed research about housing security, homelessness and gentrification. Following framing theory, we completed a content analysis of print news coverage relating to issues of housing security in the 12 top-circulation print news outlets in the U.S. in 2018, which include the cities and states with the highest current rates of, or recent increases in, homelessness. Our data reveal that contemporary news portraits fail to connect the intertwined connections between rent and housing costs, gentrification, and homelessness; largely do not include the stories and voices of individual people who live with the daily stress of housing insecurity; and reveal distorted – often racialized – demographic portraits linking homeless to criminality.\n","Abstract Body: Recent horrendous right-wing terrorist attacks in Christchurch and El Paso renew the discussion of whether right-wing attacks are reported more favorably than Islamist attacks by Western media. Previous case studies have shown that perpetrator identity (Islamists or right-wing attackers) and media type (Western or non-Western media) can shape terrorism coverage. However, the current study is the first one to show how attacks perpetrated by Islamist and right-wing attackers are reported differently in the news by studying multiple attack types in multiple outlets across the world. It is based on a validated, automated content analysis of 12,656 articles about 43 attacks in both Western and non-Western English-language media outlets. As compared to non-Western outlets, Western media reported right-wing attacks with lesser usage of words related to terrorism. In addition, right-wing attacks are reported more negatively than Islamist attacks in general, but more positively in Western media. This study confirms the double standard of many media when reporting attacks by perpetrators with different identities. A greater standardization of the coverage patterns between Islamist and right-wing attacks seems warranted.<br />\n","Abstract Body: There are two influential works regarding comparative media systems: <i>Four Theories of the Press<\/i> by Siebert, Peterson, and Schramm, published in 1956 and <i>Comparing Media Systems: Three models of media and politics<\/i>, by Hallin and Mancini and published in 2004. Both of the two studies focus on the nation-state and the countries in the West. However, Meng and Ratanen in 2015 proposed three new approached from an “East vs. East” paradigm to study media system in countries outside the West. This paper looks at the media systems in Japan and China in the paradigm of East vs. East and tries to examine the efficiency of the three approaches. As a result, this paper found that the East vs. East paradigm and the three approaches cannot fully explain the different media systems in China and Japan. Instead, international relations, professionalism, culture, and relationship between the state and the press as other important variables which should be considered as well.\n","Abstract Body: Previous research on the depiction of scientific results has mainly focused on single issues, coverage of quality newspapers or newspapers in general, and the accuracy of media reports compared to statistics in the scientific literature. In this quantitative content analysis we take both quality and tabloid press news articles on scientific studies into account. The analysis covers multiple issues and topics. Based on a random sample of German and Swiss newspaper articles, we analyzed the depiction of any epistemic and ontological uncertainties. More than 90 percent of press coverage of scientific studies reported on contains nothing but descriptive statistics. More sophisticated forms of scientific results are mostly absent. Notably, quality newspapers put more emphasis on epistemic and ontological uncertainties of scientific findings than tabloid newspapers. In light of the findings, we discuss implications of possible perception biases among the newspaper audiences stemming from the identified reporting standards.\n","Abstract Body: The study addresses a concern over the quality of online news reader comments. Specifically, it examines how online reader comments contribute to deliberation from the cognitive and interactive perspectives. The results of content analyzing, both qualitatively and quantitatively, comments from an online publication <i>The Diplomat <\/i>suggest that comments were mostly deliberative and serious, and they were more neutrally oriented than degrading in terms of feeling expressions. There was some association between reasoning and feelings but not very strong. The study concludes that comment fields can be a good platform for participatory journalism and enrich deliberation on issues. <br />\n","Abstract Body: Abstract<br />The rise of citizen journalism (CJ) into the media sphere has sparked interesting scholarly debates about its credibility and legitimacy. Extant research have majorly studied audience assessment of citizen journalism and social media information, while only a handful of studies have focused on journalists’ evaluations. This paper adopts the Hierarchy of Influences as a theoretical template to investigate the influences of several personal and professional factors on journalists’ perceptions of citizen journalism credibility. This research is contextualised in Nigeria to investigate the phenomenon in an environment with a distinctly dissimilar political, economic and cultural landscape to the countries of prior research. Analyses of data from a sample survey of Nigerian journalists reveal several interesting findings. Individual level factors and routine level factors were found to exert predictive influence on journalists’ perception of citizen journalism credibility, while organisational level influences were found to be non-significant to journalists’ assessment of citizen journalism credibility.\n","Abstract Body: Through a content analysis of media representations of different social groups in Hong Kong news media from 2010 to 2018, this study explored the practice of linguistic border by the media. Two theories, linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) and border as method, were borrowed to describe how the news media include and exclude certain social groups. The results found that social group, social class, crime reporting and gender all have significant influences on language abstraction in Hong Kong news media. Concretely, LIB is not observed in the descriptions of new immigrants while LIB is widely confirmed in other issues, such as social class, crime reporting and gender. Therefore, we argue that certain groups are included or excluded by the news media through the practice of linguistic border. On the one hand, news media is including new immigrants into the local society as there was not significant difference on language abstraction level between negative description and positive description. On the other hand, the media is also excluding lower class from the upper class as the former ones have received more abstract descriptions than the latter ones.\n","Abstract Body: Previous research has tried to understand the extent to which structural characteristics of media organizations and specific media outlets in which journalists operate can explain differences in media diversity. Based on a content analysis of 16,281 news stories from Chilean TV, radio, print, online media and twitter, this study examines whether differences in media diversity remain stable when comparing different types of media platforms for a single medium.<br />The data shows that both the media outlet and the medium significantly influence the presence of source diversity. While the results prevent us from categorically supporting either of the competing hypotheses, the data tend to give more support to the influence of the different affordances and of the particular logic that each media platform develops.\n","Abstract Body: This study analyzed 50 years of the <i>New York Times<\/i>’ international news (N = 20,765) alongside U.S. foreign aid allocations. Data show that nations receiving the highest level of aid also receive the most news coverage and that topics of coverage focus significantly more on politics, conflict and diplomacy. If high levels of aid signal economic and strategic American interests, data support a pattern of news coverage following aid (as opposed to the inverse).\n","Abstract Body: The present study examines loyal readers (N=451) and non-subscribers (N=501) of an American local newspaper. We demonstrate that paths of news exposure to community participation diverge among different audience groups. Connectivity with the newspaper shows more direct and stronger linkages for loyal readers than non-subscribers. Most significantly, we find that civic knowledge is not a crucial predictor for participation behaviors such as volunteering, religious activities, and boycotting.\n","Abstract Body: This research sought to explore the impact of ownership on innovations in American newspaper newsrooms by constructing a Structural Equation Model (SEM). The study, using an online survey (N=1,063), found social media triggers a paradigm shift – public ownership news organizations excel in social media innovations and create more social media friendly innovations milieus than private ownership news organizations. Journalists from public ownership news organizations engage with audiences more on social media than private ownership news organizations.\n","Abstract Body: One of the main challenges facing news websites is to sustain revenue streams that allow for the costly endeavor of producing quality news stories while remaining editorially independent. Recent developments in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia have attested that news websites have been experimenting with various kinds of journalistic writings, digital technologies, and digital marketing strategies and tactics, and in doing so seem to be losing ground to PR journalism and sponsored content. This paper investigates the extent to which four “born on the Internet,” news websites abide by quality journalism while maintaining sustainable revenue streams in the context of increasing platformization of digital news production. This paper uses qualitative document analysis (QDA) to systematically analyze the contents of a representative sample from four news websites, examining a total of 350 news stories. The critical areas of analysis are derived from two of Scheuer’s (2008) three imperatives of quality journalism: the moral imperative of truth and the intellectual imperative of context, and a combination of Wardle’s (2017) and Newman’s (2018) typologies of information disorder.The findings show that the type of journalism the four websites produce consists primarily of a mix of PR and sponsored content, fabricated content, and poor journalism. This dismal picture is the result of several factors including the fierce competition over audience attention, the logic of algorithm-driven platforms, and the integration of the editorial, marketing, and analytics functions in the digital news industry. <br />\n","Abstract Body: <i>An extensive literature argues that the contemporary working class has largely disappeared from the news media. To analyse what characterises mediated representations of work life, labour and the working classes, the present article zooms in on the media coverage of two traditional working class sectors — the construction sector and the care sector — in legacy newspapers and the trade union press. Based on a systematic, quantitative content analysis, this article analyses the coverage over a period of 20 years (1996/7-2016/7) with an emphasis on salience, topical emphasis and voice. It finds a steady decline in media coverage throughout the period, indicating that coverage of work life and workers as part of a routine news beat is dwindling. Thematically, the analysis shows that labour coverage has gone from more informative coverage on workers right and working conditions to a stronger emphasis on work conflicts, recruitment problems and a lack of status for working class craftsmanship.<\/i> <i>In mapping news sources, this article also finds that the coverage of the two working class sectors is elite dominated and that female workers with ethnic minority backgrounds lack a voice in the coverage of their work life.<\/i>\n","Abstract Body: Through the lens of the strategic ritual of emotionality, this qualitative textual analysis provides a thorough evaluation of how news coverage of sex trafficking reflects the U.S. Department of State’s 3P framework of prevention, prosecution, protection and partnership—which serves as the fundamental framework around the world to combat human trafficking. This study evaluates articles published in three of the top-circulated newspapers in the U.S.—<i>USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times—<\/i>from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2018 to answer the following research question: How has media representation of the U.S. State Department’s 3P framework employed the strategic ritual of emotionality in coverage of sex trafficking since the establishment of the Palermo Protocol and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act in 2000?\n","Abstract Body: This paper investigates how Chinese international students in Australia might rediscover their English communication abilities and develop new ones through using English in a participatory and creative self-representation activity. We look at the digital storytelling project with the <i>Stay<\/i> theme carried out for Chinese international students of an Australian university, which involved teaching them to make high-quality videos about personal experience in informal multicultural workshops. Drawing on the sociolinguistic theory of translanguaging and the methods of participant observation and interview, we have obtained the following findings: (1) Before the workshop, the construction of English superiority in study, job hunting and daily life caused Chinese students to suppress, deny and abandon their abilities in language and communication and hence undermined the advantage of cross-cultural experience for study abroad; (2) During the workshop, Chinese student were more confident and able of self-articulation and self-expression in English as they (re)gained social, intercultural and linguistic abilities and knowledge. We argue that digital storytelling constituted an alternative language experience that Australian higher education and ethnic community fail to provide. The individuated and embodied digital authorship of Chinese international students formed resistance to the prevalent language deficiency discourse that makes non-native English use a stigmatising experience. We also point out the potentiality for digital storytelling to become a form of English teaching for EAL (English as Additional Language) international students in English-speaking countries.\n","Abstract Body: Corporate leader messages posted by senior management play a pivotal role in building relationships with stakeholders in the professional corporate communication context and such messages often explicitly or implicitly draw on prior texts to establish credibility and deliver corporate identity. However, research on the linguistic manifestations of intertextuality in corporate leader messages has been limited. This mixed methods study seeks to analyse how intertextuality is manifested linguistically through the types of intertextual links, sources of reference and move structure in leaders’ messages of Fortune Global 500 corporations in the United States and People’s Republic of China. The findings indicate that intertextuality is a prevalent feature of leader messages with intertextual references made to published corporate information using indirect speech. Striking cross-cultural observations are noted since corporations in the PRC often draw on direct quotes in messages whereas indirect quotes and recognisable industry/business-specific phrasing are preferred by corporations from the US. In addition, intertextuality in leaders’ messages reveals ideological variations in that leaders from corporations in the PRC make explicit intertextual references to texts on government policies and business achievements/recognition. Moreover, how intertextuality as manifested in the messages and move structure is driven by the goals of corporations from different cultures. This interdisciplinary study is the first that contributes to the understanding of intertextual practices in the corporate leader’s message, which is of relevance to scholars and practitioners in corporate communication and public relations. <br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This project is a collaboration between researchers investigating religious environmentalism.  We engage with the Ethnography of Communication (EC) and Cultural Discourse Analysis (CuDA) to look at the intersection of religious and environmental discourses using transnational data, coming from Brazil and the United States. The research investigates the role of communication in ecocultural discourses about human-nature relations in different Christian groups. Through EC and CuDA, the researchers identify a shared ecocultural discourse that is based on the radiant of relating as a Christian way of speaking about the environment. Relating is exemplified by different relationships that exist between humans, God, other animals, and the planet-- all connecting inherently to a belief system that is communicatively shared by Christians. This paper will compare how these discourses are invoked in both Brazil and the United States, offering a transnational perspective on the relationship between religion and the environment.\n","Abstract Body: Half a decade after Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of the coming of the promised land for the black race, Janelle Monáe released her third studio album <i>Dirty Computer<\/i>. Echoing King’s quest for racial equality, Monáe’s album underscores the continuing racial barriers and discrimination shaping the lives of black Americans. Yet, her aspirations are broader in scope and encompass a call for racial justice alongside a demand for the total liberation of sexuality and gender. In a so-called emotion picture accompanying her studio album, Monáe takes the viewer to a futuristic totalitarian surveillance state. Here, non-conformity is punished by the forced removal of memories and, thus, the erasure of counterculture identities. The album is a tribute to blackness, to womanhood, to non-conformity and queerness. Breaking with the stereotypical portrayal of sexuality as binary experiences, <i>Dirty Computer<\/i> highlights the complexities of being a queer black woman, even in a futuristic state. This paper seeks to explore the representation of queer black women in Monáe’s emotion picture <i>Dirty Computer<\/i> that accompanied her 2018 album release of the same name. Centering on black queerness, the emotion picture is the first of its kind and delves into issues of otherness, accommodation, hyper-sexualization of the female body, and resistance to white patriarchy. The paper will situate <i>Dirty Computer<\/i> within black feminist thought and particularly draw on the writings of Audre Lorde, to examine the multi-faceted forms of oppression queer black women experience, and how this intersectionality is conveyed in Monáe’s work.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning are arguably one of the most at-risk groups for mental health conditions in the United States. LGB adults in the U.S. are twice as likely as heterosexual adults to experience a mental health condition. Critical to the mental health and safety of LGBTQ individuals is a general acceptance and normalization of their sexual orientation and gender identity from one’s friends, family, and community. The current research proposal attempts to identify the impact of positive role models (Gillig & Murphy, 2014) on YouTube on the identity development of users. More specifically, we will examine the impact of “Coming Out” videos from YouTube influencers on the identity development and coming-out meaning-making of YouTube users utilizing natural language processing (sentiment analysis). While the preliminary analyses presented are are promising, the computational results of this work presented a number of issues centered around algorithmic bias, such as an inability to recognize nuanced cultural language, and general algorithmic inaccuracy, possibly attributed to lack of reliable data associating affect with LGBTQ+ words.\n","Abstract Body: This research examines how individual socio-demographic characteristics, such as gender and age, and familiar, cultural and economic conditions are intertwined with news consumption habits in audiences’ daily lives in a context of dramatic circulation decline. We drew on data from two complementary sources: a survey of news, technology, and entertainment consumption conducted in the greater Buenos Aires area (N = 700), and one-hundred-and-fifty-eight semi-structured interviews. Building on cultural consumption and gender studies as conceptual frameworks, our findings indicate that although news consumption in general appears to be evenly distributed in Argentina, with no significant gaps according to age, gender, education and socioeconomic status, print newspaper consumption appears to be the preserve of older, more affluent, males. Besides, the habit of reading newspaper is formed by family traditions in which men have a central role, deciding what newspaper gets to the home based on their preferences, traditions and class, thus perpetuating existing social differences. Finally, we suggest that the practice of reading news in print is tied to a gender and social class habitus which equates printed information with a crystallization of their duties as a citizen.<br />\n","Abstract Body: In this essay, I argue that The CW’s sci-fi teen drama, <i>The 100<\/i>, functions rhetorically to assuage guilt about America’s colonial past by presenting a disguised colonial narrative, projecting an imaginary of survival, fostering identification with colonizers, and exploiting the segmented and episodic nature of television. My analysis draws heavily from Kent Ono’s theorization of (neo)colonialism in contemporary media culture. I call for the continued identification of colonialism in media with an aim to develop a lexicon of mechanisms by which media represses remnants of colonialism that surface within it. I also call for further study of the medium of television, and how its material and aesthetic dimensions affect the rhetoric its shows offer.\n","Abstract Body: The study investigates respondents’ perception of the negative effects of US drama binge watching on the respondents’ own cultural values as compared with its perceived effects on the cultural values of others. The study aids in understanding the extent to which UAE Arab residents perceive media imperialist influence upon themselves, especially as compared with others. The study examines both the perceptual and behavioral components of The Third Person Effect (TPE) in relation to binge TV watching. Cultural background traits (individualism and collectivism) are studied as an intervening variable. The author constructed an online questionnaire to collect data from 257 UAE Arab residences. The results showed that UAE binge US Drama watchers tend to perceive the effects of binge watching as more positive for themselves than on other people. In other words, UAE binge US drama watchers tend to perceive the potential negative influences of US drama to exist more for others than for themselves. The finding was the same even for TV drama perceived as violent. The results also showed that the presence of individualist vs collectivist cultural tendency did not have a significant impact with respect to the workings of TPE. The perceptual component of TPE was proved, while the behavioral component was not significant.\n","Abstract Body: Within the field of Communications media researchers working from a social-science based paradigm, like mass communication, and humanities paradigm, critical media studies, often study the same object but have little cross-subfield communication. This paper argues that a new approach to mixing methods, Critical Content Analysis, facilitates the adoption of key methodological features from social-science media research, p the use of numerical data, by Critical Media Scholars. While accounting for logistical and paradigmatic difficulties emerging from conflicting theoretical assumptions. I argue that some elements of traditional quantitative content analysis are conceptually incompatible with many Critical Media Studies’ research questions and propose a new methodological approach that allows critical media studies scholars to use numbers to track and illustrate phenomena occurring within a specific text or to identify and record changes occurring over time. This approach will also make Critical Media work more useful and legible to media researchers in other sub-fields.\n","Abstract Body: The influence of presumed influence hypothesis (IPI) describes the processes through which mass media indirectly influences people’s behavior by shaping perception of media effects on other people. This study aims to further explore the IPI hypothesis by investigating the role of interpersonal communication in the mechanism, because social norms is a core element of the IPI hypothesis and perceived social norms are easily shared and modified by communication with others. First, we examine the role of interpersonal communication in the mechanism. Second, we test the indirect ways in which mass media influences behavioral intention for college students who are susceptible to peer norms. This study adopts mass media message that promote HIV test and the effect on intention to have HIV test among college students. We found that talking about media messages, which is motivated by perceived media influence on others, amplified the indirect impact of mass media on behavior for those who perceive less impact of mass media about HIV test on peers. However, as expected, presumed media influence has no effect for those who already have frequently talk about HIV test with others.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The third-person hypothesis (TPH) posits that viewers presume greater influence of negative media content on others (i.e., the third persons) than on themselves. This accounts for the perceptual component of the TPH. Scholars have employed the notions of naïve social scientists and persuasive press inference to explain this component. The TPH also posits that following the development of the self-other perceptual gap, people would carry out protective actions in an attempt to reduce negative media impact; these actions have been conceptualized as the behavioral component of the TPH. Research in the TPH has examined several categories of outcomes that follow the perceptual component, namely the preventive, corrective and supportive actions that are traditionally subsumed under the behavioral component. This paper put forth a theoretical argument for the examination of interpersonal discussion as a mediating factor between the perceptual and behavioral components. This paper introduced the concepts of moral panic and moral entrepreneur to establish the relationship between the presumed media influence and interpersonal discussion. Drawing upon theories of deliberation, this paper explicated interpersonal discussion into two dimensions: vertical instrumental deliberation and horizontal instrumental deliberation. Overall, this paper aims to advance the theorization of the TPH.<br /><br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> third-person hypothesis; interpersonal discussion; vertical instrumental deliberation; horizontal instrumental deliberation\n","Abstract Body: George Gerbner’s Cultivation theory was originally theorized as a macro-level association between television viewing and perceptions of social reality. Using a multilevel modeling approach and data from 27 countries (N= 49,868) from the fifth round of the European Social Survey (ESS), we demonstrate that larger contextual factors can not only account for differences in the outcomes classically measured in cultivation research, but that they can also be associated with differential impact of television on these outcomes. We find that the country one lives in and the welfare state regime present in that country explain a significant amount of the variance in violence related outcome variables as well as in the relationship between television and the outcome variables. We also find some evidence for mainstreaming across welfare-state regimes in the relationship between television watching and reported fear of walking around after dark. We suggest that taking a more macro-level approach to cultivation would provide valuable insight into the complexities of cultivation theory.\n","Abstract Body: In medical care, there is a clear divide and demonstrable bias in the way that men and women are cared for and prescribed medications. Women’s heart health issues go under diagnosed, while men have their mental health issues overlooked. This study aims to determine whether the biases present in medical settings are apparent in medically related prescription drug advertisements.<br />A content analysis was performed to examine this phenomenon. A sample of 360 magazines were examined, with 24 issues of 15 magazines across 3 categories, based upon the publication’s target audience (men’s, women’s and general interest), making the sample. After 1,262 direct-to-consumer (DTC) pharmaceutical advertisements were coded, a notable pattern was uncovered. This study shows a significant bias in regard to which magazines were selected to market DTC prescription drugs, as well as in the sex of characters used. These trends may lead to the continuation of biased diagnoses.\n","Abstract Body: Communication is considered a normative discipline. However, empirical studies on its normative foundations are scarce. We have developed an innovative, multi-step approach to make the discipline’s normative perspectives visible: We identified, systemized, and quantified normative claims consisting of three elements: content (what should happen?), subject (who is responsible?), and object (who benefits?). This concept provides the basis for a long-term content analysis of articles from international peer-reviewed journals in communication (1970-2014). The results prove that communication is and always was a normative discipline, but also show that its subfields differ in their degree of normativity. Moreover, communication scholars formulate many normative expectations of science, but do not seem to feel responsible for their realization. Instead, they hold the media accountable when it comes to ensuring desirable conditions in media and journalism. Based on our results, we call for an informed handling of the normativity that shapes communication and its subfields.\n","Abstract Body: Through a content analysis of news coverage about consumer-misleading advertisings on Baidu search engine by worldwide mainstream media, this study aims to contribute to the growing body of knowledge concerning how journalists describe the world. Working from the philosophy of social constructionism, the study focuses on media discourse to uncover the social reality of search engine ad-fraud in China as perceived and presented by news professionals.\n","Abstract Body: The purpose of this research was to consider how Luce Irigaray’s ideas for developing healthy male-female relationships could be represented in film. The film chosen for analysis was Julie Lopes-Curval’s <i>Toi<\/i> <i>et<\/i> <i>moi<\/i>, which shows how respectful and supportive male behaviour toward a woman can lead to the development of a healthy relationship and how disrespectful behaviour leads toward the opposite. The paper begins by distilling a model for representing healthy relationships in film that is based upon Irigaray and contains four primary ideas. First, for desire to remain, the man and woman must remain two and neither must appropriate the other nor allow appropriation of themselves. Second, each partner must be able to self-affect, which means to have self-respect. Third, the relationship between the man and woman must be reciprocal, and lastly, the man and woman must be special for one another. If the woman moves from an unhealthy to a healthy relationship within the film, her subjectivity should change from one of lower self-affection to one of higher self-affection. For various reasons, she may or may not remain with the man who encouraged her self-affection. Using these ideas, a close reading of <i>Toi<\/i> <i>et<\/i> <i>moi<\/i> was conducted that examined characters, plot, dialogue, settings, and visuals. As demonstrated, <i>Toi<\/i> <i>et<\/i> <i>moi<\/i> provides a productive film for showing how Irigaray’s ideas can be represented in film as each of the two female characters experiences an unhealthy followed by a healthy relationship. The male characters provide role models of both how to and how not to behave toward a woman for a healthy relationship to follow, which is important as there is potential for audiences to learn from film and many people around the world need help in developing healthy relationships. Also, as most films are directed by men and represent relationships from a man’s perspective, it is important to represent relationships from a woman’s perspective as Lopes-Curval has done. Examining a woman’s film may reveal new perspectives and new feminine symbolism. This research could be used by script writers and directors to create other films about healthy relationships and could be used in gender communication classes to study how to cultivate healthy relationships.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Through the theoretical lenses of framing, responsibility attribution and social-ecological model of violence prevention, this study examined Chinese news coverage of violence against medical practitioners using a computer-assisted text mining method. Rather than blaming individuals solely, Chinese newspapers framed causes of and solutions to hospital violence at interpersonal, institutional and societal levels. However, systemic flaws were largely neglected by news media. Compared to commercial press, state-run news agencies are more likely to propose legal solutions.\n","Abstract Body: With the growth of fitness trackers, or fitness applications for mobile media, many actors involved in the development, use and regulation of these devices expressed increased attention to the privacy and control of data gathered through these platforms. This paper explores how government representatives, industry leaders, regulators and politicians discursively constructed and critiqued data privacy in fitness applications in Congressional contexts. Since 2012, there were 314 mentions of “fitness applications” (or “apps”) and “data privacy” in Congressional hearings, testimonies, and House sessions. These mentions are critical points of inquiry for researchers grappling with the ethics of regulation in data privacy. Findings indicate the following discourses: (1) fitness trackers as indicative of larger data collection issues, (2) military implications for fitness application data security, (3) consumers as responsible for their own data privacy, (4) organizations failing to keep pace with cyber security threats, and (5) the misuse of data collected in fitness applications for promotion/strategic communication uses. This paper provides quotes and examples from the dataset to highlight discursive patterns and insights. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the policy debates surrounding data privacy on fitness applications in Congress. This analysis holds three foci: (1) describe various regulatory perspectives on fitness applications and data privacy, (2) describe changes and the evolution of discourses from 2012-2019, and (3) reflect on the ethical arguments presented in Congressional debates and discussions.\n","Abstract Body: Social capital has been identified as a major factor in the survival and growth of a new venture. Despite many calls, we still have limited understanding on how social capital is formed in general or in the entrepreneurial context in specific. The literature on entrepreneurial ecosystems has not yet explored incubators as foci in and around which entrepreneurs form social capital. Addressing these knowledge gaps, this research conceptualizes social capital formation as networked serendipity, which entails a process of performing networking repertoires in and around foci through participating in formal or informal groups and events that facilitate the creation and mobilization of ties between and among entrepreneurs and other stakeholders. Networked serendipity helps to capture the duality of the structural and serendipitous aspects of social capital formation as a joint product of network reproduction and potential changes. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth interviews of entrepreneurs in the mobile technology and media industry, our results show incubators and digital platforms as important foci where entrepreneurs form social capital as well as the process and variations of network serendipity by entrepreneurs’ business experience and stage.\n","Abstract Body: The Egyptian media have witnessed various changes in the ownership spectrum after the 2011 revolution. This study examines ownership concentration in the current Egyptian media sphere by mapping media outlets and their owners. Through the Habermasian lens and by using a mixed-methods approach, three patterns of ownership in the Egyptian media are identified: concentrated state ownership, concentrated private ownership, and not concentrated private ownership. Based on these findings, I argue that the media sphere in Egypt is dominated by a few gatekeepers, mostly the state, that influence content diversity and jeopardize the democratic public sphere in post-revolution Egypt.<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: <br />This paper analyzes the ways that Hollywood and recording studios have begun to renegotiate their business patterns in the post-European Union referendum era. In particular, I focus on two different films that were released in 2018 along with soundtrack albums: a sequel, <i>Mary Poppins Returns<\/i> (Marshall) and a biopic, <i>Bohemian Rhapsody<\/i> (Singer), and analyze the various strategies of self-mythologization that drive the films'<i> <\/i>textual and extra-textual work. These films arrive in an era where London’s future - including its financial status and social landscape - remains uncertain. Yet, both films gesture towards the past in literal, symbolic, and reflexive ways. They both refer to years in which London’s image as a musical city was formed and reformed through: representations of London in musicals; allusions to the city in their respective soundtracks (such as the original <i>Mary Poppins<\/i> (1964)); and performances by rock groups in concert films and televised concerts (such as Live Aid (1985)). At the same time, these films also reference earlier films’ instrumentality in consolidating the synergies between Hollywood, television, and recording industries. Rather than circulating myths regarding London’s musical past in order to displace economic realities, these films reflect both the industrial conditions that shaped them, as well as the contemporaneous political and economic context in which the films themselves are situated. This paper thus eschews Jamesonian “nostalgia” for Thomas Elsaesser’s “feedback:” a concept that accounts for the ways that representations of history are mediated by the institutional histories and commercial practices of their respective spaces of production, distribution, and exhibition, and argues that Hollywood self-regulates by mythologizing its own history. Elsaesser usefully reinterprets previous theories of Hollywood’s mis-en-abyme effect (such as Raymond Bellour’s psychoanalytic inspired theory) by privileging the dialogical relationship between studios and audiences. Thus, rather than speculating on the ways that these films position their audiences, I analyze discourse as it pertains to events that studios mythologize both inside and outside of the text. Like <i>Mary Poppins Returns<\/i> and <i>Bohemian Rhapsody<\/i>, I focus on historical moments that were important for fundamentally changing the industry’s relationship to music: the original <i>Mary Poppins<\/i>, the Live Aid concert of 1985, and “Bohemian Rhapsody” the song.<br /><br /><br />[1] Thomas Elsaesser, <i>The Persistence of Hollywood<\/i> (New York: Routledge, 2012).<br /><br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: Editors occupy a particular role in newsrooms as an arbiter of professional news practice. They are skilled in traditional reporting, but as newsroom managers they are also tasked with negotiating between journalistic goals and organisational objectives. Using the hierarchy of influences model, this paper examines how levels of influence embodied in the editor play out in a changing journalistic environment. Based on interviews with 18 editors of small and mid-sized US newspapers, this paper shows that each level of influence is measured, shaped by, and dependent on the concept of community. In other words, editors find meaning in their work by viewing their newsrooms not just as in service of readers, but as being embedded in the community. This paper puts forth the concept of community as a subject of renewed interest in journalism scholarship.\n","Abstract Body: The development of China's Internet, especially its global expansion, has attracted great attention in recent years. Several scholars have analyzed the globalization of China's Internet from the perspective of the interactions between the government and Internet companies. However, few studies have been conducted at the company-level, and the mechanisms of government participation in the internationalization of Internet companies is still in a “black box”. Drawing on institutional theory, this study explored mechanisms of government participation in the internationalization of Chinese Internet companies from two dimensions of internal involvement and external incentives on the basis of data on Chinese Internet listed companies between 2009 and 2018. The results indicated that internal government involvement could expand these companies’ international geographic scope but had a restraining function on their international performance, while external government incentives had no significant direct impact on their international development. However, further analysis showed that external government incentives could moderate the relationship between internal government involvement and Internet companies’ international geographic scope. By revealing these relationships, this study is helpful to understand the governmental influence in the globalization of China’s Internet, and is also of reference value for the Chinese government to effectively allocate resources and formulate industrial policies to push Internet companies to go abroad.\n","Abstract Body: In recent years social media use has plateaud or even declined in many countries. A possible explanation is that users have become better aware of their screen time and the potential negative effects associated with social media use. This study draws on 30 in-depth interviews with current and past social media users aged 21-39, to gain a better understanding of young people’s experiences with social media disconnection in relation to their wellbeing. We find that many experience an ambiguous relationship with social media and their smartphone. They recognized that social media had clear benefits and opened up new possibilities for social connection, information gathering, entertainment, but at the same time, they were not satisfied with their use or even experienced negative effects for their everyday life and wellbeing. Most participants felt overall better by limiting their social media use or by disconnecting altogether, although some struggled to do so. Overall, young people continuously rethink their relationship with social media, striving to balance their social media use in a way that fits with their life. This raises further questions on how to equip people with the adequate skills to healthily embed social media into their lives, and attain digital wellbeing.\n",null,"Abstract Body: In the last two decades, mobile games have proliferated, with players worldwide devoting significant time and money to their chosen practices. In many cases, online groups of players have coalesced around such games, sharing personal experiences, strategies, and other related contributions. Such communities represent exemplary examples of competitive communities of practices, leveraging the competing forces of cooperation and competition to foster in-group solidarity and motivate members to further engage with the game and community alike. However, minimal research has examined the nature of the discussions among members of a competitive community of practice, nor how the conversation evolves as the community matures. In this study, the authors use latent Dirichlet allocation to model the topics of conversation made on the r/grandorder subreddit, a competitive community of practice devoted to the mobile game <i>Fate/Grand Order<\/i>, across two million posts and comments made during a three-year period, as well as the ways in which the representation of those topics evolved over time. 20 distinct topics emerged spanning different topical foci and emotional tones. The prevalence of certain topics, such as those related to gacha game mechanics, declined as community members developed mastery of the practice and no longer needed to engage in extensive sensemaking around it. Future studies should build upon this research to compare the structure and evolution of conversations across contexts, and they should likewise examine differences that emerge in discourse due to the relative balance of internal competition, external competition, and cooperation within the competitive community of practice.\n","Abstract Body: It is common for individuals to consume and share news via mobile messaging applications nowadays. Since not all news messages are necessarily attached to a source, this study aims to find out how audiences evaluate the exact same WhatsApp news message when attributed to different sources, particularly regarding the fakeness of news content. In an online experiment in June 2019, 280 participants were exposed to a news message in favor of the extradition bill opponents in Hong Kong, it was found that the source of the news did not affect the perceived news fakeness. However, the findings suggest that participants holding opposing stances on the controversy perceived the exact same news message as fake to significantly different degrees. This study contributes not only to mobile communication but also to hostile media perceptions and media literacy research in the face of the rise of disinformation.\n","Abstract Body: The gap between citizens and politics is often addressed in terms of the declining trust in governments. Reason for the Dutch government to ask consecutive advisory commissions for recommendations to improve their practices of communication. What these committees have in common is the advice to take listening far more seriously as the essential counterpart of governmental voice. Despite following up on these recommendations by implementing various listening practices, more governmental listening to citizens apparently did not bridge the gap. During a two-year qualitative research project we investigated the moves towards listening and public engagement. In this paper, we outline how listening practices actually work in everyday policymaking processes and processes of public communication, and why it has not sufficiently contributed to bridging the gap between citizens and politics. We conclude that rather than as a means of facilitating citizens’ voice, listening has been predominantly practiced to enhance the voice of the government. We argue how listening within policymaking organizations can only contribute to bridging the gap when the focus of listening practices shifts from opinion mining and interest groups to citizens’ and civil servants’ own experiences and expertise.\n","Abstract Body: This study examined internal dissent and external whistleblowing, two constructs studied extensively as individual concepts but not in tandem. Participants were given one of four scenarios based on a 2 (high unethical vs. low unethical case) × 2 (high leader integrity vs. low leader integrity) experimental design to test their whistleblowing and dissent intentions. Results indicated that leader integrity influences an employee’s level of internal dissent intentions, with ethics having a statistically significant effect on external whistleblowing intentions when controlling for managerial position and organizational tenure. Future research should continue exploring whistleblowing and internal dissent tendencies in organizational settings. <br />\n","Abstract Body: <br /><br />Gig workers comprise an increasingly large percent of the workforce in modern organizations. The purpose of this study is to examine knowledge sharing behavior and attempts by organizations to exert control over contract workers. The study conducted a case study on Uber and Lyft drivers who share knowledge via Facebook online communities. The knowledge sharing behavior and knowledge seeking behavior were examined through a qualitative content analysis of key themes within the communities. The findings from this study underscore the ways in which contract workers actively share and enhance community knowledge through online discussion. Further, there is clear evidence of both organizational attempts to control workers, and work attempts to gain back individual control through their online discussions. This research points to online communities as an important component of contract worker life, and also underscore the ways in which contract workers are developing a rich body of knowledge is external to the parent organization.\n","Abstract Body: Favorable coworker relationships are linked to employees’ higher level of job-related performance. With a general basis of Saks and Gruman’s socialization resources theory, we proposed and tested mediation pathways linking two types of socialization resources (multiple media use for social interaction, and workplace friendship opportunity) to employee flourishing and organizational commitment, mediated by coworker friendship inside and outside the organizational settings. By using a survey of 504 full-time workers in two Chinese cities, Xiamen and Quanzhou, this study found that both the use of multiple media for social interaction and workplace friendship opportunity facilitated by the organization can strengthen coworker friendships, which in turn exerted a positive influence on employee flourishing and organizational commitment.\n","Abstract Body: This project explores how team resilience enacted in the work domain shapes and is shaped by resilience practices in the non-work domain—a process we label, <i>domain diffusion of team resilience<\/i>. Weather forecasters’ professional, organizational, and team work gives rise to a resilient mentality, which then tends to manifest in their own non-work contexts. Qualitative data collected from a National Weather Service (NWS) forecaster team revealed that a strain created by a U.S. Government shutdown, which resulting in a five-week stoppage in compensation, was absorbed with minor disruption to both team (work) and family (non-work) functioning. This study is the first of its kind to draw upon high-reliability team (HRT) and organization (HRO) theory (Weick & Sutcliffe, 2007) as well as the communicative theory of resilience (CTR; Buzzanell, 2010) in order to describe the diffusion of resilience across domains. Implications for cross-boundary theorizing of resilience conclude the paper.\n","Abstract Body: Based on the social constructionist approach and the “syllogism of <i>apologia<\/i>”, the paper argues that a counterattack of the accused during crisis communication is argumentatively successful if it can construct different images of both the accuser and the accused as opposed to the constructions by the accuser through establishing the stasis of fact (denial of the charges and counterattack) and a stasis of quality (a defense for the image of the company).<br />To support this thesis, the paper first introduces the social constructionist approach to crisis communication; second, the paper elaborates on the syllogism of apologia, its connection to crisis responses strategies, and the use of counterattack; and finally, the paper uses a case study method to analyze the <i>kategoria<\/i> of the U.S. government and the counterattack of Huawei.<br />\n","Abstract Body: In this article, I argue that communication studies, in particularly those focussing on big data and macro studies using quantative methods can make use of articulation theory to assist them in nuancing, grounding or situating their research. I do this by taking platform studies as an example to show what articulation could do in this new context. Articulation theory, originally devised in the context of cultural in the sixties and seventies envisions society as existing in a constant flux of articulations, which constitute a present ‘normal’. This article hopes to contribute towards a larger role of contextualization and nuance in the field of platform studies by drawing on a classical theory in cultural studies and applying it in a digital context.\n","Abstract Body: The original transportation theory is out of date and the extensions should be incorporated into the communication field.  In order to keep up with the changing times, the theory needs to include several extensions and revisions that can incorporate new and emerging media.  The following integrative review will seek to address gaps from the original theory, make claims about the extensions needed for transportation theory, provide support for those claims by means of case study, develop core principles for the new extended version of transportation theory and provide initial insight on limitations towards the extended transportation theory.  Currently transportation theory claims to consist of a narrative that enacts a belief, attitude, or behavior change.  Claims for the extended version revolve around expanding this narrative into new media and associated message forms which will be the two new components that comprise of a narrative.  Support is given through two case studies for each medium resulting in eight case studies.  The principles given at the end of the paper are to be used to conduct research to test the extensions of transportation theory. <br />\n","Abstract Body: <br />Communication infrastructure theory has been used to explain the communication-related conditions that contribute to civic engagement in diverse urban environments. Research has shown that connections to neighborhood storytellers (residents, community organizations, local/ethnic media) who tell stories about the neighborhood, is positively associated with civic engagement. Less is known about the specific communication action context factors that enable or constrain neighborhood storytelling and those that are associated with civic engagement. This study uses a survey of 398 randomly selected households in historically lower income African American neighborhoods to explore how physical (walkability features, presence of parks), psychological (perceptions of crime), and technological (perceptions of public transportation) features of the communication action context are related to connections to a neighborhood storytelling network, neighborhood belonging, and collective efficacy.\n","Abstract Body: Based on theoretical model from spiral of silence theory, this study adapts and explores two key constructs of influencing variables: fears, and congruency with opinion climates that chill or encourage expression on Chinese social media Weibo as well as in face-to-face setting about the issue of same-sex marriage legalization. Results suggest that fear of abusive attack aroused from the immediate context of social media, rather than trait-based fear of social isolation can make an impact. It directly harms social media and face-to-face opinion expression and can indirectly affect face-to-face expression through social media expression. This finding indicates the potential to propose more forms of fears in researches, especially closely related to the social media context. Opinion congruency with friends on social media and in face-to-face setting respectively encourages expression in each setting and friends on social media could affect face-to-face expression through social media expression. The importance of friends as the reference group is notable. Opinions of governments and news agencies still play a role. Congruency with their accounts’ opinions on social media directly prevents face-to-face expression.\n","Abstract Body: Extant literature has yet to fully investigate how the audience responds to news stories that contain false information. The current project examined audience response to a diplomatic event through an ideological lens as well as general political knowledge and source credibility perception, guided by the news framing construct and persuasion knowledge model. A between-subject experiment with two factual accuracy conditions (Factual vs. Partially Factual) and two news source conditions (CNN vs. Fox News) was conducted. Findings suggest that CNN is regarded as a more credible news source than Fox News; perceived political knowledge is more in line with a partially factual story. Results also show that news source credibility, information quality and perceived political knowledge significantly impact information trust in the story. Political ideology and news-exposure source preference were found to significantly influence attitude toward the diplomatic event covered in the story, but not general political knowledge.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Many studies have examined the degree to which social media facilitate echo chambers that keep users from diverse political perspectives (Bakshy, Messing, & Adamic, 2015; Parmelee & Bichard, 2012; Zhu, Skoric, & Shen, 2017). The present study expands the debate regarding selective exposure and selective avoidance to political Instagram use. A survey of politically active Instagram users measured how often users expose themselves to opinion-reinforcing political leaders and the extent to which users avoid opinion-challenging leaders. The findings indicate a high level of selective avoidance behavior on Instagram, especially by users who are conservative, Republican, very ideological, and female.\n","Abstract Body: Anecdotal evidence suggests a link between message board websites and the rise of far-right movements, which have achieved growing electoral success globally. To examine this connection, we focus on the far-right Spanish political party Vox and its supporters’ use of the message board <i>ForoCoches<\/i>, a fan site for car enthusiasts which became an important platform for the party. Using a large-scale computational approach, we collected more than 120,000 messages from threads mentioning the party between 2013-2019 and used a mix of network analysis, time series analysis, and link analysis of URLs shared in the messages to show how offline political events and mainstream news media shape the conversation online among a small network of engaged users rather than the other way around. The use of sites such as <i>ForoCoches<\/i> should be viewed in the context of a broader political and media landscape, consistent with hybrid media system scholarship.\n","Abstract Body: Many public and academic debates in the past few years evolved around the positive as well as negative impact of news recommender systems. A crucial aspect in the debate is the degree of user control to interfere with the system. If users are in control of the recommendation process, negative consequences such as unwanted bias are mitigated while positive implications such as heightened involvement and an increase of agency are amplified. In sharp contrast to the normative stances that dominate prominent debates around the societal consequences of news recommender systems, very little empirical research is available that could inform such debates. Further, studies testing news recommender systems so far did mostly (1) not directly compare different personalization strategies with (2) large enough sample sizes, (3) over a longer period of time with repeated interaction, and (4) using surveys in addition to behavioral measures. Our study addresses these four shortcomings with a novel research design. We developed an own news aggregator that allows us to test<br />interactive news recommender systems for a longer period of time. Participants are assigned to four different conditions: Two recommender systems (topic- and similarity based), one customization condition and one random baseline. The news are retrieved from several RSS feeds of different news providers. Thus, the website is intended to resemble a news website in a controlled design. This allows us to better understand how different forms of news personalization are connected to perceived user control and satisfaction with the system.\n","Abstract Body: Will America ever have a woman president? Part of answering that question involves understanding the gender dynamics of campaigning in the United States. Past research has provided substantial evidence of the challenges facing women candidates, including a double bind that requires them to at once perform as competent politicians and fulfill traditionally feminine gender roles, and a backlash effect in which they are seen by voters as either competent or likeable, but not both. Much has been done to assess these dynamics in campaign advertising and speech, but with the rising prevalence of social media as a way for candidates to reach potential voters, more work is needed to identify the strategies candidates use in strictly visual campaign elements, as well as the effects these strategies have on voter perceptions. Our multi-method study fills this gap by observationally assessing the visual personalization strategies of candidates in the 2020 Democratic primary and experimentally evaluating their effectiveness.<br /><br />Through a comprehensive content analysis of the Instagram posts by Democratic primary candidates in 2019, we identify gendered trends in self-presentation strategies, with special attention to how and how often candidates use images to present themselves as professional politicians or humanize themselves as people in various relationships, particularly as caretakers. Then, we use a survey experiment manipulating candidate gender and image type to identify differential effects of personal and political posts by men and women running for office. These paired studies allow us to identify not only gendered differences in visual self-presentation by candidates campaigning for office, but also the differential effects of personal and political posts on voter perception of candidate competence and likeability by gender. As candidates and campaigns increasingly create primarily visual social media materials, our research begins to examine what their effects might be for the candidates, voters, and gender equality in the American political system.\n","Abstract Body: Much of the existing knowledge about the populist communication style emerges from a fast-growing research examining parties’ manifestoes, politicians’ speeches, and communication over social media. More recent studies have also highlighted the importance of examining candidates’ communication style and people’s response on social media in real time during key election events, such as presidential debates (Shah et al., 2016; Bucy et al., 2019). We contribute to this research agenda by examining communication style of Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen during the 2017 French presidential debate, paying particular attention to populist elements of these exchange. We coded the content of the debates to account for character attacks, verbal nonfluencies, as well as use of blame and anger language. In addition, we rely on an original Twitter dataset containing 900,000 tweets of the French public in order to examine citizens’ response during the debate. Our results show striking similarities between the two presidential candidates during the presidential debates, suggesting that populist style might be contagious and also employed by mainstream candidates when interacting with traditionally populist politicians. Yet, social media users were able to distinguish between populist and mainstream candidates in their social media responses: while Le Pen received less attention and more negativity, Macron attracted more attention and more positivity while employing elements of populist communication style.\n","Abstract Body: Fewer than 70 pages of scholarly research have been published on Congressional press secretaries—despite these individuals’ influence on the United States Congress’ communication systems and, by extension, the country’s democracy.  Collectively, for the first time, this paper summarizes selective insights from “the literature” to help to unravel the phenomenon the press secretaries represent.  Doing so it summarizes the only three studies to date in which the press secretaries have served as units of analysis (Downes 1997; Hess 1991; Cook 1984).  Noting the importance of the press secretaries’ work “building relationships” with reporters et. al it provides a wide-ranging, kaleidoscopic overview of insights selected from a variety of scholars’ writings that speaks to the roles, motivations, and potential influences of this unique group of political communicators.<br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: In this paper we assessed the qualities of German mainstream online news outlets, online tabloids, local online news and pro- and contra-refugee counter-publics to find out about their contribution to the overall public debate on refugee policy. We used manual and dictionary based quantitative content analysis to assess who gets to talk in these publics and whether standards of politeness and civility are maintained, and used topic modelling to assess whether counter-publics and local news enhance the spectrum of topics present within the public sphere. We find that the German online publics mostly conform to the standards of representative liberal theories of democracy, with the mainstream covering a broad range of topics that is not enhanced by other publics, and dominated by elite actors. From a deliberative perspective, the presence of civil society actors in the mainstream public is advantageous, but the low civility and lack of distinct distributions from counter-publics disappoints. From an agonistic perspective, regular citizens and marginalized groups are relatively rare within mainstream coverage, which counter-publics surprisingly do not remedy.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines public evaluation of and responses to opinion polls when the results are cited by politicians on social media to uphold their personal views. Building on research from motivated reasoning and persuasion literature, our study shows that politician uptake of poll results in a persuasive context makes people more attentive to pollster brand names as heuristic cues. Moreover, there is a significant three-way interaction: while attribution to highly reputable pollsters makes a poll more credible and influential among hostile audiences who hold unfavorable views towards the politician, unspecific reference to “a recent poll” creates greater room for motivated reasoning and partisan biases among friendly audiences. Importantly, poll quality evaluation provides a vehicle for hostile audience to resist the influence of the poll on issue attitude and opinion climate perception, particularly when high-reputation pollster cues are absent. <br />\n","Abstract Body: In the era of electronic media, the development of dark ads marks an epochal shift in the ability to micro-target in real time on a mass scale. New challenges have emerged as a result of the automated forms of customisation and targeting that are now available particularly around their potential to influence election campaigns. In the wake of public concern about targeted political messaging, this paper takes as a starting point the need to develop a system for addressing the transformation of advertising form the visible economic glue of commercial media, to an increasingly and ubiquitous form of invisible culture.\n","Abstract Body: In this paper we examine how popular media positions dating and hookup app use as a social problem that impacts on health and wellbeing. We also identify a significant category of supportive discussions of app use - focused on pleasure and playfulness - within social news and lifestyle reporting. The paper adopts a mixed-methods media studies approach to create and analyse a dataset of over 6,000 international news articles published within a 12 month period. Our analysis does not seek to discount the value of popular media discourse as an influence in health research and public health agendas. On the contrary, we suggest that media content featuring first-person accounts of app-use can provide valuable insights into 'vernacular pedagogies' or peer-to-peer learning within digital cultures.<br /><br /><br />\n","Abstract Body: This research studies the phenomenon of Bollywood-induced tourism by focussing on one of its most important components- Bollywood music videos. Both Bollywood cinema, and popular Indian music to a large extent is dominated by Bollywood music. With high production values, these songs are an integral part of the films, are consumed as standalone entertainment, and function as points of promotion for the films. Increasingly, the music-video format also generates footfall to the locations shown therein. This study investigates the role and significance of <i>filmi<\/i> songs for the tourism industry. Employing 19 in-depth interviews with primarily tourists, but also various stakeholders in the business of film-tourism, this study attempts to understand what impact Bollywood songs have on travel motivations of its audiences and to what extent-if at all- the experience of the tourist is different than other forms of film-tourism. This is put into perspective by zooming in on the contemporary case of the song <i>‘Gerua’ (<\/i>Saffron)<i> <\/i>from the film Dilwale (2015) which was instrumental in tripling Indian audiences traveling to Iceland since its year of release. Additionally, Qualitative content analysis of the music video is conducted to supplement the interview analysis. More in particular, we touch upon the question-to what extent are <i>filmi <\/i>songs instrumental in influencing Bollywood tourism, and in what ways do the film-tourists engage with the <i>filmi<\/i>-song locations?\n","Abstract Body: Using Dunn’s (2006) discursive axes as a foundation for an explanatory mechanism that reveals the latent focus of destination images created by official sources, the projected destination images of Abu Dhabi and Dubai found on YouTube are examined in this paper. Neighboring emirates in the UAE, Dubai is one of the top tourist destinations in the world and Abu Dhabi is one of the fastest growing. Each is striving for a unique destination image that will differentiate it in the marketplace and attract visitors. At the manifest, or explicit level, six of nine attributes are similar in the portrayals of the two destinations. Dubai is shown to be a place where there is more action plus sun, sea and sand. Abu Dhabi is shown to have more opportunity for social experiences with family and friends. At the latent, or implicit level, Dubai is shown to emphasize more pop culture and a more globalized presentation of itself. Abu Dhabi has slightly greater emphasis on folk and high culture and portrays its visitors as travelers more than tourists and interactors rather than isolates. The two destinations are seen as same-same but different rather than being completely different or similar. The implications of these contrasts and similarities are discussed. This mechanism for the analysis of latent content within destination image presentations is valuable for understanding differences and similarities across time and space and can be used in a variety of tourism contexts. Practical uses of this analytical structure and findings are also offered.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Current research on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) communication have focused on examining means and challenges of communicating CSR work. The thrusts have been centered largely on organizations using it as a message-oriented tool to fulfil organizational goals. However, public relations research has struggled to look at CSR communication from a constitutive approach, one which ontologically considers communication as a core foundation, the building block of any organizational entity and organizing process.<br />Embracing a constitutive approach, this study examines how organizations seek a social license to operate via CSR engagement, legitimization formation and aspirational talk in their communication essence, by situationally exploring practices of CSR communication conducted by Hong Kong organizations, where international business is conducted with East-Meets-West culture.<br />Three questions are examined, first, how are the socio-cultural meanings in CSR communication to achieve a social license to operate; second, how is engagement constructed and nurtured in communication; third, how is aspirational talk negotiated and made sense of in CSR-related documents? Employing cultural discourse analysis (CuDA) as method, CSR reports of two out of five CSR award-winning companies have been analyzed.<br />Preliminary results highlighted how these two companies negotiated through the meanings making process when constructing engagement, a license to operate, and conduct aspirational talk in such a culturally rich Asian context.<br />This study, based on a socio-cultural perspective, is innovative as it enlarges our understanding of CSR communication in societies and how that is engendered in a unique East-West culture, the diversity of views, tensions and challenges that are negotiated.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Situated in the context of mass shootings, the present study examined stakeholders’ reactions, including the cognitive evaluations and affective responses, trust and public behavioral intentions toward the national rifle association (NRA) after the Florida Parkland shooting. To test the proposed theoretical model, we conducted a national survey with 603 subjects, who are NRA’s stakeholders living in the U.S. Hypotheses were supported based on the results of structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures, which demonstrated (1) the strong direct effect of cognitive evaluations on publics’ affective responses toward the NRA, (2) the negative direct association between affective responses and public trust, (3) the significant direct effect of public trust on neutral and accommodative behavioral intentions, and (4) the role of affective responses and public trust as significant mediators in the model. The theoretical and practical implications of the study were discussed.<br /><i>Keywords<\/i>: Stakeholders, non-profit organizations, gun shooting, trust, evaluations, affective responses, behavioral intentions\n","Abstract Body: When individuals identify wicked problems such as unfairness or inequity in society, they join social movement groups to advocate for social change. Social media is one advocacy tool that social movements use to amplify their reach. The quality and quantity of social movement social media engagement matter a great deal. Currently, in public relations research, many scholars have equated online interactivity with social media engagement and have used social media engagemen<i>t <\/i>to represent the entire process of engagement. This article fills the gap in the current engagement literature and applies the co-creational approach to the social movement contexts to discuss an alternative way to reconceptualize social movement engagement.\n","Abstract Body: In this article, we draw upon the network paradigm to broaden our understanding of engagement. We see engagement as a multidimensional process that takes place in networks of organizations and publics. In this study we examine how a grassroots movement organization (Sunrise Movement) engaged diverse publics in its promotion of a new public policy (the Green New Deal). We examine the emergence of critical influencers (bridging hubs and Tertius Iungens) and autonomous public communities in the organization’s sphere of influence—defined as the organizations’ ego network with direct connections and contacts that are only one step away from the organization. We also examine how these critical influencers and autonomous public communities engage with each other over time to generate social capital and co-create public discourse.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Coombs (2019) suggested using stories to overcome corporate social responsibility challenges. However, the research on this topic is very limited. This study attempts to fill this gap and introduces the theory of narrative engagement to study the effects of storytelling on one of the key CSR challenges, CSR skepticism.<br /> <br />Based on narrative engagement theory, the study will test the relationship between narrative engagement and two different types of skepticism, dispositional and situational skepticism.<br />Several mediators and moderators are identified.<br /> <br />Specifically, the study uses an experimental design to test (1) whether CSR message in the narrative format vs. non-narrative format will lead to lower levels of CSR situational skepticism and more positive CSR perception; (2) whether dispositional skepticism negatively influences narrative engagement and CSR perception; (3) the mediating role of self-referencing on the effect of narrative on CSR perception; and (4) the moderating role of publics’ involvement with the CSR issue.<br /> <br />Study results can assist practitioners in making more informed decisions on communicating CSR efforts and creating messages that enhance publics’ perception of organizations’ CSR programs.<br /> <br />The study extends the current understandings of the effectiveness of storytelling in CSR communications. Introducing narrative engagement to public relations research opens up opportunities to build theories around engagement-based CSR communications.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Purpose of Research: The current literature regarding organization-public dialogue primarily emphasizes dialogue as an organizational communication <i>orientation<\/i> rather than sequential micro-communicative <i>processes <\/i>cocreated by organizations and publics. It is also unknown how organization-public dialogue affects a web of dialogic relationships, including relationships between an organization and its publics and among these publics. <br />Theoretical Approach: Our study supplements the literature by identifying the dimensions of organization-public dialogue <i>processes <\/i>and examining the effect of organization-public dialogue on the organization community structure (i.e., organization-public dialogic relationships, public-public dialogic relationships, and the relationships’ impact on the organization) in a series of social-mediated networks.<br />Methodology: We analyzed eight brands’ Facebook data from 2017 to 2019 using a mixed method of content analysis (<i>N <\/i>= 8,838) and network analysis ( = 74,969,  = 1,000).<br />Key Findings: Our findings suggest that organization-public dialogue grows an online community around a brand, increases the amount of reciprocal communication between various digital actors, and makes the brand more popular, influential, and well-embedded in a conversational network surrounding the organization.<br />Implications: Social-mediated brand-public dialogue generates business values for brands. To further advance the dialogic paradigm, scholars should develop a valid and reliable measurement of organization-public dialogue in social media.\n","Abstract Body: <i>Purpose of research and research gap: <\/i>Fill a gap in public relations research on employee advocacy by examining internal communicators’ thoughts on how they can influence this type of behavior.<br /><i>Theoretical approach and background: <\/i>This study contributes to the theoretical understanding of the value of public relations by viewing employee advocacy as an outcome of internal communication.<br /><i>Method: <\/i>A qualitative interviewing method was used. 25 public relations and communications practitioners were interviewed. The following research questions were proposed:<br />RQ1: What factors drive employee advocacy?<br />RQ2: How does strategic internal communication influence employee advocacy?<br />RQ2a: What communication strategies do communicators consider most effective to encourage employee advocacy?<br /><i>Key Findings:<\/i> The drivers of employee advocacy can be divided into three factors: individual (i.e., emotions, job attitudes, person-organization, fit, personality, and instrumental value), group (i.e., leader-member relationship and group cohesion), and organizational (i.e., organizational culture, top management, communication management, and socialization). Internal communication can influence employee advocacy through corporate communication strategies (i.e., openness and transparency, positivity, legitimacy and empowerment, and recognition) and employee advocacy management factors (i.e., understand business objectives, policies and guidelines, facilitation, interesting and meaningful content, and collaboration).<br /><i>Practical implications: <\/i>Internal communicators need to be familiar with the individual, group, and organizational factors that motivate advocacy behaviors and work on generating these conditions.<br /><i>Originality and innovation: <\/i>The current study views employee advocacy as the ultimate test of a relationship between an organization and its employees, and therefore proposes employee advocacy as an extended behavioral outcome of internal communication.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Purpose of research and research gap: This study analyzed intermedia agenda-setting in the context of IPOs, a news setting that is considered highly routinized and standardized to shed light on both direct and indirect influence of financial information subsidies on news.<br /><br />Theoretical approach: It applied intermedia agenda setting theory, in combination with the concepts of information subsidies and journalist co-orientation.  <br /><br />Methodology / Research Questions: Automatic content analysis was used to record the salience of different IPO issues (topics) in the press releases for IPOs listed on the main board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and of the subsequent press coverage and online news reports. The relationships among the frequency counts of IPO issues were analyzed using Poisson regression and zero-inflated Poisson regression to figure out the intermedia agenda-setting effects of press releases on financial news in two pathways, from source to media and among news media at different stages of the IPO marketing period.<br /><br />Key findings: The results provide evidence that the press releases influenced the overall news agenda during the early stage of the offering period of new stocks, although for some issues negative or no relationships were found. Overall, the issue salience of the news media in the early stage of IPOs showed significant transfer to the latter stages.<br /><br />Originality and innovation: We examined an understudied aspect about intermedia agenda-setting in IPO news. The data analysis strategy provided a more accurate understanding of the effects of press releases on setting the financial news agenda.  <br />\n","Abstract Body: This study proposes that parasocial interactions—illusory one-way interactions between an audience and media personae—with characters can enhance persuasive effects of entertainment-educational messaging due to altering the perceived norms of those exposed to the specific narrative. An online survey-experiment was conducted in order to observe the extent to which parasocial interactions (PSI) with a professional football player impacts perceived norms, attitude and behavioral intent in the context of concussions. Hierarchical linear regressions were employed to observe if exposure to PSI predicts support for normative perceptions expressed within the narrative while altering attitude perceptions concerning how health outcomes is perceived in the mind of the public. Findings suggest that PSI with a media figure expressing his experience with injury in sports changed various norms alongside perceptions regarding the prevalence of these issues before and after the interaction took place. This change implies increased perception regarding the prevalence of concussions and unhealthy stigma surrounding injuries within the sport of American football.\n","Abstract Body: This analysis of 2,517 tweets from nine NFL teams examined how the size of a team’s following influences the engagement, elements, and hashtags of their tweets, and if these dependent variables also change based upon the time of year. It found significant differences in the types and amounts of hashtags that mid-sized teams produced. Hashtags are used more prolifically during the regular season, though engagement does not change based upon the time of year.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Using a textual and rhetorical analysis of sports-themed parenting books, this paper critically examines these books to understand the construction, meanings, and effects of parenting advice literature that frames parenting through the lens of sports. Crucially, this paper seeks to analyze the specific meanings and understandings that are created when parenting is constructed through the ideological prism of the rigidly gendered, ruthlessly competitive, and uncompromising hierarchical arena of sports. In doing so, it seeks to unpack the ways in which sports-centered parenting discourses do not simply serve as an enticement for men to embrace fatherhood, but actively work to “remasculinize” contemporary parenting by reimagining the meanings and performance of fatherhood according to the conservative logics and ideologies that undergird masculine sport.\n","Abstract Body: <br />This article examines from a critical perspective on memory the rituals and rhetoric utilized in sports amid tragedy when it involves a team member. National and regional tragedies, i.e. 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina, have been studied previously as it pertains to tragic events and sports ritual but not when it occurs to a team hardship itself. Using baseball as a case study for the larger sporting realm, this article offers a rhetorical analysis of the unfortunate events that were used as the basis for narratives of the Vanderbilt, Auburn, and Los Angeles Angels teams during the 2019 season. Employing Carolyn Kitch’s three-stage “transitional ritual” as a guide, sports journalists’ themes were easily categorized into separation, transformation, and aggregation.\n","Abstract Body: Introduction & Theoretical Frameworks<br />This conceptual paper utilises Complexity as an epistemological framework to demonstrate that the reconceptualization of photography as a complex open system provides an effective point of departure for transdisciplinary and innovate visual research. As such, the macro-objective of the paper is to operationalise complexity (specifically the conceptual frameworks of Edgar Morin and Paul Cilliers) to argue against the reductive ontic positivism traditionally applied to photographic discourse (Costello, 2018). This is strategically apprehended within the micro-objective, of “national photographies” (Bleyen & Van Gelder, 2011); in which photographic outputs and techniques are socio-politically organised into nationalised categories. The research hypothesis contends that photographic “visual language”, far from being “universal” (Sekula, 1981), in fact carries exclusive visual sociolinguistic codes that have yet to be adequately explored within scholarship. Specifically, this research posits the notion of regional “photographic dialects” within systems of national photography.<br />As complexity explicitly advocates for the researcher to actively embrace their own presence within research (Morin, 1992), this research is located within the paradigm of Welsh Photography; a community within which I have an explicit social role as a practice-based researcher. As such the methodological design has been conceptualised as complex insider-research, intended to present holistic critical insight into the systemic praxis of photography. This narrowing of the conceptual scope allows for both the manageable apprehension of research aims, and a collaborative approach to data in which research informants dictate the majority of the analytical domains.<br />Much like the ontology of photography itself (Costello, 2018), the exact parameters necessary for the conceptualisation of a “national photography” have been debated (Bleyen & Van Gelder, 2011). As a strategic point of departure, this research initially adopts Bleyen & Van Gelder’s characterization of national photography as a concept “organised around ‘schools’, ‘styles’, towering ‘authors’ that have dominated the scene for years or photographic ‘innovations’ that could be labelled as national.” (p.112). However, the methodological paradigm of complexity adopted by this paper will advance this definition to also consider nationalised visual themes. Further, it will assimilate any other emergent properties of “national photographies” that are identified by research participants. As such, this research will ultimately re-conceptualise national photographies as complex open systems; the study of which will be used to advocate for the ontic reconceptualization of photography itself as a complex system.<br />This conceptual insight will largely be facilitated through the exploration of specific complex “photo-methodologies” employed by photographers to photographically actualise nation-ness. In doing so, this research offers insight into the way in which photographic ontology, historically characterized by positivism and binaries such as subject/object (Costello, 2018), can instead be epistemologically considered as an open complex mode. Necessarily, this is a holistic approach, that assumes neither photograph, camera, nor photographer represent the “full picture” (Azoulay, 2012).<br /><br />Research Questions:<br />The primary research question is predicated on an axiom, legitimised through various sources both individually (usually the photographer themselves) and institutionally (primarily through curatorial modes).<br />Axiom: some photographers focus their photographic practice on heterogenous notions of “Wales” and/or “Welshness” that are both implicit and explicitly identified as such by the photographers themselves.<br />Primary Question: Why do some practitioners choose photography as an apt medium to present and/or discuss their notions regarding the largely phenomenological<sup><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/sup> concept of nation-ness?<br />This question is derived from the way in which the historical conceptualisation of photography as an empirical mode intersects contemporary interpretations of photography as a subjective and creative medium. Its conceptual framework is located within teleology and constructivism. It is geared towards understanding the way in which photographers themselves conceptualise photography.<br />This question provides scope to gather data regarding not just the research environment (photography and Wales/Welshness), but the research theme of photographic ontology.<br /><br />Secondary Questions: The first of these questions is designed to further examine the teleological modality of photography when contextualised within the phenomenological concept of “nation”, and is predicated on the conceptual framework of Kress and van Leeuwen (2006). This framework posits that the choice to privilege one representational mode (photography, for example) over another (such as painting), provides insight into the meaning-maker’s understanding of the criterial aspects of what they aim to represent. To illustrate this, Kress and van Leeuwen offer the example of a child creating a pirate ship from a cardboard box, stating “when children treat a cardboard box as a pirate ship, they do so because they consider the material form (box) an apt medium for the expression of the meaning they have in mind (pirate ship), and because of their conception of the criterial aspects of pirate ships (containment mobility etc)” (Kress and van Leeuwen, p.9). This research argues that gaining greater epistemological insight into the applied conceptualisation of photographic modality will provide scope for an appropriately complex ontology of photography.<br />As such, the focal secondary question is as follows:<br />Which criterial aspects of national identity (specifically perceived notions of “Welshness”), if any, can be found in the medium of photography?<br /><br />Further secondary research questions, presented below, are contingent on the methodological strategies and emergent data supplied by participants. They are subject to change, addition, or exclusion.<br />Based on a holistic approach to data gathered, is it possible to conceive an ontology of photography that provides a complex account of the medium as a visually communicative open system, the ontological values of which might more typically be ascribed by the sociological conditions under which it is produced and disseminated?<br />Do the data make it possible to discern any culture-specific photo-methodologies employed when constructing a photographic representation of a phenomenological concept (nation/identity, for example), that have been designated, either by group or individual, as being teleologically “Welsh” in nature?<br />Is there evidence to suggest that photography, when used to explore themes regarding national identity, is exploited for its established ontological relationship with “proof” and “authenticity”?<br />Can a link then be made between the authenticity claimed by the ontology of photography, and the authenticity claimed by the socio-semiotic approach to photographic meaning-making employed by certain practitioners?<br />Is it possible to discern the presence of thematically resonant aesthetic amongst the visual data?<br />If so is it possible to characterise this aesthetic as either thematic or formal?<br />If so is this registered by any individual informants, or group of informants as being necessarily “Welsh”? I.e. as constituting a Welsh “visual vernacular”?<br />If so, what are the sociocultural conditions in which is this “vernacular” is constructed, articulated, legitimised and maintained? (i.e. what, if any are the inherent power structures within this community, which “signs” of Welshness have become “naturalised” and why?<br />If the adoption of a Welsh photographic dialect is detectable, to what extent is this a conscious effort by photographers?<br />If the effort <i>is<\/i> conscious, why?<br />Are reasons comparable to those relating to authenticity in traditional sociolinguistics?<br />If the effort is unconscious what are some potential influences that might contribute to this system of meaning-making?<br />Are there any significant actual or perceived differences between the visual vernacular of native/inhabitant Welsh photographers and visiting/foreign Welsh photographers?<br />If so, can these differences be understood through the context of linguistic nativism, and how significant has the “outsider” view been on the visual construction of Welshness in contemporary Welsh photography?<br /><br />Methodology:<br />Just as photography has no singular applied methodological paradigm (Costello, 2018), neither does complexity (Loubser, 2014). Complexity, argues Morin, opposes the “methodological recipe” (Da Conceição De Almeida, 2010)and accepts the disorder necessary to foster creativity within research (Montuori & Donnelly, 2013). However, whilst disorder and ambiguity are actively embraced within complexity (Da Conceição De Almeida, 2010), it is also acknowledged they must not <i>characterise<\/i> the method (<i>Ibid<\/i>). As Gear <i>et al<\/i> state, “there is a wide variation in complexity theory application and considerable stretch or fuzziness remains” (Gear, Kozio-Mclain, & Eppel, 2012, p. 2). As such, to mitigate against the random application of disparate methods, Morin posits the notion of methodological <i>program<\/i> - a set of predetermined approaches (classically considered to be the method), and methodological <i>strategy - <\/i>a set of fluid approaches, the implementation of which is contingent on the emergent data and the researcher’s ability to apprehend methodological uncertainty. Indeed, both Morin and Cilliers argue that an initial program <i>must<\/i> be predetermined in order to practically implement methodological strategies; even in emergent methodologies (Morin, 1992; Cilliers, 1998). This section then, accounts for the transdisciplinary methodological program implemented within this research. This takes the form of a mixed-method qualitative approach; informed by a variety of theoretical frameworks including visual studies, ethnography, linguistics, cultural studies, and nationalism studies - all of which have been considered within the epistemological paradigm of complexity.<br />In order to indicate some of the necessary chronology of the proposed methods, the following methods have been separated into two stages; Stage One necessarily precedes and informs Stage Two, however data gathered during Stage Two will determine the treatment of data from Stage One. As such; the methodological design should be considered dynamic, collaborative, and open in its organisation.<br />Stages One and Two of the methodology consist of largely visual methods in the form of participant-curated photography, photo-elicitation interviews, and participant-led visual analysis. These methodological approaches will be driven by “guided conversations”<sup><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/sup> (Drury, 2016)<sup>,<\/sup> informed by - but not prescribed to - ethnographic interviewing techniques.<br />Commensurate with the methodological paradigm of complexity, the lines of inquiry will endeavour to promote a holistic approach to data, and as such will preserve and examine data that appear to represent dissention from research hypotheses. The separation of the ecology of photography into disparate disciplines has arguably led to a fractured understanding of the medium. This methodological design is geared towards deconstructing conventional codes of understanding (promoted by discipline-constrained approaches), and diffusing these fragments within neglected areas of photographic understanding such as individual photo-methodologies, meaningful emotional incentives, and the interaction between group/individual photographer’s organisation of knowledge.<br />Stage One of the applied methodological program is designed to fulfil several practical functions within the overall research system; it will both generate data that is valuable to the research questions, and inform the sampling approach and interview questions in Stage Two, as well as later analytical domains. The primary purpose of Stage One, however, is to open a channel of communication between researcher and participants, and to generate visual resources that act as both research data and research tools. As such, respondents in Stage One will submit image(s) that they feel have been critical in their understanding of the concept of “Welsh Photography”. As this concept is contested (Cabuts, 2012; Crawford, 1984), the question put to respondents will not delineate the notion of “Welsh Photography”. Instead respondents will be able to interpret the concept themselves, and will be given the option to justify their choice of response with a written submission. This too, will generate meaningful data, and will allow for respondents to be active collaborators in the emergent research process. To be included within the sample, participants must themselves be photographers, and must, at some point, have made a body of work that examines notions of Wales or “Welshness”.<br />Stage Two will take the form of face-to-face individual “guided conversations” with c10 informants. The notion of a “guided conversation” is coined by Drury, who describes the method as a “mutual sharing of stories and information … a level of reciprocity, informality and on-going continuity” (2016, p. 81). The conversations themselves will be divided into two halves which, for both practical and theoretical reasons, will run concurrently. The first half of each conversation will take the more traditional form of a photo-elicitation interview. During this segment, informants will be asked to respond to the visual data gathered in Stage One. To maintain the role of participants as collaborators, this segment will be open, but might revert to semi-structured prompts if informants wish; this contingency should be considered as a methodological <i>strategy (Morin, 1992)<\/i>, as opposed to a <i>program (Ibid)<\/i>. The second segment of the guided-conversations will be largely auto-ethnographic. Within this segment, informants will be engaged in dialogue pertaining to their own practice as photographers. The structure of these parts of the conversations, as with the photo-elicitation will be relatively open and the use of semi-structured prompts to guide the conversation should be considered as strategy, rather than program. In both segments of the conversations, the order, content, and structure of the inquiry have been designed to evolve in-line with participants answers. This compliments the complexity design, in so much as it allows the researcher to prioritise the emergent research themes over a rigid approach in which the same line of questioning is dogmatically pursued (Knox & Burkard, 2009).<br /><br /><br />Collaborative Analytical Approaches<br />Whilst there is an overwhelming wealth of scholarship regarding visual analysis, recent research within the field of visual studies advocates for a multidisciplinary approach (Pink, 2003; Van Leeuwen, 2011). Indeed, rigidly applying a single analytical framework arguably prevents meaningful interaction between text and visual data, and dogmatically following a singular analytical framework does not fit within the complexity model. As such, no prescribed analytical framework will be applied to the data gathered. Instead a methodological program of thematic analysis will be adopted, with research participants collaboratively dictating thematic domains. Thematic analysis has been chosen due to the ease of its methodological application within the complexity model applied to this research design. More prescriptive methods of analysis, such as content analysis or narrative analysis tend to have limited methodological variability (Braun & Clarke, 2013) and would this necessitate the kind of “methodological recipe” that both Morin and Cilliers advise against. Castleberry and Nolan state that thematic analysis is a “descriptive method that reduces the data in a flexible way that dovetails with other data analysis methods” (2018, p. 808). In other words, thematic organisation of data can be used to facilitate the transdisciplinary approach favoured by complexity, and advocated for in contemporary visual studies.<br />As Cilliers states, complex systems are open systems consisting of a large number of elements. These elements interact dynamically; interactions are non-linear and constitute the exchange of energy and information. The history of a system is extremely important in determining the behaviour of the system, which can largely be located in the interactions of the system’s elements, as opposed to the elements themselves (2000). As such, the analytical approach will utilise the limited existing scholarship regarding Welsh identity and photography as a point of departure that accounts for the history of the system. Largely (though not universally), this scholarship has identified two key categories within photography and Welsh identity; “landscape and the picturesque”, and “communities and labour” (Cabuts, 2012). Though Welsh Photography in general (and contemporary Welsh Photography in particular) is demonstrably far more heterogenous than this initial binary suggests, twentieth century photography tended to focus on these “two key subjects in Wales” (Cabuts, 2014) and as such, their separation into distinct categories constitutes a cultural phenomenon that warrants investigation.<br /><br />Stage One of this research was launched through an online form on 28.10.19. It runs until 11.10.19. Significant volumes of visual data have already been submitted. It is expected that Stage Two interviews will take place during December 2019, and analysis of findings will be complete by March 2019. Due to the emergent nature of the analytical methods, no initial analysis can be offered at this stage.<br /><br /><br /><sup><sup>[1]<\/sup><\/sup> This notion is predicated on the framework of Benedict Anderson in <i>Imagined Communities<\/i>.<br /><br /><sup><sup>[2]<\/sup><\/sup> This concept is posed by Drury in her doctoral thesis, and represents a reciprocal approach to semi-structured interviews, in which participants are contextualised as collaborators rather than informants. As Drury states, this approach is more commensurate with the paradigm of complexity than the rigid application of semi-structured interviews.\n","Abstract Body: This paper explores Stuart Hall's previous research on film's role in the formation of identity to discuss representative Macao films of the past decade.

As open science can help latecomers realize leapfrog development, current study intends to make these local efforts more visible to others for future improvements of the weak Macao film industry.\n","Abstract Body: With the rise of internet-based digital participatory cultures in India in the past decade, social networks have become sites of volatile political discourse. Like other countries such as Brazil, Turkey and Russia, this has resulted in the widespread eruption of memes in Indian politics. This paper examines humorous politicized memes that are deployed to critique the Hindu-right wing in India. Through an examination of the formal nature of the meme and its connection to other visual forms such as the political caricature, the visual joke and the graphic novel, the author demonstrates how seemingly frivolous objects can hold potential for serious discourse. In doing so, the author also puts forward the concept of “memetic visuality”—a particular mode of imagining the world and the political community through a series of intertextual connections.<br />\n","Abstracts: In the context of a more pictorial political environment (Veneti, Jackson & Lilleker, 2019), with increasing pressure to appeal to swing voters, visual images have a powerful impact on viewers’ attention and retention (Fahmy et al., 2014). This study clearly opens a dialogue in communication research because it bridges a gap in political communication discipline by applying visual social media analysis of online campaigns. Specifically, this research examines how candidates used Instagram to strategically frame their images during the last 2019 general elections in Spain, based on site of production and site of the image itself (Russmann et al, 2019; Rose, 2016). Results are based on a quantitative content analysis of 678 images posted by each of the five main candidates during 28 days, including the precampaign and the campaign periods. The evolution of the political arena in Spain, with the rising of new political parties, has altered the political scenario in terms of vote fragmentation and having more competitive electoral processes, influencing in turn political and communication strategies. Findings reveal the increasing role of the personalization frame as an electoral strategy among candidates in general, but more specifically on professional/political aspects rather than in personal/private contexts. Overall, the work contributes to the growing understanding of Instagram as a tool for campaigning online, and gives some light to appreciate main trends in a relative short election time frame (Quevedo & Portales, 2017; Verón & Pallarés, 2018).\n","Abstracts: The Worlds of Journalism Study (WJS) is the most relevant global project on journalistic cultures in recent years (Hanusch and Hanizsch, 2019). The project is committed to the assumptions of open and collaborative science, for which the data from its first wave were released for free reuse in 2013 and those from the second, very recently, in 2019. This paper presents the first statistical analysis longitudinal and comparative open data released from the first (n = 500, 2007-2011) and second wave (n = 2,041, 2012-2017) of WJS surveys on the profile and working conditions of journalists in Spain, Portugal, Chile, Mexico and Brazil, countries that make up a moderately cohesive cultural region. According to the results, variations in the age of journalists has been a reliable indicator of volatility and media market movements in other longitudinal comparative studies at global and regional levels. It is relevant to note that in Latin America the age of journalists continues to decrease and that, in turn, the youngest are, for the most part, women. A certain reduction in gender differences has also been detected. To this trend are added three factors more related to working conditions: (I) the stability obtained by the most educated journalists and the importance of the university through the requirement of a degree to practice the profession; (II) the decreasing accumulated experience and the lower proportion of fixed-time jobs in favor of part-time or freelance contracts; (III) the strong economic crisis suffered globally and the increase in job insecurity that has led media companies to change their hiring strategies and business models. We conclude that, despite regional differences, the role of women has been revalued, while the working conditions of journalists have been precarious.\n",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Abstracts: In this paper, I reflect upon humanities ‘interfaces’ –– institutions such as the GLAM sector as well as journalism and media. I discuss and link between two recent policy moments in Australia that illuminate opportunities and pitfalls for open communication research.<br />Firstly, I look at the Engagement and Impact Assessment of university research, undertaken by the Australian Research Council in 2019. This revealed the rich contribution of humanities interfaces to opening research to citizen participation and public knowledge; but also shaping contemporary research in the communication fields.<br />Secondly, I discuss the chequered effort over a decade in Australia to fashion an e-research infrastructure for humanities (and social sciences) research. The shaping of digital humanities interfaces is vital, because already much next-generation infrastructure of scholarly research and communication is uncomfortably shaped by commercial digital platforms.\n",null,"Abstracts: Without doubt, the work of the public intellectual in synthesising and popularising the findings of rigorous research has never been more important (Dahlgren, 2012). In this world where fake news conceivably underpins more of the political agenda than informed research (Lazer et al., 2018), the challenge for academics seeking to cut through the clamour and mis-information may appear overwhelming. Yet communication with its longstanding interest in societal interfaces, from the 2-step flow of information and opinion leadership (Katz & Lazarsfeld, 1955) through to networked knowledge-sharing and social capital (Lefebvre et al., 2016), may hold the key by explaining how to harness knowledge champions.

More specifically, the study sets forth to understand how humanizing or dehumanizing a prisoner will influence the approval of solitary confinement when solitary confinement is viewed as upholding fairness or violating care. To test these assumptions, this study will use the model of intuitive morality and exemplars (MIME; Tamborini, 2011 & 2013) and moral disengagement (Bandura, 1999).<br />\n","Abstracts: <br />As research continues to indicate a chasm between new hires’ expectations and what managers are equipped to provide, the current research uses a mixed-methods design to explore vocational anticipatory socialization from the perspective of young adults.

Through a mix of reliable and valid survey instruments and open-ended items, traditionally-aged college students provide insight on how personal factors (i.e., self-efficacy, self-worth, leader identification, etc.) and expressed needs and wants for managerial communication behaviors may influence matriculating nurses' preferences for various approaches to management.

The knowledge these languages embed addresses complex problems such as river health and climate change, storied within the cultural memory of many Australian Aboriginal groups. In this presentation we offer two short West Australian case-studies, the first being Noongar, the multi-dialectal language of the southwest, and the second being Nyikina, one of the eight spoken languages of the Martuwarra Fitzroy River in the Kimberley. Discussions around the value of Aboriginal sciences – in the sense where science is defined as a systematic approach to applying epistemological frameworks – will underpin this presentation. We say sciences because the languages pertain to different nations and bioregions, and carry knowledges specific to each bioregion. The contribution of this presentation to open science is its Aboriginal language perspectives. Noongar people have always known that the climate changes. For instance in Noongar language, nyittiny means the cold or glacial times, along with stories pertaining to this period. However Noongar language does not know a linear, narrow sense of time – where things happened in the past (and slowly become less significant). Rather, there is a concept of ‘always here’, in which kura, yeye, boodawan – past, present and future – are understood in English as a ‘long now’. Therefore together with stories of a different climate, cultural wisdom for ecosystem health are still here today, embedded in language. Nyikina language speakers have always known about river health. A ‘Living Waters, First Law’ approach describes a First Law cultural governance centred on protecting Living Waters and in turn the health and wellbeing of the people and the Country. It enshrines key values and ethics to promote wellbeing and the balance and sacredness of all life. Importantly it recognises that water is a living life force that humans have an obligation to care for in a respectful manner. In this presentation the authors discuss the ways in which Aboriginal sciences as the first sciences of this land, can properly be regarded as ‘science’ according to now global understandings which are usually framed using European languages. Such an inclusion will necessitate that models of performing, checking, communicating and publishing that define science will need to be broadened. Perspectives of the ways in which science is understood and funded in this country are then offered. Aboriginal sciences are critical to the future of this country at this critical point in history, where climate health, the future of water and in fact the ways in which Australians live their lives are threatened.<br /><br />Professor Len Collard is with the School of Indigenous Studies at the University of Western Australia.

Learners are also exposed to accents of English via cultural products, and acquire and embody their social meanings when using English. While the link between attitudes and behaviour is often taken for granted in Sociolinguistics, social-psychological research highlights its tenuous nature. This paper employs the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) (Ajzen 2005) to measure the language attitudes and language use of 71 English-language learners at two Spanish universities.<br />Data were gathered via questionnaire and paired interview. Quantitative data suggest that learners’ use of accent features can be predicted, to an extent, by measuring attitude alongside subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. Quantitative and qualitative data demonstrate that learners draw on the status and solidarity values of accent features – e.g., using RP variants of /t/, /j/ and LOT more frequently and attributing these high status. Use of /r/ did not follow this pattern but was predicted by measures of behavioural intention. Learners’ accent choices were also influenced by factors such as intention to become an English teacher and learner orientation. Notably, learners used features variably rather than adopting any L2 accent wholesale.<br />This paper argues that the TPB can be usefully applied when investigating English-language learners’ attitudes and behaviour. It demonstrates how learners negotiate possible and ideal selves in the L2, and has implications for research into English-mediated identities and native-speaker ideologies.\n","Abstracts: Group salience, an individual’s awareness of group memberships and respective group differences during an intergroup encounter (Harwood, Raman, & Hewstone, 2006), occupies a paradoxical role in intergroup relations. On one hand, group membership must be salient for specific contact to generalize to the outgroup (Brown & Hewstone, 2005). On the other hand, negative contact makes group membership more salient (e.g., Paolini, Harwood, & Rubin, 2010), and thus negative contact may have a greater capacity to increase prejudice than positive contact has to reduce it (Barlow et al., 2012). Guided by communication accommodation theory (Giles, 1973; 2016) and using thematic analysis, the current study examined East Asian international students’ retrospective written account (<i>N<\/i> = 103) about their communication associated with cultural group salience (i.e., made them aware of US versus home culture) in interactions with American host nationals. Findings indicated various conversations topics that activated cultural salience (e.g., sports, foods, jokes, education, and communication styles). Results also revealed accommodative and nonaccommodative communication dimensions of cultural salience used by American host nationals with respect to interpretability and discourse management. Furthermore, findings revealed themes related to participants’ stereotypical perceptions of American host nationals’ characteristics (e.g., being confident, independent, friendly, direct/straightforward, and self-centered). Findings demonstrated the critical roles played by conversation topics, accommodative and nonaccommodative moves and perceived intentions, and cultural stereotypes in intercultural communication between East Asian international students and US host nationals, which are useful in developing interventions that simultaneously enhance cultural salience and positivity in intercultural communication.\n","Abstracts: As an alternative to the orthodox medicine (i.e. western medicine), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has gaining increasing acceptance among patients with chronic illnesses and cancer. There is also a trend to integrate TCM and WM in medical care in different cultures (e.g. mainland China, Hong Kong, and Singapore). While extensive study has been carried out in the field of WM, there is limited researched into TCM that leads to unwarranted speculations. This study aims to bridge the gap by examining patients’ evaluation of doctors’ communication behaviors in different clinical practices. Six doctors (3 from TCM, 3 from WM) and 69 older-adults with chronic diseases participated in the study. The survey used the Relational Communication Scale developed by Burgoon and colleagues (1987). Doctors’ communication styles were measured across six domains (immediacy, similarity, receptivity, composure, formality, and dominance). Instrument reliability and content validity was reported to be high among the 69 patients (α = 0.78 indicating good reliability). Significant differences were observed in patient evaluations in five out of the six domains with medium to large effect size except composure. Put differently, TCM doctors received greater patient satisfaction than their WM cohorts in the five domains of relational communication. The findings also suggested greater global patient satisfaction in TCM than WM consultations (p < 0.01, Z = - 7.01, r = - 0.84). These observations provide empirical evidence to a clinical difference in the communication styles between doctors and patients. The findings reported here could be informative to studies of patient expectations and professional-client communication in cultures where different clinical practices co-exist.\n","Abstracts: Creating understanding is critical to both open science and interdisciplinary research; however, <i>understanding<\/i> is a surprisingly understudied topic in communication research. In this presentation, we discuss how several key topics in the study of language and social psychology (LSP)– culture, communication accommodation, language vitality – fit in a new, working model of how people create understanding in social interaction. This model, which is informed by theoretical and empirical findings from cognitive psychology, linguistics, and neuroscience, defines understanding as a dynamic state of entrainment at multiple mental levels (i.e., cognitive and neural). In short, the model proposes that creating understanding is a process in which people present and observe stimuli to activate mental states via inference-making. When successful, this ultimately results in entraining their mental states with others’. In this presentation, we outline how culture functions as filter that affect stimuli selection, familiarity with stimuli and subsequently, inference-making. This helps explain why miscommunication or misunderstandings occur more frequently in intergroup and intercultural interactions, relative to ingroup and intracultural interactions. We argue that accommodation facilitates understanding by helping communicators account for how stimuli will be processed by others. This, in turn, helps communicators effectively activate the mental states they intend. Finally, we suggest that the degree of institutional support a language receives (one dimension of vitality) may affect the mental states activated by stimuli from that language, as well as related experiences of processing fluency. Through these examples, we highlight the value of LSP to the study of creating understanding.\n","Abstracts: This study aimed to examine two methods of elicitation of identity. The first method was to ask people to write an essay about who they are as a person. This method permitted freedom to define the categories of personhood. A second open-ended method for eliciting identity data was to use the <i>Twenty Statements Test <\/i>(Kuhn & McPartland, 1954). While the <i>TST <\/i>was used in numerous studies, this method has been criticized for the <i>TST<\/i> would cause possible priming of independent traits of identity due to the repetition of the “I am” stem used for elicitation.<br />An open-ended rather than an a priori approach such as a scale might provide some valuable information in understanding identity. Methods intended to measure the same constructs are assumed to provide similar results although measurement equivalence of the different methods were rarely examined. The main question of the current study is whether there is any correspondence between the identity structures obtained in the open-ended spontaneous essays compared to data obtained from the TST. Secondly, the study collected data from Korean and American respondents offered different categories of description of personal and social identity based on the method of elicitation. 600 undergraduate students were participated in this study and the data were examined using network text analyses which provide networks where notes are entities connected by the presence and distribution of the words in the data. The results of this study would provide findings related to measurement equivalence and cross-cultural measurement validity of two methods.\n","Abstracts: Hong Kong is one of the most technologically interconnected regions in the world. Internet access is cheap, readily available and nearly 100% of mobile phones are 'smart phones'. In keeping with global trends and arguments for efficiency and cost-effectiveness, local services and organisations have enthusiastically pursued the development of health and lifestyle tracking mobile apps along with numerous eHealth (including mHealth) technologies. However, as acknowledged in the literature, this rapid digitization of health care and communication has opened up new digital divides between generations and socio-economic groups. This paper describes a novel study of perceptions and uses of eHealth and mHealth technologies in older Cantonese people in one area of Hong Kong. Data was collected through 20 hours of semi-structured interviews and group discussions with 16 people aged between 62 and 97. The findings of this research highlight the emergence of has been described as the <i>third digital divide <\/i>– that is, people may have access to digital devices and the ability to 'use' them but language, communication, education level and literacy skills limit the <i>transfer<\/i> of the benefits of access into everyday life. The continuing importance of eHealth is clear particularly in a global context of rapid technological advances, ageing populations, increasing rates of chronic disease and longer life expectancy. Exploring and understanding the digital divides(s) amongst older people and within particular communities and groups is vital to optimize the benefits of eHealth. This will in turn minimize the risks of developing technologies that function as mechanisms of division and, for some people, exclusion.\n","Abstracts: <i>Communication savoring<\/i> is defined as “the process of mindfully attending to pleasurable or meaningful social interactions” (Pitts, 2019, p. 254). Individuals can savor different types of communication, across different <i>relationships<\/i> and <i>contexts<\/i> (Authors in progress). Because savoring occurs most often within social contexts (Bryant & Veroff, 2007), communication savoring seeks to elucidate the ways people savor communication and <i>language <\/i>within these interactions. Language plays a variety of functions within social interactions (e.g., shape reality, construct identity, preserve memory). Understanding the language people use to describe their communication savoring moments can provide greater insight on <i>how<\/i> people savor communication.<br />Therefore, the goal for this IALSP presentation is twofold: (1) to explore the link between language and communication savoring for each of the seven types of communication savoring, and (2) to investigate potential similarities and differences in the language used by emerging and mature adults to savor communication. Drawing from our current research, we use 289 narratives across different ages to examine the language used to describe each type of communication savoring. Our preliminary findings highlighted <i>thematic<\/i> differences (i.e., continuity and change) among emerging and mature adults (Authors in progress). Thus, we further examine these differences focusing on the linguistic nuances of communication savoring between emerging and mature adults. Older adults are more likely to use positive affect words, less ego-centered references, and lexicon that reflects higher cognitive complexity (Pennebaker & Stone, 2003). These findings demonstrate the role of language in communication savoring in social interactions.\n","Abstracts: A robust working alliance between a patient and their physician has consistently been linked to better health outcomes for a range of chronic health conditions. However, the specific physician behaviours that contribute to the alliance have not been clearly identified, and few studies have been based on patient-derived conceptualisations of the alliance, the focus of our study. Fifty participants with a diagnosed chronic health condition and a self-reported robust working alliance with their physician were interviewed using the Critical Incidents technique and asked to describe observable behaviours that contributed to the working alliance. We report on 2 sets of analyses, one inductive, using patient ratings of the behaviours, and the other deductive, using communication accommodation theory (CAT). We demonstrate the unique insights each approach provides. Our inductive analysis revealed six categories named <i>Valuing the whole person, Investigation and future planning, Collaboration and empowering, Validation and emotional support, Polite and courteous, and Professionalism. <\/i>Our analysis using CAT found participants mentioned most frequently accommodative discourse management and positive face as effective communication strategies and underaccommodative positive face as ineffective. These findings suggest communication that is polite, respectful and shows interest in the patient as an individual, as well as allowing an exchange of information is particularly important with this population. Interestingly, there was less preference for communication that is nurturing.\n","Abstract Body: This study takes an in-depth look into the anti-sentiment to one of the most widespread social movements, the #MeToo movement.

This study aims to understand the complex dynamics involved in the development of an anti-sentiment towards this social movement, focusing on the antecedents to this backlash. More specifically, we investigate the role of citizens’ media use in potentially moderating this anti-sentiment, while analyzing its outcome on three different dimensions.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Employee burnout is a critical organizational concern that can be especially prevalent among<br />care workers whose day-to-day tasks inherently include emotional labor.

This study examined the effect of social distances by comparing personal and societal norms. Furthermore, by investigating the relationships between behavioral intentions and the different types of norms on two different temporal distances, the psychological and social influences on individuals’ intentions to engage in digital piracy and volunteering are compared. This research comprises two studies with different designs: a within-subject design and a between-subject design. The findings of the two studies indicated that temporal distance and personal norms were related to behavioral intentions. Because the variance explained by the latter is as twice as large as the former, it can be inferred from the findings that the effect of social influences on individuals’ behavioral intentions is larger than that of psychological influence.\n",null,"Abstracts: Innovation in technology has immensely impacted our culture, leaving society with a loss of potential for impactful content in entertainment mediums. A pattern of continuous diminishment in existing mediums show that whatever new technology is given to the public is presented and viewed as valuable, disregarding the power and the potential of media environments to influence positive change in culture. With this analysis, we argue that the introduction of television diminished the perceived value of radio because it engaged more than just listening and provided entertainment that consumed our society. We analyze the song “Radio Gaga” to ironically show the potential for cultural development in media through a lyrical evaluation of historical contexts and a critique on the advancement of new technology. The pattern of development in new technology has continued and will continue, creating a culture where existing media will fail to reach its full potential.<br /><br />Keywords: Radio, Television, Neil Postman, Queen, Technology\n","Abstracts: The development of technology and access to information is increasing: we have new technologies that allow us to access more accurate information about our reality and the world in general. Likewise, this information is increasing to the point that it is not possible to arrive at knowledge of everything that is offered to us. In the beginning, the purpose of this information was for the benefit of man: for his development and increasing knowledge in different areas, and wherein he could develop himself in better ways. However, what we have come to realize is the limitations we have. It seems, according to some theories, that we have reached an era of suppression of man because his abilities have reached their limit, and that it is now time for man to yield his place to the era of post-humanism, wherein technology has the power and helps man as something inferior to it.\n","Abstracts: This essay proposes an updated interpretation of meme ecology to include internet memes and digital remix. Independently, an internet meme cannot be understood on its own because it constitutes a network of variegated remixed material. The meme ecology posits that cultural transmission is separate from human intervention, though remix subverts this idea as it is dependent on algorithms to find an audience. In order to understand video memes in digital culture, a framework for understanding the ecology in which they live must be examined in terms of time and space and the symbiotic relationship in which they are created by vernacular voices and proliferated by algorithms. The concept of an open versus closed meme provides yet another dimension to meme ecology as a way to understand the politics and power of meme boundaries (i.e., who can and can’t make certain memes, who will understand them, etc.).<br /><br />This essay puts forth the concept of a swarm archive, which comes into being through the diachronic movement of the text and the valuable marginalia it picks up along the way. The popularity of <i>The Simpsons<\/i> coupled with Internet fan culture has produced copious remixed Internet memes from the show. Like Quintilian’s classical text <i>Institutio Oratoria<\/i>, which has evolved through time and culture into “Quintilianisms,” or essential, non-authorial iterations of the text, <i>The Simpsons<\/i> has evolved into a Simpsonalia, a swarm archive.

Based on in-depth interviews with the initiative’s participants, the paper highlights the fact-checkers’ narrative about their work, their self-image, daily routines, and fact-checking methods, heavily dependent on digital technology and networked communication in social media.

Both pro-Russian and pro-Ukrainian hacker groups participate in the conflict through DDoS and malware attacks and data leaks. They also use social media to participate in the public conflict discourse. I examine the social media presence of pro-Ukrainian hacker collectives to understand how they make meaning of their participation in the conflict. Examining public claims-making through the strategic construction of frames as “signifying work or meaning construction” (Snow and Benford 1988), I find that Ukrainian hackers frame their conflict activity as meaningful resistance beyond individualized disobedience. By framing hacking as resistance against the enemy for the benefit of their country, the hackers construct a symbolic narrative identity of “patriotic hacking”. This framing of collective hacking as resistance and narrativizing it as an expression of patriotism underscore the unique role of hackers in hybrid conflicts.<br /><br />Panelist qualifications: Tetyana Lokot has been researching activism, protest and censorship on the Cyrillic web for over a decade.

It examines three cases of conflict-related activism in the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict: developing air reconnaissance capabilities; performing open-source intelligence tasks; providing logistical support to forces on the ground. Relying on interviews with digital activists it explores the association between the perception of the state’s capacity to fulfil its security-related functions and self-mobilization of volunteers. That perception is addressed as the narratives of limited statehood (Risse, 2012). The paper highlights the association between these narratives and the mobilization that relies on the argument that traditional functions of the state can be performed by other actors relying on information technologies (Livingston & Walter-Drop, 2014). Following the changes in the narratives from limited statehood to restored statehood allows to examine the shifting role of digitally mediated conflict-related mobilization and the change in the nature of conflict-related activism.<br /><br />Panelist qualifications: Dr Gregory Asmolov is a Leverhulme Early Career Fellow at the Russia Institute, King's College London.

What motivates the nonviolent daily practices performed to further geopolitical outcomes? Having interviewed 25 activists crowdfunding military and humanitarian aid for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, we find they rely on multiple narratives to justify their cause. Activists predominantly construct an apocalyptic narrative that portrays the Russian occupation as an existential threat to the Ukrainian statehood and its people. In looking ahead, however, activists construct hybrid narratives that include features of both the romance and tragedy genres. Volunteers portray their efforts as improving conditions for soldiers, veterans, population from conflict areas, and Ukrainian civic institutions, while simultaneously believing that the Ukrainian government will remain inefficient.

Further, in order to validly measure social media use through self-report, it is critical to use wording that is consistent with how individuals talk about their own use. Therefore, we collected focus group data from eight diverse groups of adolescents living in the Midwestern United States (<i>N <\/i>= 59). Participants discussed their use of popular social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. We subjected the data to semantic network analysis. Results demonstrate clear differences in semantic networks of how adolescents describe and conceptualize each platform. Further, results indicate differing motivations for use, perceptions of use, and conceptualizations of audience. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings, including the generalizability of extant literature, as well as methodological considerations for future research.\n","Abstracts: Ever since the introduction of social media, such as Facebook and Instagram, public concerns have been expressed about the effects of such platforms on adolescents’ well-being. The aim of this talk is to provide insights into how different social media activities within platforms as well as across platforms associate with adolescents’ well-being. We will discuss findings from a multi-method study, consisting of interviews, a national survey, and a mobile experience sampling study among 14- and 15-year-olds. These findings contribute to our understanding of (1) how to accurately measure different social media activities, such as browsing and posting, (2) what social media activities adolescents engage in most often, (3) how different social media activities contribute to different indicators of well-being, such as affective well-being, and (4) what mechanisms may explain the effects of social media on well-being.\n","Abstracts: While many youth use social media (Anderson & Jiang, 2018), it is unclear how social media use differs across certain minority compared to majority adolescent populations. Results indicate that LGBT+ youth engage online at greater rates than non-LGBT+ youth (McInroy, McCloskey, Craig, & Eaton, 2019), and comparison across adult samples illustrate that LGBT+ users use social media at higher rates than non-LGBT+ users (Seidenberg et al., 2017). Despite this, little is known about LGBT+ youth’s actual use of social media, as most studies assessing LGBT+ populations online activities rely on self-report (for a review see Rose & Friedman, 2012). This study investigates LGBT+ youth’s social media use through leveraging users’ digital trace data over a social media site (<i>N <\/i>= 40,380 individual users). Results inform on time adolescent users spend on the social media app, and how this varies as a function of user’s identification within the LGBT+ community.\n","Abstracts: The literature has disputed the effects of social media on well-being, yet this research has largely neglected whether differential effects may occur depending on the type of social media interaction and personality traits, especially narcissism. To address these gaps, the present cross-sectional survey study among 1395 Belgian adolescents examined how exposure to- and the self-posting of positively biased content on social media differently related to adolescents’ life satisfaction. When controlling for gender, age, and general social media usage, the self-posting of positively biased social media content positively related to adolescents’ life satisfaction (β = .218,<i> t<\/i> = 7.332, <i>p<\/i> < .001), whereas exposure to such content did not (<i>p<\/i> > .05). Narcissism did not significantly moderate the examined relations (<i>p<\/i> > .05). These findings call for more research on self-effects, in particular, to explain the positive role of self-posting behavior in well-being.\n","Abstracts: Although scholars recently indicated that social networking sites (SNS) and alcohol may be related, the scholarly understanding of these associations remains limited. Building on the social impact theory, this cross-sectional study (<i>N<\/i> = 1636; <i>M<sub>age<\/sub><\/i> = 15.08; <i>SD<\/i> = 1.17) examined how different message types (private-persistent, private-ephemeral, public-persistent, public-ephemeral) are related to alcohol use, through different types of social norms (close friends vs. peers). We expected that both private message types (private-persistent, private-ephemeral), would be related to alcohol use through perceived close friends’ norms, while public message types would operate through distant peer norms. In line with our expectations, the association between exposure to alcohol in private ephemeral messages (e.g., Snapchat) and alcohol use was mediated by close friends’ norms. However, other mediating pathways were less clear. Although most of our hypotheses could not be confirmed, this study adds significantly to the literature as it is the first to introduce a new conceptualization of SNS exposure which takes the heterogeneity of social media into account.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Empowered by wisdom of the crowd, innovation nowadays is increasingly relying on diverse individuals’ knowledge collaboration. Research on crowdsourcing and open innovation has demonstrated that through deliberate understanding and reflexive thinking, members of online crowd collectively manage their knowledge so as to generate innovative ideas. However, the patterns of online crowd’s collective reflection over time remain unclear. Employing semantic network approach, this study aims at examining the evolving patterns generated by online crowd members’ collective reflection when taking part in crowdsourcing innovation challenges. Based on analyzing a total of 1,116 posts contributed by online crowd responding to organization-sponsored crowdsourcing innovation challenges, findings show that as the crowd members collaboratively reflect on the shared diverse knowledge, the semantic patterns of online individuals’ knowledge collaboration evolve from one phase to another in the discussion. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n","Abstract Body: This study examines Facebook users' intention to adopt proactive opinion expression avoidance strategies (i.e., hide a post, unfollow, temporarily snooze, and unfriend a contact) when reacting to opposing views, using the legalization of same-sex marriage in Taiwan as the focal issue. Two personal qualities—psychological reactance and willingness to self-censor—are incorporated into Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to verify the technological and dispositional influences on user intention. The results from 910 Taiwanese Facebook users validate that those prone to self-censorship and with a higher level of reactance are more likely to adopt this set of strategies. Moreover, the findings identify the pivotal roles of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of the strategies that mediate the adoption process. Implications are discussed to help enrich knowledge about the determinants of proactive opinion expression avoidance behaviors and broaden the applications of this research topic from politics to social issues.\n","Abstract Body: Sharing information about disasters and victims can help raise situational awareness, enhance issue-related knowledge, promote prosocial behaviors and rebuild a sense of community during the recovery stages. In the current study, we investigate two specific ways of framing climate change victim information, how they influence the likelihood of sharing such information on social media, and the underlying cognitive and emotional mechanisms. Participants (<i>N <\/i>= 631) were randomly assigned to 1 of 12 experimental conditions as part of 2 (victim exemplification: present vs. absent) x 2 (provocative language: present vs. absent) x 3 (message stimuli) between-subjects factorial design. Main findings indicate that, although both sadness and message enjoyment were positively associated with information sharing intentions, messages that induced more enjoyment and less sadness were more likely to be shared. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.\n","Abstracts: News media coverage of Public Environmental Litigation (PEL) enacted as part of an environmental campaign is an opportunity for legal discourse to influence ‘mediatized environmental conflict’ (Hutchins and Lester 2015). Inside the court, legal rules and discourse constrain and offer opportunities for litigants to make claims. Outside the court, anyone can interpret legal decisions. This article explores the visual representation of PEL in news media to uncover the implications on environmental debate. Using PEL against the Adani Carmichael coal mine project as a case study, the approach applies visual discourse analysis to a news corpus of 223 images. The research finds images function to: (1) reinforce the coal industry brand; (2) provide ‘mediated visibility’ for litigants (Thompson 2005); (3) show evidence of impacts; and (4) demonstrate social relationships between actors. The dominant use of generic coal industry images encourages the viewer to not really look, stifles emotional responses and reinforces Australia’s acceptance of coal.\n","Abstracts: While aquaculture is fast becoming the most stable source of seafood, the perceived environmental impact of fin-fish aquaculture has been the focus of substantial environmental campaigning, media and public scrutiny around the world. By a nalysing  news media and conducting interviews with key stakeholders, t his  research  examine d  how the environmental risk  of the Tasmanian salmon industry was  defined, articulated and publicly negotiated between stakeholder groups . News media discourse was predominantly framed by environmental risk, expansion of the industry and the adequacy of government regulation. Within these themes, environmental science and community interests became intrinsically conflated, with a perceived lack of transparency and trust in both environmental science information and local and global standards for regulating environmental impacts. This opens up questions regarding the role of environmental science, community interests, media and decision-making processes.\n","Abstracts: With emerging solutions and constructive journalism practices, news outlets increasingly centralise hopeful news in their reporting of the environment. Implicit in their normative justifications is the idea of hope as a public and democratic good and, in particular, hope as a means of opening up public discourse about the environment, freeing it from paralysing anxiety and fear. While a journalistic innovation, this idea about hope is now pervasive in documentary films, political pronouncements, corporate public relations and activist communications alike. Without losing hope, this paper scrutinises the implicit assumptions underlying claims about the efficacy of ecological hope. Based on analysis of Australian future-focused articles, I argue that solution-focused stories are often a means of enclosing, safeguarding and privatising imagined ecological futures. Without considering who gives and is given hope and who is excluded, ecological hope risks creating communities of exclusion and a discursive vacuum for spurious and insurgent hopes.\n","Abstracts: Australia published the first book by an Indigenous Australian in 1964, a poetry collection called We Are Going by activist Kath Walker who later changed her name to Oodgeroo Noonuccal. In the subsequent decades, Australian book publishing has witnessed critical success of some writers who are Indigenous, but any strategic effort to build pathways to publication has largely fallen to small independent publishers through publicly-funded dedicated awards and fellowships. As an industry, Australian book publishing enjoys its Indigenous success stories but has established no standards or targets, maintains limited data, and employs few Indigenous professionals. An analysis of the pathways to publication that Indigenous writers have taken reveals an industry with no coherent approach to diversifying its lists on the basis of Indigeneity and explores dynamics of race and culture that has produced this status.\n","Abstracts: Across the UK cultural industries the issue of ‘diversity’ is high on the agenda. This is particularly the case in publishing where the issue of diversity dominates industry discussion. Publishers are aware of their own institutional whiteness and understand that they have to do better in terms of the diversity of the authors that they publish. Based on a large-scale study of the UK publishing industry involving over 100 in-depth interviews, this presentation looks at how ‘diversity’ is made sense of and operationalised. Rather than an object to measure, diversity is understood as a discourse that shapes the making of writers of colour. The aim of this presentation is to show the different discourses of diversity – from moral/ethical to economic – that steer the acquisition and publication of writers from minority backgrounds, and considers what effects this has upon the narratives of race and difference that are allowed to emerge.\n","Abstracts: The Australia Council has recently embraced a discourse of ‘aspirational diversity’ which foregrounds cultural hybridity and intersectionality. But despite this ambitious vision of a diverse and harmonious Australia, only 8% of professional artists in Australia are from non-English speaking backgrounds (Throsby and Petetskaya 2017). This paper argues that Australian arts policy needs to engage with the politics of race in order to address this ‘diversity problem’ (Ang and Mar 2016). Claims that we exist in a fluid, post-multicultural era are at odds with a heightened sense among many artists that they live in increasingly racialised times. By eschewing the language of race, the discourse of aspirational diversity does not offer the political or administrative tools necessary for achieving its own vision. Engaging with categories of race would allow arts policymakers to account for racialised exclusion, and offer critical resources that can make visible the political projects of non-White artists.\n","Abstracts: For years the Chinese government has poured tremendous resources into rural informatization, or developing information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, services, and applications in the countryside, with the belief that ICTs will boost the rural economy and empower rural residents. Most recently, such government projects have been undertaken in partnership with e-commerce giant Alibaba and its development of Taobao Villages, or villages where a large number of villagers produce and sell goods on Taobao (similar to Amazon), and Rural Taobao, a system of service centers in rural towns networked via a digital app. Government and popular discourse on rural e-commerce touts the transformative power of such efforts (Aliresearch, 2017). Research on Taobao Villages has found that in some locales the rural economy has developed (Lin, Xie, and Lu, 2016), yet the few studies that have analyzed the gendered dimensions of such projects have found mixed results regarding women’s empowerment (Yu and Cai, 2019). This paper draws from research on micro-entrepreneurship and e-commerce undertaken by women in a village in Shandong province over the course of eight years of fieldwork offline and online between 2011 and 2019. I focus in particular on whether women’s use of Rural Taobao and other social media for e-commerce has led to their economic and personal empowerment. The results reveal that despite these women’s business acumen and technological savvy, persistent structural impediments and deeply entrenched patriarchal familial relationships limit their long-term success. Implications for policymakers in China and other parts of the Global South are also discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Protest movements around contemporary concerns of great importance to young people in India emerge through hashtag publics everyday now. Simultaneously, Indian politicians are also actively using digital tools – particularly Twitter and WhatsApp – to spread campaign (mis)information through planned and concerted use of hashtag publics and have contributed to the toxicity in these spaces by producing what Sahana Udupa refers to as “Gaali cultures” (Udupa 2017). Yet the Indian diasporic digital publics have a history of contributing to a dominant caste, patriarchal and mostly Hindu discourse on what it means to be “Indian.”<br /><br />In a post 2012 era of Indian hashtag publics, we see that activists – trans, queer, feminist and Dalit - have taken it upon themselves to talk truth to power to correct disinformation and misrepresentation or lack of representation in mainstream media and on social media. These movements occur in an environment of instant interaction where the activists face various kinds of push back.\n","Abstract Body: While there is a growing literature on ‘digital interlopers’ who are redrawing of boundaries of journalism (Elridge 2018), digitalization can also be seen as making the field more open. This paper uses the framework of ‘openness’ to explore whether more transparent and collaborative practices are enabling groups that have historically remained marginalized to gain a foothold in Indian journalism. In particular, the paper explores these trends in the work of two digital journalism organizations that are working with marginalized groups, particularly from the younger demographic. It shows that openness is strategic and is often entangled with the political field along three inter-related aspects of digital journalism; firstly in crowd-sourcing daily news agenda, secondly in the strategic use of analytical insights from journalists’ social media handles, and finally in terms of responding to extreme speech and retaliation they encounter in their engagement online.\n",null,null,"Abstracts: Financial philanthropy towards the media has never figured large in Australia – until recently. According to a 2016 study of media ownership (Noam et al), Australia’s media are among the most concentrated in the world and becoming worse. The 2019 Digital News Report (Reuters) concluded that the previous twelve months had seen upheaval that included ‘takeovers, closures, [and] job losses [followed by the emergence of] ‘a philanthropist bearing $100m.’ The Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas has announced some bold measures to strengthen international newsgathering in the global South, by enabling the <i>Australian Financial Review<\/i> to reopen its Jakarta bureau and the <i>Guardian<\/i> to hire a Pacific editor to develop a reporting network of local journalists from the region. This paper will use qualitative interviewing and content analysis to examine various philanthropic case studies and query if this new model of funding will prove stable.\n","Abstracts: The power to produce global visual narratives about conflicts has long been concentrated amongst a few Western-centric media organisations and photographers. But this hierarchy in global ‘image operations’ is shifting at the ground level as more locally-based image producers become part of the supply chain. Scholarly investigations in this area have so far focused on the local-global collisions resulting from this change. But collaborations between globally-established image producers and under-represented groups of visual storytellers are also being undertaken by international NGOs. To shed light on this, findings will be presented from in-depth interviews with 22 photographers from 20 countries in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. These photographers took part in a mentorship programme with 23 globally-established photographers run by the Native Agency in 2018. The study will offer empirical insight into the potentials and pitfalls of NGO-driven collaborative efforts to diversify global visual storytelling.\n","Abstracts: Investigative journalism is facing challenges at a global level, such as funding and political restrictions across both the developed and developing world. It is an expensive form of journalism that requires lengthy time frames with little financial return, however its impact could be significant. Nonetheless, funding is not currently a major concern in the Arab world at these beginning stages, since investigative journalism in the Arab region is being sustained through seed funding from European-based NGOs. Yet seeding funding is not guaranteed on the long run, and the sustainability of Arab investigative training and practice will become an issue if not addressed early on. This paper, through an analysis of current funding models, in addition to interviews with trainers, reporters and managers, discusses the financial challenges facing Arab investigative journalism, specifically in relation to future implications for sustaining such a form of journalism.\n",null,"Abstract Body: Choosing to participate in medical research and clinical trials is stressful and challenging for cancer patients. Communicating about clinical trial participation is also complicated for healthcare providers. Information aids can support both doctor-patient discussions and patients’ decisions, in particular when such aids offer interactive features that may help to target individuals’ experiences with the information aid to their needs. However, despite the potential of interactive information aids, it is still not clear what factors can contribute to their success or failure to address patients’ information needs. This study described an experiment conducted with cancer patients and survivors aimed at comparing the effects of two information aids (one characterized by both modality and message interactivity and one by modality interactivity only) to communicate about clinical trial participation. The role of two moderators (perceived visual informativeness and cancer information overload) and one mediating variable (cognitive absorption) is revealed. Results indicate that the information aid with both modality and message interactivity better supported individuals’ decision-making and contributed to create more positive attitudes and a greater knowledge. Contrary to the expectations, cancer information overload was experienced more by participants using the modality interactivity-only information aids. Theoretical and practical explanations are provided.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Repeated vaccine scandals have shaken Chinese parents’ confidence in vaccine safety.  Researching this event as a risk topic, this study employs the risk information and processing model (RISP; Griffin, Dunwoody, & Neuwirth, 1999) to examine social cognitive variables that motivate active information seeking and systematic processing related to this issue. Results indicate that informational subjective norms, which is the perceived social expectation on one’s information level about a risk topic, is the strongest predictor of information seeking and systematic processing. As a novel contribution to existing literature, this study also discovers a significant interaction between relevant channel beliefs and perceived information gathering capacity. This finding suggests that Chinese parents are deliberate in their information seeking about the vaccine scandals, considering both information quality and accessibility in their channel selection. Results from this study highlight the importance of health and risk communication to attend to literacy and social norms when communicating about vaccine safety and vaccination in China.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: Social media influence on body image and health behavior variables is an important area of study. Social media provides users with several comparison points both from a consumer perspective and also a social interaction perspective. Popular brands have included a limited diversity in model body types,  and there is potential for this to influence media consumers’ self-perceptions and health outcomes (Sabiston & Chandler, 2009). This timely project explores the influence of exposure to social media images of women and men and the impact of Instagram images on health-related behaviors and responses (eating and exercise behaviors, and psychophysiological responses). This study also further explores the influence of male model body types on behaviors and responses, an understudied area of research (Cordes, Vocks, Düsing, Bauer, & Waldorf, 2016; Hobza, Walker, Yakushko, & Peugh, 2007). Social Comparison Theory argues that people participate in upward comparisons to others and may do so unconsciously (Festinger, 1954; Goethals, 1986). We broadly predict that participants  (particularly women) will upwardly compare themselves to thin models and will demonstrate extreme intentions to diet and exercise. We question whether men will upwardly compare themselves to an average-sized model because men may not have the same “thin ideal” (Tylka, 2011). This research also questions whether physiological and eye-tracking data will indicate more attention and positive emotional responses to thin models. To study these predictions and questions, a two-part experimental design study is proposed.<br /><br />Methods and Procedures<br /><br />Part 1<br /><br />The study design is a 3 (Model Type: thin, average, large models) x 2 (Gender: male model type; female model type) between-subjects design (6 stimuli total). Two hundred and forty (<i>N<\/i> = 240) college students who identify as Instagram users (ages 18-24) will be recruited. This allows for 40 participants per condition. Each participant will be exposed to one stimulus image. The stimuli are mock-ups of fake Instagram posts for a swimwear company (stimuli materials were created by the researchers and a graphic designer). The model in the image was male or female and thin, average, or large-sized. Dependent variables included: State Appearance Comparison, intention to exercise, menu choice and motivation for their menu choice, and compensation selection.<br /><br />Part 2<br /><br />The study design is a 3 (Model Type: thin, average, large models) x 2 (Race: Black model, White models) within-subjects design (6 stimuli, all-female models). Like part 1, each stimulus is a mock-up of a fake Instagram post for a swimwear company. Participants are female college students who are Instagram users (ages 18-24). Eye tracking, heart rate, skin conductance, and Affectiva (facial expression based emotional reaction analysis) data will be collected in response to each of the six images. We will recruit at least <i>N<\/i> = 40 people since the study is within-subjects—pending a power analysis.<br /><br />Independent variables<br /><br />Model type. This was defined as thin, average, and large (plus-sized) model types in the Instagram images.<br /><br />Gender. This was defined as the gender of the model, including male and female model images for parsimony and comparison.<br /><br />Race. This was defined as the race of the model: Black or White was included for parsimony and comparison.<br /><br />Dependent variables<br /><br />State appearance comparison. To determine how the participant feels immediately after viewing the Instagram post, the authors used a scale from Tiggemann and McGill (2004). Participants will respond on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 = <i>no thought or comparison<\/i> to 7 = <i>a great deal of comparison<\/i> to answer the following questions: “How much did you think about your appearance when viewing the model?” and “To what extent did you compare specific body parts with the model?”.<br /><br />Intention to improve exercise habits. This will be measured by the exercise habits items written in the future tense (Telama et al., 2002; Sukys et al., 2014; e.g., “After viewing the Instagram ad, do you intend to … [do cardio exercises, do strength training, etc.]”?<br /><br />Menu choice. Participants will choose between healthy and unhealthy food options after viewing the image. Caloric details will be provided as a cue. Specifically, participants will be asked to choose two separate food items (1 = <i>an appetizer<\/i> and 2 = <i>main dish<\/i>) from a counter-balanced menu. Participants will have the choice of choosing mozzarella sticks (unhealthy) or salad (healthy). For the main dish, participants will get to choose from healthy choices of grilled chicken, pasta with vegetables, or unhealthy choices of fried chicken or creamy pasta.<br /><br />Motivation for eating food scale. To determine participants’ motivations for their menu choices, the authors will adapt four 3-item subscales (liking, social image, health, and pleasure) from Renner, Sproesser, Strohbach, and Schupp (2012). Participants will indicate motivations on a 7-item scale ranging from 1 = <i>completely disagree <\/i>to 7 = <i>completely agree<\/i> to answer questions such as “I [chose those food items] because I like it,” “I [chose those food items] because it makes me look good in front of others,” “I [chose those food items] because it is healthy,” and “I [chose those food items] because I enjoy it.”<br /><br />Compensation selection. Participants will choose between a McDonalds (unhealthy choice) or Subway (healthy choice) gift card.<br /><br />Emotional facial response. Affectiva data will be analyzed (software and hardware provided by iMotions) Affectiva provides a myriad of emotional response data to the stimuli. (Kulke, Feyerabend, & Schacht, 2018).<br /><br />Attention. Attention was measured with heart rate. Attention here is defined as resources allocated to encoding (e.g., in the encoding, storage, and retrieval sub-processes). This is indicated by a decrease in heart rate, shown by the electrocardiogram distances between R-spikes (i.e., blood activity/flow) (Lang, 1990). <br /><br />Arousal. Arousal is measured by skin conductance. Emotional arousal will be measured by skin conductance response and level by two electrodes placed on the participant’s fingers to measure a large amount of eccrine sweat gland activity there.  These will record electrodermal activity innervated by the sympathetic nervous system within the autonomic nervous system (shows dimensional calmness vs. excitement; Dawson, Schell, Filion, 2000; Ravaja, 2004).<br /><br />Attention to stimuli via eye tracking. This will be conceptualized by attention to the body parts or areas of the model’s body by looking at heat maps and eye movement/fixation periods for each image. (Li, Huang, & Christianson, 2016).<br /><br />Timeline<br /><br />The research team will be ready to present at ICA 2020. Our campus IRB has approved the study, and we plan to run Part 1 in November 2019 and Part 2 in January-March 2020.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Menu calorie labeling is a relatively recent legislative invention and has not been empirically supported as contributing to fewer calories consumed. This paper examines three factors that, based on previous empirical data, could potentially limit the effectiveness of calorie labels in influencing consumer food choices – the use of visual food cues, the type of foods offered (lesser and greater energy density), and the amount of foods displayed. In general, calorie labels exhibited limited effectiveness at lessening calories selected for consumption, especially when visual cues were present. When a greater number of food options were present, individuals selected the most calories, even though they had the option to select less energy dense options. Individuals' nutrition knowledge did not influence these results, but motivation to restrict calories did, as would be expected.\n","Abstract Body: Some have lamented the fact that elite and professional women athletes are rarely featured in advertising campaigns for sports related products in lieu of fashion models (Di Giulian, 2017; Krupnick, 2017). Male athletes, on the other hand, are more often used in advertising efforts (Krupnick, 2017). This timely project has the potential to explore the positive influences of images of elite female athletes on health-related attitudes and behaviors and add empirical backing to the criticisms found in the popular press. Preliminary results suggest perceived authenticity of the elite athlete plays a mediating role between model type and health related intentions.\n","Abstract Body: Background: Previous research has shown that unsuccessful restrained eaters (i.e., chronic dieters with low perceived self-regulatory success; PSRS) are more susceptible to seeing palatable, but unhealthy food cues (e.g., words representing food) compared to successful restrained eaters (i.e., chronic dieters with high PSRS) and unrestrained eaters (i.e., non-dieters). The current study investigated whether this also applies to food cues embedded in media content, by testing the effects of exposure to food-related (vs. non-food related) TV content on unhealthy food choices.<br />Methods: In a single factor between-subjects experiment, participants were exposed to a cooking segment with high-calorie cakes (<i>n<\/i> = 50) or a non-food segment (<i>n <\/i>= 62) of “The Rachael Ray Show”. Next, participants completed 52 trials in a choice task, of which 20 were target choices between unhealthy and healthy foods. The percentage of unhealthy foods chosen was used as dependent variable. Eating restraint and PSRS were measured afterwards.<br />Results: No support was found for the expected three-way interaction between TV content, eating restraint, and PSRS. However, a main effect of PSRS (<i>p<\/i> =.036) was found: people with lower levels of PSRS (i.e., unsuccessful self-regulators) made a higher percentage of choices for unhealthy food compared to people with higher levels of PSRS (i.e., successful self-regulators).<br />Discussion: The current study showed no evidence of unsuccessful restrained eaters’ heightened susceptibility to food cues in a cooking show, suggesting that results from previous research using isolated food cues cannot simply be applied to food cues embedded in media content. Future research could test whether this would be the case with a stronger manipulation of food cues (i.e., longer exposure time) and/or a more direct measure of behavior (i.e., actual food intake during food exposure).\n",null,"Abstract Body: Studies of social norms have been conducted primarily in Western countries making the generalizability of current methods and findings unknown. As this changes, the need for models to study norms in a cultural context is needed. To fill this gap, we report on a two-Study study (i.e., in-depth interviews and household surveys) with ethnically Tibetan pastoralists in Western China resulting in a culturally derived measurement of social norms and potential moderators of the norm-behavior relationship. The results provide preliminary evidence for the nature of normative influence in this population and the construct validity and reliability of the culturally derived normative scales.  <br />\n","Abstract Body: Nutritional communication research helps with public health promotion, government dietary intervention and future outlooks for the dietetics profession. This research explores the way health professionals target niche population groups to educate on nutrition. The phenomenological methodology and the Communication Accommodation theory framework guided interviews with 10 Arab-speaking females diagnosed with type II diabetes or prediabetes. The findings reveal eight major underlying themes: language, socio-economic impact, level of integration/adaptation to new environment, role of religion in life, health is a personal responsibility, role of family/specific family members, role of health professional and views on the Canadian food/culture. Ultimately, dietary acculturation of the sample group is influenced by level of English language proficiency, health literacy, exposure to health information and cultural values.<br />\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: This study examined the impact of 360° journalism on information processing variables, as well as underlying mechanisms that drive the effects of news modality on information seeking intention and individual differences that moderate the observed outcomes. The results of the two condition between-subject experiment (<i>N<\/i>=100) conducted on a community sample showed that news modality affected information seeking intention, enjoyment of news story, and the feelings of spatial presence, but did not affect actual information seeking behavior and information recall. Exposure to the 360° modality led to an increase in spatial presence, which led to a linear increase in enjoyment, ultimately resulting in greater intentions to seek further information. Participants with a higher need for cognitive closure enjoyed consuming news more when the story was presented in a 360° modality than those with a lower need for cognitive closure. Results contribute to expanding the theories of information seeking and information processing in journalism and communication scholarship.<br />\n",null,"Abstract Body: This paper examines the impact of augmented reality (AR) on users’ sense of presence, knowledge gain, and perceived authenticity, accuracy and credibility of journalistic visuals. In a mixed experimental design, 79 participants were randomly assigned to view three New York Times articles in one of the three viewing modalities: either with AR visualizations, interactive visualizations or non-interactive, static visualizations. AR created a significantly higher sense of presence compared to the interactive and static modalities. The participants perceived that they learned more details from the AR visuals compared to the other viewing modalities. However, there were no significant differences in the objective knowledge gain measures between the conditions. The viewing modality did not have a significant effect on the perceived authenticity, accuracy or credibility of the visuals. The findings call for more efficient ways to relay information through AR while keeping the user engaged in the immersive experience.\n","Abstract Body: A 2 (Mood: Positive vs. Negative) x 2 (Modality Interactivity: Scrolling vs. Swiping) x 2 (Length: Long form vs. Short Form) x 2 (Topic: Zika vs. West Nile) between-subject experiment (N = 332) was conducted to examine the impact of mood, modality interactivity, news story length, and topic on user engagement under the context of smartphone news reading. Two three- way interactions among mood, length, and topic on dimensions of user engagement were obtained.\n","Abstract Body: In this article, we present an analysis of inequalities in online and offline news media ecosystems across a strategic sample of six countries (US, UK, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Spain). Using survey data from the 2018 Reuters Institute Digital News Report (Newman et al., 2018), we are able to compare inequalities in traditional offline (TV, radio, print) and online news media environments. Our results show that: (1) across all six countries, the online news environment is more unequal than the offline one in terms of the number of news sources that people use, (2) on average people use more news sources offline everywhere but the US, (3) interest in news is a stronger predictor of online news use than offline news use across all countries, and (4) education is a stronger predictor of online news use everywhere except Italy and Spain. These findings suggest that the shift towards online news use could widen the gaps between the information rich and the information poor. They also suggest that the rise of online news consumption is reinforcing longstanding social inequalities in traditional news consumption.<br />\n","Abstract Body: A representative U.S. survey (<i>n<\/i> = 1,179) affirmed the produsage hypothesis: production and consumption of news and information on social media are correlated. The association persisted when controlling for age, gender, education, general social media use, and propensity for online interaction. Importantly, the correlation existed for both active and passive forms of news consumption. The findings extend communication theory of identity and show that social media can contribute to a more aware and engaged citizenry.\n","Abstract Body: Push notifications provide news outlets with direct access to audiences in a time of information overload, disinformation, and heightened competition for reader attention. This form of news distribution is relevant because it a) bypasses social media and news aggregators by reaching readers directly; b) alters the agency and control of temporal news personalisation; and c) reinforces the mobile as the locus of contact between news organisations and the audience. We explore news organisations’ use of push notifications and whether they are attempting to integrate with existing mobile user behaviour patterns or to be a disruptive element and garner attention when audience members are not typically using their devices. Through a quantitative content analysis, this study examines the temporal dimension and content attributes of push notifications (n=7092) from nine Northwestern European countries, comprising 34 news outlets, gathered over the first trimester of 2019. The study shows how push notifications dissemination align with existing behaviours of news consumption as channel for attracting and maintaining users’ attention, with varying interpretations of temporal customizability.\n","Abstract Body: How to define and measure media diversity has become a major concern in today’s media landscape. Many expect that algorithmic filtering and a shift of audiences from legacy media to new intermediaries and platforms decrease the diversity of news diets, leading to fragmented societies, polarization and spread of misinformation. Different fields, from communication and journalism research to law and computer science, are involved in the study of media diversity. They operate, however, with vastly different vocabularies, theoretical frameworks, and measurement approaches. To overcome this fragmentation of media diversity research, this study provides an extensive overview of conceptualizations and operationalizations of media diversity in different fields using a systematic literature review of the past two decades (1999-2018). Based on this, we show how combining various theoretical and methodological approaches into one framework can help to provide important avenues for interdisciplinary assessment of media diversity especially in online environments. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This is an Extended Abstract submission.\n","Abstract Body: Various recent studies (e.g. Welbers & Opgenhaffen, 2018) show that the role played by the news media's Facebook pages should not be underestimated, given that they are responsible for a considerable share of the visits and the engagement of the news consumer towards the online news sites of news organisations. We can also see the Facebook page of a news medium as an important new gatekeeper, determining which news from the news site appears on the timeline of the social media user, who reads this news either consciously or incidentally (see e.g. Fletcher & Nielsen, 2018). The real gatekeeper is in fact the person sitting behind the controls of the Facebook page, who makes a selection among the articles that have appeared on the online news site and adapts or 'remediates' these articles to the Facebook page of the same news channel. The considerations and final decisions that this person (whom we shall call the <i>social media news editor<\/i>or SME from now on) makes in order to 'sell' the news to the scrolling and scanning public, will determine which news item from the news medium will be presented to the public through the social media platforms such as Facebook, and in which form. Certainly, in these days where many news consumers consider social media as an important source of news, it is important to know how the selection and shaping of the news happens. However, very little is known as yet about the profile and the journalistic routines of these social media editors. For example, we can think about the news criteria that the social media editors apply to select the news from the online site for publication on the Facebook page of the same medium, the strategies and techniques that they use in shaping these messages to lure the public in and make them click, share, react and tag. On the basis of interviews with 22 social media editors from 22 large news organisations in Flanders (Belgium) and The Netherlands – with notably the biggest daily papers, sports news sites, alternative news media and online-only websites – we want to gain some insight into the specific profile of these social media editors (SMEs) and the underlying motivation regarding the selection of news and its presentation. We therefore formulate the following research questions: <br /> <br />RQ1: What is the profile of the Flemish and Dutch social media editor? <br />RQ2: How does the social media editor select news articles from the news site for publication on the Facebook page?<br />RQ3: How does the social media editor shape these articles? <br />\n","Abstract Body: In September 2019, as heated arguments over Brexit dominated the House of Commons, journalists strove to contextualize the bizarre proceedings for their readership. For some, Brexit marked England’s end as a world power (Zakaria, 2019). For others, it was a chance to extoll Boris Johnson’s apparent virtues (Young, 2019). Beyond mainstream outlets, however, the debates aired to a global audience on the popular live-streaming platform Twitch.tv. Accompanying the CSPAN-like broadcast was a chat room populated by seemingly ordinary citizens who offered their own commentary and analysis—sometimes productive (e.g. fact-checking MPs’ statements in real-time), often irreverent (e.g. “BORIS REKT LIVE ON TWITCH”)—about what was transpiring on screen. This co-constructed story simultaneously defied traditional coverage and journalistic norms, while providing a relatively unfiltered means to watch an epochal moment in British politics.<br /><br />Purpose and Conceptual Framework<br /><br />Events like those in Parliament, and its broadcasting on a user-generated content platform, highlight the strange place Twitch occupies in contemporary journalism. In 2018 alone, Twitch viewers consumed 9.3 billion hours of live content (Yosilewitz, 2018) which included everything from news coverage to dating shows and gameplay. In this way, Twitch is emblematic of live-streaming’s growing importance in the media ecosystem (Taylor 2018). Besides this, the oblique relationship with the Washington Post typifies Twitch’s potential relevance to newsmakers. Both outlets, owned by Jeff Bezos, thrive in an era of “platformization” (Nieborg & Poell 2018) in cultural production; for instance, each has monetized their technical “backends” to generate content for gaming audiences (in the case of Twitch; see Taylor, 2018) and provide tool sets for smaller news organizations (in the case of the Post; see Watson et al., 2018). With journalists constantly turning toward emerging technologies (Siles & Boczkowski, 2012), it is unsurprising that the Post has even started its own Twitch channel, which exists alongside hyper-partisan press, live esports broadcasts and decidedly non-institutional forms of newsmaking, such as the caustic Brexit voices.<br /><br />This suggests that Twitch, theoretically, is rife with possibilities to address persistent challenges to the production, monetization, and circulation of journalistic content: its funding model of subscriptions and donations, as well as its low barrier to entry, could be revenue sources to local outlets; the format supports journalists’ need for live coverage; the chat functions allow for direct feedback with an audience that is near-impossible in television and print (Gans, 2005). However, Twitch is rarely embraced by the mainstream press, which has meant that nonfiction reportage only exists at the margins of the platform in favor of entertainment.<br /><br />Our proposed research is both prescriptive and descriptive in setting forth the potential and actual uses of Twitch as a journalistic tool. We first situate Twitch’s development within the context of live broadcasting and streaming in journalism. Even during Occupy Wall Street, the seemingly “unedited and immediate” (Lenzer, 2014, p. 260) nature of live-streaming was closely aligned to journalistic ethics while filming obfuscated the practical and professional roles of audiences and reporters. Scholarly work has primarily focused on political activism (Fichet et al, 2016; Kavada & Treré 2019) and novel hardware (Mills & Pase, 2017), but mostly highlights the struggles and opportunities for the public to consume and respond to live digital feeds from novel channels that exist outside of traditional news organizations.<br /><br />However, Twitch distinguished itself from such predecessors (i.e. Justin.TV) by pivoting away from live reportage. The company remained viable by exploring innovative monetization strategies (Johnson & Woodcock, in press), and encouraging content centered on technology and gaming. Its return to nonfiction content dovetails with ongoing concerns about a platformized media environment where the production, distribution and monetization of news through programs like Twitch affect the type of content being made (fracturing audiences and outlets alike) and result in deep reexamination of journalistic independence and the value of news coverage (van Dijck et al., 2018). This reality has not only instigated experimentation with new technologies from social (Lasorsa et al., 2012) to immersive (Sirkkunen et al., 2016) media, but also reconsideration of common tones and practices, as with the shifting boundaries and styles of journalists on Instagram (Maares & Hanusch, 2018).<br /><br />Such studies place Twitch provocatively at the edges of journalism’s current issues. A potential tool for reporters and outlets while also representing some of the profession’s biggest challenges (Cooper, 2019), its ethics, affiliations, economics, tone and practice necessitate scrutiny. Therefore, we ask:<br /><br />RQ1: What are the key technical, economic and cultural features that make Twitch a potentially useful tool for journalists?<br /><br />RQ2: How do these features affect its adoption and current practices by mainstream and alternative journalists?<br /><br />Methods and Potential Findings<br /><br />We will first analyze each aforementioned factors based on Twitch’s economic, infrastructural and governance strategies (Nieborg & Poell, 2018) to articulate potential use cases of the platform. Since it has not been extensively employed in journalistic production, to understand current implementation we will follow a comparative case study model (George and Bennett, 2005) that focuses on a number of Twitch’s existing news carriers: “Touring News” (https://www.twitch.tv/touringnews) is an amateur broadcast of serious news; the Washington Post’s channel is an example of a legacy publication experimenting with Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/washingtonpost); and the hyper-partisan “Patriot Soap Box” (https://www.twitch.tv/patriotssoapbox) breaks with journalistic norms in favor of highly editorialized and ideological content.<br /><br />The final presentation will evaluate each case and critique Twitch as a journalistic tool through an inductive analysis of these producers’ streams and broader coverage of them by other outlets and streamers. Through this we aim to illustrate how news on Twitch is already influencing its potential path for reporters. By highlighting practical and theoretical appropriations and misappropriations of the platform, the paper will ultimately situate the live-streaming tool within the broader ideologies and political-economy of journalism, games and new media technologies. It will demonstrate how this supposed open form of live communication is actually stymied by contemporary industry and practice.<br /><br />References<br />Cooper, G. (2019).

However, previous research knows only little about the innovation activities of professional journalists. Hence, this paper utilizes in-depth interviews with 24 journalists to look at how journalists and editors make sense of media innovation in the context of their daily work. The theoretical lens of innovative learning culture in the newsroom (Porcu, 2017) is applied.\n","Abstract Body: Study Purpose<br />This study seeks to capture processes and moderators of change in consumption patterns around news and media use. By untangling the processes which drive the (re)formation of media and news repertoires and their interrelations over time, the study moves beyond the ‘here and now’ (Peters & Schrøder 2018) of people’s current news repertoires towards the understanding of how and why news become meaningful over time. Theoretically, the analysis adopts a Grounded Theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 2017, Charmaz 2006) and combines a focus on change with key concepts from cross-media research and structuration theory (Giddens 1984), advancing knowledge about the form, shape and temporalities of change from an emic perspective.   <br />\n","Abstract Body: Teaching young people to distinguish the difference between fact and fiction is increasingly difficult in an era when some populists leaders appear to place political gain above public safety. This research paper reports on the three-year longitudinal study of a journalistic instructional approach to overall learning designed to support middle school students in becoming more <i>informed thinkers<\/i>.  Our research team developed this program and piloted it in 2016 at a school in a conservative community in a rural Pacific Northwest community shortly after President Donald Trump was elected. The curriculum was embedded in three sections of English language arts/social studies classes, where each Thursday students conducted research, identified experts, and interviewed them via Skype about societal concerns. <i>Self-determination theory<\/i> provides the framework for this work, which posits that students motivation and learning is enhanced by pedagogical practices that foster <i>autonomy, competency, <\/i>and <i>relatedness<\/i>.\n",null,"Abstracts: This study assesses how civic data organizations extract journalistic norms and inject data-driven practices that influence how newsworkers understand and practice journalism. These ‘explicit interlopers’ (Holton & Belair-Gagnon, 2018) and ‘ancillary organizations’ (Lowrey et al., 2019) operate at the periphery of legacy news media organizations. We argue that these peripheral actors are influenced by traditional journalistic discourse and at the same time challenge and influence contemporary news production. Drawing from metajournalistic discourse theory (Carlson, 2016) and new institutional theory (Ryfe, 2017) we propose a conceptual model of news production that is defined through practitioners’ perceptions of data journalism, tempered by journalistic as well as civic organizational goals. The model explains how journalism is affected by peripheral actors, such as civic data journalists that extract and adopt traditional journalistic practices and in turn inject data-driven practices into traditional news organizations, modifying news production. The theoretical discussion is supported by interviews with independent data journalists (mainly project leaders and country representatives) of civic technology organizations in Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and South America.<br /><br />Keywords: Data journalism, Civic technology organizations, Journalistic discourse, Legacy news media, Peripheral actors<br /><br />References:<br /><br />Carlson, M.

In fact, the overall findings about reasons and effects of social media as a news source are often ambiguous. Against this background, we raise the question if it is appropriate to consider social media news use as a variable in this broad sense or if it is necessary to differentiate between different importance levels of social media within people’s news repertoires in order to allow meaningful statements? This article argues our findings give cause to differentiate between people who use social media as an additional news source amongst others and people who use them as their main or even as their only one source. A skewed distribution and very distinctive characteristics of people with different ascribed importance levels for social media as news source are too pronounced to be put in one basket. Valid assertions about determinants, reasons and effects of using social media platforms for news will make more sense by taken their position within people’s news repertoires into account.<\/i>\n","Abstract Body: Despite the prevalence of partisan channels for news, little is known about how selective exposure leads to encountering political difference on social media. This study employs survey data (N=1,489) to create an innovative approach to identifying people’s news media repertoires. The analysis explores the relationships between news use, selective exposure, discussion disagreement on social media, and network diversity on social media. Results reveal a detailed look at the interactions between technology, news, and political talk.\n","Abstract Body: Discussion on robust open science practices often focuses on dissemination of research findings and the sharing of ‘data’. This paper argues it is as important to debate rigorous open science practices for research design and execution. We consider how qualitative researchers may design their research to promote openness through an ongoing set of practices. To demonstrate how research may be designed to both promote openness and yield fresh insights into core concepts in communications research, we use some of the data from a 2019 digital ethnographic media consumption study conducted in regional Australia. A mixed methods approach was taken to gain three different perspectives on how 21 participants living in the regional Tasmanian city of Launceston used media content to inform themselves on an everyday basis. We demonstrate how the use of three perspectives allowed us to construct a deeper understanding of the poorly conceptualised notion of news avoidance. Our findings support evidence that people say they avoid news because it is “too negative”. Yet by studying media consumption within the context of everyday life we were able to determine that the participants that self-identified as news avoiders did often consume news from mainstream and alternative sources. We argue news avoidance is often a form of action, rather than inaction, that can be linked to distrust of mainstream news media and  political disenchantment. We conclude by discussing why the notion of ‘news’ needs re-considering in the complex 21<sup>st<\/sup> century digital media environment.<br />\n","Abstract Body: The present study examines 1) how different types of news repertoire are associated with political information efficacy, and 2) how perceived news overload mediates the relationship. The study revealed three distinct types of news repertoires: interpretive news repertoire, TV news repertoire, and social media news repertoire. Among the three types of news repertoire identified, those who consume news via interpretive news repertoire were found to have a higher level of political information efficacy, while the use of TV news and social media news repertoire did not show significant effects on the level of political information efficacy. Perceived news overload negatively mediated the link between all three types of news repertoires and political information efficacy. A two-wave original survey data was employed for analyses. Implications are discussed.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Entrepreneurial journalism and news startups have become a global phenomenon that shape the changing journalistic field. This study aims to explicate how these ‘explicit interlopers’ (Holton & Belair-Gagnon, 2018) and ‘ancillary organizations’ (Lowrey et al., 2019) operate within a hybrid journalistic culture and, by bringing about new ideas, practices, and principles, slowly reformulate the core of journalism. We argue that entrepreneurial organizations a) are influenced by traditional journalistic norms and values that fit their institutional understanding of news media, b) reject the norms and values that do not adhere to their institutional logics, and c) infuse their own journalistic norms that challenge and influence contemporary news production. Drawing from meta-journalistic discourse theory (Carlson, 2016), and new institutional theory (Ryfe, 2006, 2017), we aim to bring order into the concept of hybridity by looking at co-existing institutional logics expressed in the manifestos, principles and editorial policies of 16 entrepreneurial news startups from all around the world. The overarching research question driving this study is: how do journalism startups legitimate their adherence to traditional journalistic norms while at the same time justifying the need for new approaches? Through a two-step methodological approach we first identify the main norms, values and themes via a qualitative content analysis. In a second step we carry out a discourse analysis to investigate how the news outlets use these norms - which are a reflection of the logics driving their practices - as a performative discourse to persuade their users about the legitimacy of their actions. Looking at entrepreneurial news startups and their legitimation strategies allows us to capture the institutionalization of journalistic change as it occurs.\n","Abstract Body: This case study in progress examines the sustainability of hyperlocal news production under a franchise model. Hyperlocal journalism is generally defined as news pertaining to a narrowly defined geographic area, such as a neighborhood or a postal code, or sometimes a topic (Kurpius, Metzgar, & Rowley, 2010). While hyperlocal news organizations often have low startup costs, and can help fill information vacuums following the closure or scaling back of other local news organizations, they struggle to become sustainable. Given the reliance of most hyperlocal news organizations on advertising, but also their limited geographic reach, “it’s hard to reach beyond local mom-and-pop advertisers to the larger retailers and car dealers who can pay the bills” (Craft & Davis, 2016, p. 120). Although studies of hyperlocal news organizations are often U.S. based, research on European sites has identified similar challenges to sustainability (Cook, Geels, & Bakker, 2016; van Kerkhoven & Bakker, 2014).<br />Hyperlocal networks have attempted to address the sustainability challenge by pitching regional and national advertisers across multiple sites. Patch, for instance, operates sites in more than 1200 communities, and courting regional and national advertisers has been part of its core strategy (Marshall, 2016). However, critics have pointed out that Patch content is often lacking. Journalists are not always physically located in the communities they serve, and stories rely heavily on official sources, offer little engagement with readers, and use linking strategies that aim to keep readers on their sites rather than send them to more relevant information on other websites (St. John, Johnson & Nah, 2014).<br /> <br />A franchise model: the case of TAPInto<br /> <br />TAPinto is a network of hyperlocal news sites located primarily in New Jersey. Originally called The Alternative Press, the company began in 2008 in three towns. CEO and founder Michael Shapiro gradually expanded the network and, in 2012, began recruiting other potential publishers to launch sites in other communities. The company adopted a franchise model in 2013 and became known as TAPInto. By the end of 2018, TAPInto had grown to 77 sites: 68 in New Jersey, six in New York, and one each in Florida, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina.<br />Most TAPInto sites become profitable in less than one year. Franchisee expenses include a $3,000 startup fee as well as an annual fee of $4,000-$7,000 for the right to operate one of the company’s branded news sites. The company manages billing for advertisers, and offers discounts on insurance as well as training on topics related to journalism, marketing, and advertising.<br />All TAPInto franchise revenue comes from advertising. While the sustainability of individual franchises largely depends on their attractiveness to local advertisers, franchisees also have help. Franchisees keep 90 percent of their own advertising sales, while TAPInto corporate receives the other 10 percent. However, other franchisees may also sell ads on their behalf. This may happen if an advertiser, such as a restaurant chain, draws customers from multiple TAPInto communities. TAPInto’s corporate office also tries to attract national and regional contracts for advertising across all or most sites in the network. As a result, TAPInto franchisees receive an average of $10,000 annually from ads sold by others. In other words, franchisees have the potential to break even, or come close to it, without having to sell their own ads.<br />Given the challenges of sustaining hyperlocal news operations, this study examines the following research questions:<br /> <br />RQ1: Can a franchise model sustain hyperlocal news operations?<br />RQ2: What conditions favor sustainability for hyperlocal news operations under a franchise model?<br />RQ2a: What are the professional backgrounds and traits of successful franchisees?<br />RQ2b: What are the characteristics of communities where sustainable franchises operate?<br /> <br />Methodology<br /> <br />Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 of the 76 TAPInto franchisees (21 percent) listed on TAPInto’s directory as of July 2019. This project received Institutional Review Board approval to conduct and audio record the interviews. Interviewees were promised confidentiality as part of the informed consent process. Twelve interviews were conducted in person. Four interviews were conducted over the phone due to scheduling difficulties. All interviews were conducted in July and August 2019. Preliminary coding of the interviews conducted for this study has begun. We anticipate gathering additional interviews with additional parties, including Shapiro, as well as gathering other data, such as corporate documents and demographic information about TAPInto communities.<br /> <br />Preliminary findings<br /> <br />All TAPInto franchisees interviewed said their businesses were profitable, and that it had not taken long to achieve profitability. However, few franchisees considered their operations profitable enough to provide a living wage for themselves. Rather, most franchisees said they had other sources of income and considered TAPInto part-time work, even as it may require full-time hours.<br />Franchisees generally believed that, although it was possible to break even within the first year of operations, attracting sustainable revenue took longer. Franchises had been in operation longer were often more profitable. However, franchisees also identified other factors they believed contributed to sustainability, such as their own professional backgrounds and personalities, and characteristics of the communities in which they operated.<br />The professional backgrounds of franchisees varied. Roughly one-quarter had journalism experience; another 17 percent had backgrounds in other types of communications, such as public relations. Other franchisees had experience in other fields such as politics, finance, accounting, real estate, community-based non-profits.<br />Consistent with studies (e.g., Napoli, Stonbely, McCullough, & Renninger, 2015) that have raised concerns about local news access in lower income communities, sustainable TAPInto franchises tended to operate in affluent communities. However, there were some exceptions, and franchisees indicated that other factors played a role as well, including competition from other news organizations and the presence of community activism. Once additional data is gathered, we will analyze which factors are most important to franchise sustainability.<br /> <br />References<br /> <br />Cook, C. E., Geels, K., & Bakker, P. (2016).

The emergence of blockchain and crypto-economics has led some journalists and industry analysts to claim these blockchain-based solutions are bringing decentralized governance and transforming business models for journalism. Despite the celebration of blockchain's capacities, much of the discussion about the potential benefits is hypothetical and lacks substantial evidence about what has been achieved using the technology. To explain and clarify the discursive strategies of the conversation, this study deploys qualitative content analysis to examine publications about CVL tokens and the underlying platform Civil from news providers and trade publications.\n","Abstract Body: <br />This paper offers a preliminary inquiry into platform companies’ digital subscription services as they are rolled out and evolve. During 2019, hundreds of newspapers and magazines in the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom signed for the Apple News+ service alone (Tobbit, 2019). The paper explores digital subscription services offered by Apple, Facebook and Google. The overarching aim of the research is to examine how the reader revenue market – digital subscription market - is being shaped by platforms’ news subscription services as some news publishers opt-in and others opt-out of these services. Additionally, the paper aims to examine to which extent these services aid or hinder news publishers’ revenue, and whether these services add to news publishers platform dependency. When aiming to answer these questions, the paper investigates platforms’ subscription service models; participators; pricing; revenue sharing arraignments; and platform subscription numbers. The research is based on document analysis as it utilises industry reports, academic papers, media reports and corporate documents as its source. As platform subscription services are evolving, hard facts and quantifiable data are hard to come by. The paper utilises attention economy as its contextual framework, as “we cannot understand monetary relations between platforms and news companies without considering attention” (Author, forthcoming).” Wu also points out, both media businesses and platforms “rely solely on the resale of attention to make money” (Wu, 2017, 18).<br />Platforms are fundamentally affecting how the journalism is funded, yet journalism studies lack in the research on how underlying structural changes impact news business models (Nielsen, 2018). Journalism has become entwined with the platform ecosystem as news companies continue to distribute and market their content on platforms, and to harvest and monetise users’ attention via platforms. Therefore it is paramount to understand the complex monetary relations of news companies and platforms. Earlier academic studies have warned that platform news distribution has created an imbalance and asymmetry of power between platforms and publishers, and that news publishers have become dangerously dependent on platform companies (Bell 2016; Cornia et al., 2018; Ekström & Westlund, 2019; Myllylahti, 2018, Newman, 2011; Nielsen & Ganter, 2018; Piechota, 2016).<br />At the same time as news publishers have increased their marketing efforts to gain digital subscriptions, platforms have launched their subscription services to gain a proportion of the news publishers’ reader revenue. Newman notes that “subscription-based publishers are increasingly looking at social media as a marketing and acquisition channel, not primarily as a place to engage users with content” (Newman, 2019, 18). While news publishers willingly sign for platforms’ subscription services, they potentially increase their platform dependency and add to their financial vulnerability.<br />In its digital platform inquiry, the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) describes Google and Facebook as ‘unavoidable business partners’ of news companies. However, it notes that “Google and Facebook each appear to be more important to the major news media businesses than any one news media business is to Google or Facebook”, indicating asymmetry between ‘business partners’ (ACCC, 2019, 16). A recent survey by the International News Media Association (INMA) observes that increasing number of news publishers are unhappy with their relationship with digital platforms, and the reason for deterioration in their relationship is clear: “monetisation is getting tougher whether the publisher is working with, against, or around digital platforms” (Whitehead, 2019, 7).<br />As audiences keep shifting from platform to platform, monetising on platform users’ attention becomes ever more challenging, and the opportunities they offer, keeps changing. Chua and Westlund (2019) argue that news publishers have started to counterbalance platform power by reducing their dependency on them. Newman also notes that “the news industry is losing patience with Facebook and publishers are re-focusing attention elsewhere” (2019, 5). However, recent developments point to an increasing interdependency. For example, during 2019 Facebook was preparing to launch Facebook News Tab which will display publishers’ headlines and article previews, for compensation. Although in September it was reported that the platform company would only pay a handful of publishes for their content (Aycock, 2019).<br />In a survey conducted by Newman, 43% of news publishers considered Apple News as important platform for audience attention and traffic as Facebook (2019, 17). In its report, ACCC noted that the rapid increases in Apple News usage in Australia “may result in Apple becoming a ‘must have’ platform for Australian media businesses” (2019, 208), and warned that the introduction of Apple News+ in Australia “may further increase the importance of Apple’s position in the supply of news referral services and consequently, its bargaining power relative to media businesses” (2019, 221). While commenting on Apple News+, News Corp chief executive Robert Thompson said that “Apple has acted positively, honourably and decisively to change the digital landscape, while other gatekeepers, such as Google, prefer hype and hypocrisy” (News Corp, 2019).<br />In this context, this paper investigates platforms’ subscription services, including Apple News+ which launched in March 2019 in the United States and Canada, and was rolled later in Australia and the United Kingdom. Google launched its ‘Subscribe with Google’ service in 2018, and Facebook its subscriptions via Instant Articles in 2017. The early findings indicate that some news publishers have gained substantial traffic and new subscriptions via platform subscription services whereas others have not seen an uplift in subscriptions. The early findings also suggest that news publishers’ revenue sharing arrangements with platforms are hindering their own reader revenue, especially in the case of Apple News+. Publishers, including Schibsted, have criticised Apple’s revenue sharing arrangements, and some report that their revenue from Apple is “one twentieth of what Apple promised” (Clover, 2019).\n","Abstracts: “French revolution is getting decimated by digital revolution”, rued a leading German journalist in a private conversation, voicing an anxiety that has gripped liberal voices lately. In her view, values of liberty, freedom and emancipation – established after so much struggle and with much historical weight – are now blown away by hate and lies of digital revolution favoring the far-right. The journalist’s remark might be seen as symptomatic of “liberal lamentation” about digitally powered right-wing shift of political cultures. It stands in contrast to an influential strand of analysis that characterizes far-right movements as “regressive rancor”. Scholarship in this strand links auto-victimization and backbiting revenge of Nietzchean ressentiment to the neoliberal turn in the economy – a real crisis that has driven large number of people out of jobs, welfare, and livelihood options. Important as they are, the two divergent critiques do not account for the variations wrought by uneven liberalization around the world, nor do they recognize that the perceived crisis of disappearing French revolution values is but a specific account of a specific culture that gives short shrift to colonial aggression that accompanied the very historical moment it celebrates. Above all, affective intensities of ressentiment attach very well to imaginary wounds that reaffirm historically continuous privilege and entitlement rather than as a response to actual conditions of systemic economic inequalities. As for the multiple effects of uneven liberalization around the world, cases abound where exclusionary Internet speech has little to do with economic deprivation. This paper suggests that these multiple pathways of exclusionary politics have paradoxically converged as a conjuncture on a global scale. With “online extreme speech” as a theoretical window (Udupa & Pohjonen, 2019; Udupa, Gagliardone & Hervik, forthcoming; Udupa 2017), the paper probes the nature and contours of this conjuncture. It suggests that digital media affordances might be seen as a connective tissue with specific affective infrastructures, foremost of “fun”. In advancing this argument, the paper critically engages with the “post-digital” thesis (Fielitz and Thurston 2019), and instead proposes a decolonial move that foregrounds multiple contexts and grave historical continuities that lie behind online extreme speech.\n",null,null,"Abstracts: There is a vibrant research literature in political science—specifically, in the sub-field of electoral studies—that analyses whether politicians’ personal image can influence voters in their political attitudes and behaviour. Meanwhile, in the public diplomacy literature, the role of political leaders—as a strategic means of influencing (international) public opinion—remains largely unexplored. In particular, it is unclear to what extent governments can employ their leaders as storytelling devices to develop strategic narratives about themselves. To address this gap, our paper brings image priming theory into the study of public diplomacy, exploring whether global audiences can, through visual images of state leaders, be primed to view international politics through a certain narrative lens—a narrative lens that generates soft power for the sender. We investigate this question through an analysis of photographs of Kim Jong-un distributed to international audiences by the North Korean propaganda machine. Our research design relies on a rigorous survey experiment (N=800) that tests whether US citizens take on more positive views of North Korea when exposed to photographic images of Kim Jong-un.\n","Abstract Body: Grounded in the theoretical frameworks of the organization–public relationships model and the situational theory of problem solving, this study proposed and empirically tested a model to examine the effects of employees’ perceived symmetrical communication on their perceived relationships with their organization and how these relationships influenced their communication behaviors on social media. This study conducted a national survey of 449 employees working at large organizations in the United States and found that symmetrical communication positively influenced organization-employee relationships (OERs), which had a positive impact on employees’ information seeking, processing, and sharing on social media. Furthermore, employees’ position level negatively moderated the relationship between symmetrical communication and OERs, with employees holding a lower-level position exhibiting a stronger relationship. The theoretical and practical implications of this study were also discussed.\n","Abstracts: This presentation explores practical and theoretical tensions around the use of algorithms in news organizations, and the implications that those changes hold. As ethical actors, journalists prioritize being transparent and open with their audience, and public relations professionals maintain credibility through being their best source of information. Therefore, ideal journalists should be transparent about their use of algorithms in their data gathering and use of public relations sources and data, just as they should be able to critique and explain other uses of algorithms of interest to the publics they serve. That said, algorithms can also be used to gain a competitive business advantage for news organizations. The ethics of media relations specialists, in a Kantian deontology framework, offer a duty to disclose how algorithms are used in targeting stakeholders, publics, and media outlets in public relations activities. We discuss how news organizations can balance competing motivations in a way that does not compromise public trust, maintains an ethical role for the 4<sup>th<\/sup> estate or “watchdog” function in society, and how public relations professionals can maintain moral duties to stakeholders and the public, in an algorithmic-data driven environment.\n","Abstracts: Most of contemporary debates on artificial intelligence (AI) concern the capabilities and applicability of these technologies across different areas as well as their impact on social relations and on ethical, security and privacy matters. Among strategic communication professionals there is an increasing preoccupation on how AI may sway the profession’s future skills and function in organizations. Could a machine be a person? Could a machine replace strategic communicators’ role in organizations? Often such discussion is veiled by preoccupation about the possible loss of organizational relevance as a result of an increasing AI adoption. Such preoccupation, the panel contribution argues, deserves to be addressed by reflecting on AI agency and the role of strategic communicators. Accordingly, emancipative view of strategic communication on the nature of AI agency is advanced, based on the idea of the “produser” (Bruns, 2007), and proposing an alternative, emotion-based vision on the function of strategic communication.\n","Abstracts: In this panel contribution, we explore how the proliferation of new decision-making algorithms reshape perceptions and processes of organizational responsibility. Specifically, we focus on three main dimensions. First, on a constitutional level, we explore shifting notions of agency, i.e., questions around whether or not algorithms are framed as agents in their own right, and the consequences for responsibility attributions. Second, we explore how algorithmic agency reorganizes human behaviour in organizational settings. Finally, we close our exploration with a view of how the proliferation of self-learning decision-making algorithms bears on societal processes for organizational accountability (cf. Buhmann et al., 2019). Specifically, this dimension addresses how the opacity and fluidity (i.e. poor transparency/comprehensibility) of abstract, self-governed algorithms, reshapes established mechanisms between account-givers and -holders, putting greater emphasis on stakeholder engagement and dialogue to work towards legitimation.\n",null,null,"Abstract Body: Previous studies showed that photographs in political news can be used for framing, but in these cases, images were isolated or supplementary to text. Realistically, considering them separately is difficult.<br />A 2x2x2 between-subjects factorial design experiment was conducted to examine the independent and conjunctive role played by text and image in news articles. It investigated how readers perceive them and use the information to evaluate a political candidate and make voting decisions.<br />Results showed that images were not just supplementary and that shared partisanship with the candidate influences the significance of text or image on readers’ responses. Moreover, their interaction effect was commensurate with their individual effects when provided simultaneously. An incongruently-valenced article invoked, no matter the shared partisanship, unfavorable responses comparable to those invoked by a congruently-valenced article with negative text and image. Thus, changing the valence of an article’s picture can be a subtle but strong framing strategy.\n",null,"Abstracts: This paper discusses ‘pioneer journalism’ as a principal force in the re-figuration of journalism and its organizational foundations. We understand pioneer journalism to encompass new forms of practice that are dedicated to redefining the field. This includes journalism from established media organizations and startups, journalism supported by accelerators, or journalism pursued by individual pioneers. Pioneer journalism aims to establish new figurations for production and distribution in which media and digital technologies play a crucial role. As our preliminary research demonstrates, there exists a loose network across the entirety of this phenomenon, a network that has the potential to form the basis of a journalistic pioneer community. With this in mind, our paper presents a map of German pioneer journalists (within established news organizations and start-ups, and work done by individuals) and discusses the role pioneer journalism plays in the re-figuration of journalism’s organizational foundations.\n",null,null,null,null,null,null,"Abstract Body: Foreign pornography has long occupied Taiwan’s local explicit material market. Drawing on the mediation theory, this study aims to identify and examine, in the global and Internet era, the power relationships between Taiwanese gay males and foreign gay male pornography. In order to achieve this goal, the present research utilizes qualitative discourse analysis to investigate gay pornography consumption in the most influential on-line sex issue forum LGBT_SEX (from 2011 to 2019). The results show that pornography from Japanese and Western countries is most frequently discussed in LGBT_SEX. Three orders of discourse were identified: Dichotomy between East and West, Foreign Dick as Symbol, and Common Sense of Being Gay. This research argues that although Taiwanese gay males display their agency on choosing pornography and expressing their experience or preference in terms of pornographic consumption, they confront the structural constraint of global capitalism and ideology of masculinity, which are mainly dominant in Western countries. However, the development of technology brings certain alternative solutions; hybrid homosexuality also exists in Taiwan society.<br /><br /><i>Keywords:<\/i> gay pornography, homosexuality, mediation theory, discourse analysis.\n","Abstract Body: The VH1 competition reality television program, RuPaul's Drag Race (RPDR) is increasingly finding audiences on a global scale. As commentators in the popular press have noted, the audience of the program appears largely split between gay men in their 20s to 40s on the one hand, and an increasing number of (mainly) young women on the other (Cracker, 2017). This presentation of work in progress will center on Finnish cisgender female fans of (RDPR) as part of a larger international collaborative project that combines data of interviews conducted in Finnish, and interviews conducted in English, Spanish, or French with cisgender gay men in large European cities, including Helsinki. The project also aims at bringing together two \"\"metadiscursive vocabularies\"\" (Craig, 1999): critical media studies and language and social interaction. For this presentation, we are particularly interested in the extent to which some of the distinctive linguistic features of RPDR get taken up in the context of the everyday lives of cisgender female Finnish fans of the show, analysed from the perspective of how their fan identities relate to their performances of gender.\n","Abstract Body: Cyberspace not only affords visibility to communities frequently marginalised by the societal mainstream but also has caused their discourse and visual images to explode. Starting as an Internet meme, a series of queer webcomies and hypermemetic images recently has gained popularity among Chinese queer community by visualising and categorising queer bodies in terms of both real animals and legendary creatures. For instance, “dragon” symbolises the sugar daddy, “shrimp” refers to the ugly with muscles, and “bear” means a heavy-set gay. By collecting online queer webcomies and related visual memes via digital ethnography, this paper has formed a digital archive to explore more nuanced conceptualisation of queer bodies in non-Western contexts. This paper first argues that by installing the idea of inhumanism and animality at the heart and discussing identities and proclivities according to Asian culture rather than entirely importing Anglo-American gay and lesbian stereotyped binarisms (such as top/bottom, butch/femme), such representation has revealed its own political promise: it challenges the Western queer identities as the default forms for anti-normativity. By pointing out this re-presentation, as a visual form of cultural resistance, can also be understood as a process of repositioning queer into a new animal world dominated by the law of the jungle, this paper then critiques that this re-ordering has literally led to another hierarchical order with new exclusion. By attending to feelings produced within this process of visualising, pigeonholing, and re-ordering, this paper concludes that replacing queer bodies on the animal continuum and repositioning them in a new order have triggered new forms of feelings related to lookism and classism among queer, such as hate towards obesity, fetish of muscle, and indifference to ugliness.\n","Abstract Body: During the summer of 2019, I traveled to a lakeside campground in the industrial Midwest with a “queer” fraternity. Over the course of four days, I took part in a series of activities designed to teach queer men (per the fraternity’s mission statement) how to “tackle shame with radical expression and untethered acceptance.” After we returned home, one of my new “sisters” wrote on Instagram (for his more than 200,000 followers) that the trip had healed him of “the heteronormativity and toxic masculinity that dominated American history and raised many of us.” Many of the conversations I took part in or listened in on throughout the weekend articulated similar sentiments. However, I would quickly find out that our healing was not the trip’s sole raison d’être. <br /><br />The fraternity is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that actively fundraises for its operations. Instagram plays a significant role in the fraternity’s branding and recruitment. Posts featuring individual members are written by the fraternity’s executive board members and the featured sisters, highlighting the qualities with which both the individual and the organization hope to brand themselves. Furthermore, corporate sponsors paid for our vacation, knowing that many of the sisters had large Instagram followings to whom they could promote and advertise their products through our representations of it on social media—a practice commonly referred to as sponsorship marketing. <br /><br />We were told on the first night that it was strongly encouraged to both create Instagram content usable by our corporate sponsors and for the purposes of the fraternity’s branding. While presumably it was more important for those with large Instagram followings to do this, everyone else joined in, often mimicking the style and aesthetic of those with larger and more engaged Instagram followings. Many times, individuals joked about how doing so would help them become “Insta-famous.” <br /><br />From all that I have gathered, occupying a visible and quantifiably superior position at the top of queer subculture’s Instagram hierarchy would endow the fraternity’s participants, as far as they understood it, with demonstrable proof that they had superseded the inferior position endowed upon them by heteronormativity and homonormativity. Such is an old tale, and one that has always undergirded in some way the aspiration to fame. However, what is alarming is that my study has revealed how popularized elements of queer ideology are compatible with neoliberal ideology—unmitigated self-expression, aesthetic oddity, individualism—and how queerness has been reconfigured as the potential to increase one’s competitive advantage. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This research looks into the politics of sexuality and work in Blued, a gay social app company headquartered in Beijing. Based on ethnography and in-depth interviews with its workers, we found that some workers decided to come to the company because they believed that doing so could reconcile their private life as a gay man and their public profession. The CEO also repetitively articulated a connection between workers’ sexual identity, their recognition of the gay community, and their commitment to the company, transgressing the boundary between private and public. However, the boundary has not completely collapsed. At the corporate image level, Blued has downplayed its connection with sex and the queer community. At the individual level, workers have realized that their future career prospect depend not on their sexual identity but their skills and experiences. The case of Blued reveals a highly dynamic relationship between sexuality and professionalism, which sometimes reinforce each other and sometimes negate each other.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Given the recent changes in in law in India and increasing visibility of the Transgender movement and LGBT rights activism in general, this study explores contemporary discourse on identity of transgender people in India through data from a qualitative study conducted in 2016-17. Findings from 16 in-depth interviews with human rights activists, legal experts, representatives of NGOs/CBOs working on transgender issues from across India and FGDs with 20 transwomen in Delhi indicate that despite changes in laws and increasing LGBT activism rooted in human rights discourse, emphasizing fluidity of identities and self-identification, the dominant discourse and understanding of <i>Trans<\/i>-identity in contemporary India is very much rooted in a specific cultural understanding (namely <i>Hijra <\/i>identity) with a secondary medicalized discourse gaining ground.  These dominant discourses continue to shape, influence and limit the recognition and rights of the Transgender community in contemporary India.<br />\n","Abstract Body: Insights into the existence of counterpublic positions might effectively take the temperature on democracy, as it can tell us something about how sensitive it is to minority groups and communities outside of the mainstream, public conversations of the “majority”. Hence, investigating counterpublic positions, understood as neither present nor discussed in public spheres dominant discourse, in highly digital and mobile public spheres contributes insight into some of the social outcomes of mobile social media in the continuously fluid, unclear and complex reality of spheres making up society. Moreover, as the case for this study is chosen based on an observation of a possible silencing of non-binary gender realities as a binary transgender experience gains recognition, it provides illuminations of (lacking) ontological contests. This is particularly illuminated in how the representation and presence of transgender people in social spaces gaining importance in society seems to be reproducing stereotypical gender roles. The research question steering this study hence concerns how non-binary people in Norway use and experience the mobile social media Instagram, approaching <i>use<\/i> through in-depth interviews.<br /><br />Using Instagram and the Norwegian society as cases of emerging social media in societies facing a reality of “deep mediatization” (Hepp et al., 2018), the study hence aims to grasp the non-binary experiences in increasingly digital public spheres with a rise in recognition towards gender fluidity in the binary sense. This will give insight into the workings of emerging public spheres, in a perspective considering democratic performance in an egalitarian access-principle not only in formal terms (Fraser, 2010).<br /><br />Pilot-interviews with two Norwegian public trans men, seen as often participating in public debates regarding questions on gender heteronormativity, provides the preliminary material for the observation. Preliminary findings suggests that there might be a tendency of gender fluidity acceptance within a binary gender model, and that main mobile social media cultures works (re)productive of this tendency in maintaining classic stereotypical notions of “male” and “female”. Initially investigating the role of mobile social media for individuals that in one way or another are standing outside of the normative in society, and outside of the general, mainstream public spheres and conversations, this study has moved towards gaining insight into <i>non-binary<\/i> transgender experiences. While there has been an increase in attention and sensitivity to binary transgender experiences in the Norwegian public, there is seemingly a lack of attention to non-binary gender experiences.<br /><br />Counterpublics, defined differently by different scholars (e.g. Choi and Cho, 2017; Jackson, Bailey and Foucault Welles, 2018) have been shown to take advantage of possibilities provided by social media, in their aim of influencing society at large (e.g. Jenzen, 2017; Choi and Cho, 2017; Jackson, Bailey and Foucault Welles, 2018). But while research has focused on social media such as Twitter and Facebook, <i>mobile visual <\/i>social media has received relatively little attention. Moreover, as a case of such social media emerging, with the smartphone structure and use inherent to its nature, Instagram has been considered a place where “the reproduction of dominant ideologies” takes place to a large degree (Tiidenberg, 2015). In times where public spheres are rapidly permeated by digital spaces (Liao and Humphreys, 2015; Hepp et al., 2018), the logic of social media that has emerged (Klinger and Svensson, 2014), namely <i>attention<\/i> as an in-built and algorithmic driven currency, might lead these digital spaces to work differently than merely laying the grounds for “significant technological transformation” for “the subordinate” (Cavalcante, 2016, p. 113), or open previously closed “one-directional” doors to real influence (Salter, 2013). While social media cultures are created by individuals, within a social media logic (e.g. Klinger and Svensson, 2014, p. 8-9; van Dijck and Poell, 2013, p. 7), the reproduction of hegemony is not only possible due to human interactions and expressions, but might also be amplified due to how social media structures work. The latter typically facilitates echo chambers and filter bubbles (Pariser, 2011; Sunstein, 2002).<br /><br />While contributing to acceptance towards gender fluidity, this fluidity is still largely legitimate in a two-gender perspective, then. Hence, a prevailed limitation might exist for non-binary people in particular when the accepted transgender experience is the one concerned with “correction surgery”. Hence, in accepting and acknowledging the possibility of being “born in the wrong body” (actually the name of a Norwegian popular tv-show aiming to increase acceptance of transgender experiences), needing to move between the one gender to the other seen from the majorities perspective, the gender structure is maintained. Such requirements to exist within the binary, as either male or female, depicts problems to the otherwise liberating turns in societies where binary transgender people are recognized as subjects before the law (Harris, 2012). Moreover, this might be amplified if the dominant success narrative relating to transgender experiences and realities are traditional gender stereotypes, as mentioned something suggested by preliminary findings. Hence, this study takes on arenas important for democratic processes, being recognized as subjects before the law and society, in access-principle in both formal and real terms, using theory on counter public positions (e.g. Fraser, 2010; Negt and Kluge, 1974; Dicenzo, Delap and Ryan, 2011). This way it illuminates and investigates possibly limiting and excluding effects of hegemonic discourses, how mobile social media might enable or limit ontological contests in society.<br /><br />The study will gather interview material of non-binary gender experiences in the Norwegian public. Given its prominent role in the Norwegian media landscape (Moe & Bjørgan, 2019), and its reflection of an emerging kind of social space in increasingly digital and visually-oriented public spheres, Instagram is used as a case for departure during these interviews. The study will be based on a qualitative analysis of two to four in-depth interviews, using thematic analysis to approach the interview material systematically and in-depth. It will follow steps outlined for “identifying, analyzing and reporting patterns (themes) within data” (Braun & Clarke, 2016), along with theoretical perspectives drawn from public sphere theory and rhetorical theory (Hauser and Kjeldsen, 2010; Hauser, 1999). This study will thus take on a theoretical departure point focusing on counterpublic positions and current and emerging digital realities’ possibilities of both enabling change and reproduction of existing structures, hence carrying both liberating and limiting possibilities.\n","Abstract Body: Introduction<br /><br />The rise of the ‘alt-right’ has been documented across the world. Right-wing movements, in particular, appear to be gaining traction in certain countries with the election of Donald Trump in the USA and the popular vote for Brexit in the UK, as obvious examples (Main 2018; Michael 2017). Concurrently, social media has been harnessed by many right-wing groups as a communication platform and a tool to promote their ideologies. Marginalised groups, including those who identify as LGBTIQ+, have been targeted and ‘othered’ via the rhetoric and actions of alt-right proponents. This marginalisation appears to have moved from mainstream media, where it began and continues, to online media. This research aims to understand and examine dehumanising language and rhetoric within what could be identified as an alt-right community on social media (specifically on one forum of the social media platform Reddit), that targets those who identify as transgender.<br /><br />Literature Review<br /><br />An issue with defining the term alt-right is that it is not a structured organisation and lacks clearly defined boundaries. However, there have been attempts to provide definitions of the group for analysis. The first usage of the term <i>alternative right, <\/i>(later shortened to alt-right) was in a blog written by white supremacist Richard Spencer in 2008 (Southern Poverty Law Centre 2017). For Spencer, the term alt-right broadly describes various neo-reactionary groups focused on white-supremacy and white-nationalism (Southern Poverty Law Centre 2017). This definition places the alt-right in opposition to the conservative and neoliberal establishment present in western democracies. Spencer asserts that “Western civilisation” is undermined by “multiculturalism”, “political correctness” and “social justice” (Southern Poverty Law Centre 2017). The movement defined as the alt-right received mainstream attention in 2016 when far-right American news organisation <i>Breitbart <\/i>aligned itself with the movement by promoting think pieces supporting an alt-right ideology (Green 2017; Southern Poverty Law Centre 2017). Breitbart’s promotion of alt-right ideologies coincided with the organisation’s executive chairman Steve Bannon working as “Chief Strategist” for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign (Green 2017; Southern Poverty Law Centre 2017).<br /><br />Dehumanisation of marginalised groups has been a common practice throughout history. Dehumanisation in media represents a selected group of people in a way that denies the complexity and agency of the individual members of that group (Armoudian 2015; Bandura 1999; Bandura, Underwood and Fromson 1975; Fasoli et. al 2015; Huot et. al 2015; Riggo 2018). The dehumanised group is referred to as the “other” or the “out-group” (Armoudian 2015; Bandura 1999; Bandura, Underwood and Fromson 1975; Fasoli et. al 2015; Huot et. al 2015; Riggo 2018). The group that is defined as being apart from the “out-group” is defined as the “in-group” (Armoudian 2015; Bandura 1999; Bandura, Underwood and Fromson 1975; Fasoli et. al 2015; Huot et. al 2015; Riggo 2018). By framing populations as an “other”, dehumanisation in turn frames discourse on this group in overly simplistic terms (Armoudian 2015; Bandura 1999; Bandura, Underwood and Fromson 1975; Fasoli et. al 2015; Huot et. al 2015; Riggo 2018). Historical examples exist of entire communities being framed via dehumanisation simply as a problem group that represents a danger to the “in-group”.<br /><br />One social media forum known for being a place for right-wing and alt-right proponents is Reddit (Robards 2018b). Reddit is a privately run social media aggregation website owned by its CEO and co-creator Steve Huffman. The website allows users to submit posts/content to forum pages. Specific community-led forums (known as subreddits) are created by individual users and are dedicated to particular communities (Massanari 2017; Robards 2018a). While Reddit is known for being male-dominated and for its reactionary communities (Robards 2018b), not all subreddits are reactionary. For example, r/Music is dedicated to exploring popular music (Massanari 2017; Robards 2018a). However, Reddit’s reputation for being an alt-right forum was highlighted this year when its popular subreddit, r/The_Donald, (dedicated to supporting Donald Trump) was ‘quarantined’ because of repeated ‘misbehaviour’, including inciting violence (Roberston 2019). On any given subreddit, a visitor will find “posts” submitted by users of the subreddit (Massanari 2017; Robards 2018a). These posts will contain a page with an “original post” which will be an image, link to another web-page or a caption (Massanari 2017; Robards 2018a). The post will also be accompanied by a comment section where other subreddit members/visitors can comment on the original post (Massanari 2017; Robards 2018a). Anyone can sign up to Reddit with a username and password and access all publicly available content (Massanari 2017; Robards 2018b). Users can link their Reddit account to an email account but are not obligated to do so (Massanari 2017; Robards 2018a). There are no identifying elements of a person in a Reddit account, unless they choose to include identifying features in their personal biography (Massanari 2017; Robards 2018a). As such, Reddit users can choose to be completely anonymous on Reddit’s public forum (Massanari 2017; Robards 2018a).<br /><br /><br />Methodology<br /><br />By applying an analytical framework for identifying dehumanisation, this research provides a textual analysis of the apparently alt-right Reddit online forum, r/It’sAFetish. r/It’sAFetish is a subreddit forum for those who identify as transgender exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs), a group that argues against transgenderism. TERFs have been shown in previous research to have strong affiliations with reactionary groups such as the alt-right. r/It’sA Fetish users generally have the view that transgenderism is a fetish that harms women. This textual analysis comprised a data-set of 16 posts and 420 comments from r/It’sAFetish to examine how message posts dehumanise the transgender community directly as well as via more subtle rhetorical strategies.<br /><br />The forum chosen for analysis can be understood as part of the alt-right community because of its adoption of alt-right rhetoric. The forum titled r/It’sAFetish is dedicated to discrediting gender theory, queer theory and gender theory through the lens of feminism. r/It’sAFetish identifies itself in its introductory bio as a space for “gender critical” transgender-exclusionary radical feminism. This may seem counter-intuitive to studying the alt-right given the subreddit’s identity as a “radical feminist” space. However, gender critical feminism has a noted history of holding reactionary views towards issues of gender, women and the queer community (Parke 2016). Gender critical feminists have worked in tandem with far-right religious/traditionalist groups, often providing a “feminist” face for transphobia. Notably, supporters of anti-transgender legislation have relied on gender critical feminists to reframe cisgendered women as victims of legislation relating to transgender people.<br /><br />This research utilised an analytical framework based on the approach of Huot et. al (2015) specifically to identify dehumanisation. By applying Huot et al’s framework, the research ascertains that dehumanisation of transgender people was present and common in r/It’sAFetish. The methodology of this research provides an approach to a problem inherent in researching online communities, decontextualisation. Researchers Crosset, Tanner and Campana (2018, p. 942) define decontextualisation as a process of information “being dissociated from its primary sources”. Decontextualisation can also be viewed as the removal of context-relevant signifiers in cross-community media. The textual analysis undertaken for this research worked to recontextualise particular content and posts, mainly to better understand the original context in which such content was posted.<br /><br />Findings<br /><br />The re-contextualisation of the content analysed revealed the highly selective re-posting practices undertaken by r/It’sAFetish users to support certain viewpoints or arguments. By closely examining the data-set the observation was made that r/It’sAFetish normalised the dehumanisation of transgender people using rhetoric that mirrored similar examples of reactionary groups throughout history. The digital ethnography methodology of this research provides a useful template for providing important context for analysing online subcultures, particularly those targeted at minority views or groups.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Armoudian, Maria. 2015. “Constructing “The Others” During Conflict: How Journalism’s Norms and Structure Tempers Extreme Portrayals.” <i>The International Journal of Press/Politics <\/i>20 No. 3 (March) 360-381.<br /><br />Bandura, Albert, Bill Underwood and Michael E.

While much academic research exists on the possible effects of pornography, most authors do not start by explicitly reporting their understanding of what constitutes sexual health or healthy sexual practices - including sexual consent - before testing an association between this understanding and pornography use. Using a definition of Healthy Sexual Development produced by McKee et al. (2010), our systematic review was informed by a Delphi panel of pornography research experts and found little pornography research that explicitly addressed sexual consent. There exists an extensive literature on the relationship between the consumption of pornography and sexual aggression/violence; however this work consistently fails to distinguish between consensual (kink, spanking, BDSM) and nonconsensual acts (sexual harassment and rape). We consider our findings as evidence of a persistent heteronormative approach to the study of pornography and we consider what this approach overlooks in relation to research understandings of pornography, sexual consent, and the relationship between these. We argue that pornography researchers need to recognise and respond to heteronormative understandings of pornography and its 'harms', as well as a need for more careful research into sexual consent and its relationship to pornography use. We found no agreement in the literature as to whether consumption of pornography is correlated with better or worse <i>understandings<\/i> or <i>practices<\/i> of sexual consent.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This project engages in a textual analysis of the Gay Cable Network’s “Sports Report,” which aired during its <i>Pride and Progress <\/i>news program (1984-2000). It attempts to better understand the history of LGBT media engagements with sports and sexuality at a time when mainstream images of the HIV/AIDS crisis influenced most discussions of the community. Within this line of reasoning the project shows the ways in which sports and the lesbian and gay community were thought together, or articulated (Hall, 1980), in an explicit manner that contradicted more mainstream, and heteronormative, representations of sports and the LGBT community.\n","Abstract Body: This paper examines the portrayal of the 19<sup>th<\/sup> century English landowner Anne Lister in the 2019 BBC/HBO drama <i>Gentleman Jack<\/i>, analyzing how this rarely seen depiction of female masculinity addresses the complex intersections of Lister’s sexuality and class positionality. <i>GJ<\/i> underscores the singularities of Lister’s romantic pursuits of women and business activities, both of which were normatively the domain of men. Furthermore, Lister’s “gentlemanly” ways are dramatized on the series in various instances of gallantry with her love interests, practices discussed about other masculine women with specifically classed, “knight”-like queer subjectivities. However, with the real-life Lister’s position within the landed gentry in tension with the marginality of her female masculinity, <i>GJ<\/i>’s depiction of Lister foregrounds her queerness as groundbreaking while downplaying the problematic ways she exercised her class and race privileges.\n","Abstract Body: This essay brings to light how cultural nuances around emotional attachment within the sociopolitical context of colonialism, postcolonialism, and homophobic violence in Ghana influence the formation of particular queer bonds that do not rely on queer identitarian politics as a precondition for relational intimacy. In parts of Africa, relational bonds and expressions of same-sex emotional intimacies have been the site of colonial scrutiny, regulation, and debasement. Therefore, I use personal narratives to explore what I term, Sasso relationality– a form of same-sex intimate bond that offers possibilities for re-articulating the dimensions of emotional and affective attachments between same-sex sexual subjects in West Africa.\n","Abstracts: This paper is based on a larger book project involving in-depth interviews with 69 dating app users living in a city in South China. When I spoke with my queer male informants, I quickly realized a phenomenon that has been less prevalent among other groups of informants. It was the constant deleting and installing of the same app. In this paper, I turn to the affective aspect of dating app use. Emotions move people. They push people closer to some things and pull them away from other things. I argue that the cycle of deleting and installing is a manifestation of the contradictory affects my informants had in relation to their experiences with dating apps. I differentiate two types of emotion. In-app emotions are directly derived from the everyday use of dating apps. Out-of-app emotions are rooted primarily in the way male homosexuality is treated in contemporary Chinese society. I show how the everyday use of dating apps and contemporary queer politics have generated both positive and negative emotions related to dating app use.<br />\n","Abstracts: Vibrant LGBT communities reside in big cities of China. With the rapid development of digital media technologies in the past decade, the informational and social activities of sexual minorities are increasingly mediated by platforms such as Tieba, QQ, WeChat, Weibo, Douban, Bilibili, and TikTok. Another cluster of LGBT-specific platforms, including Rela, Blued, and Aloha, also see their user bases expand. This paper uses an analytical approach informed by the traditions of urban ecology and media ecology and investigates the emergence of a digital queer space facilitated by these media platforms. A case study of Beijing LGBT communities is presented with qualitative data gathered from in-depth interviews and participant observation with community organizations, niche media outlets, and LGBT-identified individuals. It is found that digital networks, while enabling information exchange and virtual encounters among LGBT communities, do not eliminate the material constraints of urban space. The digital queer space is attached to and immersed in physical facilities. A key utility of digital media is to create and manage connections to those facilities. However, due to geographical and demographical segregation, the digital queer space is rife with ecological as many disconnections as connections. LGBT visibility and sociality are channeled through these dis/connections.<br />\n","Abstracts: Cross-dressing performance on short video platforms like TikTok and Kuaishou gained popularity in China in recent years. Some top-ranking male vloggers would disguise themselves as women, wearing wigs and referring themselves with female pronouns. Despite the potentiality of queer gender representation, such performance features what Judith Butler calls “secondary imitation,” which is premised on the normalization of gender binary and the intelligibility of a person’s “real gender.” Informed by queer theories of gender and performativity, this study presents a qualitative textual analysis of crossdressing short videos produced by male vloggers. While these videos are recognized as a demonstration of openness toward queer culture and gender fluidity among some audiences, they in fact perpetuate stereotypes of women and delegitimize non-binary spectrums of gender. It is also notable that the gender and sexual identity of the vloggers as cisgender man allows them the self-portrayal as the “standard” while imitating the “other.” Women are associated with negative characteristics that “make women women,” and men are positioned to have the power to “act out” those characteristics. Confirmative reactions from the audience further reinforce a heteropatriarchal cultural hegemony as embodied in the cross-dressing performance.\n","Abstracts: Despite its growing cultural influence in the world, Korea still remains largely intolerant to LGBTQ communities both legally and socially, even compared to its East Asian neighbors. Unsurprisingly, LGBTQ research in Korean communication context is lacking. I take a topographical, layered methodological and theoretical approach to explore Korea’s gay cultural landscape and discuss research considerations, drawing from field research data including 20 in-depth interviews with GBQ male dating app users in Seoul and conversations with Korea-based researchers. First, I navigate Korea’s everyday gay cultures through historical and emergent gay places, particularly focusing on digital cultures from enclave publics on social media, dating apps, and websites to increasing digital content such as YouTube videos and webtoons. Second, I aim to prompt discussion on culturally contextualized, reflexive research guidelines for navigating unique concerns and difficulties in conducting LGBTQ research in Korea. The contribution is twofold: 1) it provides practical, exploratory groundwork for researchers interested in Korean/comparative LGBTQ digital-scape, and 2) urges discussions on ethical LGBTQ research protocols for Korean and broader East Asian cultural contexts.\n",null,"Abstract Body: This research intends to adopt Mark Orbe’s (1998a, 1998b) Co-Cultural Theory as the theoretical framework to further explore how same-sex couples with children form their family identity by interacting and negotiating with the society as a whole. Specifically, the researcher aims to employ in-depth qualitative interviews (at least 3 times with each family) with 8 recruited gay and lesbian families within two years of time, in order to answer the following questions: how do the parents of same-sex families negotiate their nontraditional family identity with individuals and professionals in the external social settings? Throughout the process, what are the co-cultural orientations and strategies used by the same-sex parents? And finally, how do the individuals and professionals in the social settings respond to the same-sex parents’ co-cultural communication? The preliminary findings are suggested in this extended abstract. <br />\n","Abstract Body: This essay draws from two research studies to examine how considerations of marginalized identities—especially as they are enacted and embodied via social media—lend empirical support for a critical iteration of Communication Privacy Management (CPM) theory. In examining the online-enacted, privacy-oriented information turbulence that is often reported by White and Latino gay men in rural communities in the United States and Black trans women who reside in an urban setting in the U.S., it is apparent that critical attention both to power relations and assumptions regarding a public-private binary are needed for CPM theory. Such a re-centering allows for CPM to more-fully account for the privacy-related nuances experienced by those with marginalized identities. Drawing from multiple theoretical traditions and analysis of data from two research studies, Critical Communication Privacy Management (CCPM) theory is outlined, with special attention paid to the reliance many marginalized people report regarding their use of social media to find community, social support, and a sense of self. Future applications of the theory are also considered.\n","Abstracts: This paper considers how the role of hookup apps in platform ecosystems and app economies contributes to the commodification of queer cultural spaces, practices, and self-expression. It does so through an analysis of HER, an app for “queer womxn” and an international LGBTQ+ events company. This involves the walkthrough method, an approach for analyzing an app’s infrastructure and embedded cultural references, in combination with textual and visual analysis of HER’s Facebook event pages and associated linkages throughout its platform ecosystem. This analysis pays close attention to the app’s political economy, building on scholarship identifying hookup apps’ expansive branding as “lifestyle services.” Findings show how the app’s multi-sided business model and cultural discourses market idealized queer lifestyles through events, ambassador promotion, brand partnerships, merchandise, and premium app subscriptions. While this approach lends economic stability in a market rife with failed apps for women seeking women, the lifestyles it constructs perpetuate a generic, commodified vision of queer sociality based in Silicon Valley ideals. As other apps follow suit, expanding ambassador networks and event programming, these finding raise questions about how apps can instead support the aims and values of the local queer communities fueling their bottom line.    <br /><br />Keywords: queer women, dating apps, walkthrough method, LGBTQ+ social organizing, multi-sided markets<br /> <br />Bio: Stefanie Duguay is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Concordia University in Tiohtiá:ke/Montreal.

This paper presents findings from the Scrolling Beyond Binaries project, an Australian mixed-methods study that sought to understand how young (16-35) LGBTIQ+ people in Australia use digital social media. Drawing on a national survey (n=1304) and interviews (n=23), we explore how our participants used dating and hook-up apps such as Tinder, Grindr, Scruff, Her, Bumble and Happn as part of their everyday lives. While finding dates and sex was an important aspect of use, we attend to what Albury and Byron (2016) describe as ‘off-label’ uses such as finding and communicating with friends, feeling part of a sense of a ‘community’, and being visible. We also examine experiences of rejection and exclusion on dating and hook-up apps, where our data reveal themes around discrimination, and feeling invisible, ignored, and alone.<br /><br />Keywords: community, dating apps, friendship, gender, LGBTIQ+, queer, sexuality<br /><br />Bio: Brady Robards is a Senior Lecturer and ARC Senior Research Fellow in Sociology at Monash University.

A significant body of literature exists exploring LGBTQ+ men’s sexual health in relation to dating app culture. In contrast, LGBTQ+ women and non-binary people’s experiences of negotiating sexual health are underrepresented. This paper reflects on strategies our participants deployed in order to feel ‘safer’ in dating app cultures. The majority of female-identified and non-binary people were relatively confident in their ability to negotiate personal safety in chat and offline meetings via a range of platform affordances - including ‘close readings’ of potential matches’ profiles to filter out unwanted contact, and the use of social media platforms such as Instagram for identity verification. There was less consensus regarding the role dating apps can or should play negotiating safer sex and consent. While some preferred ‘upfront’ disclosures, others found in-app sexual health negotiations confronting, problematic, or inappropriate. This suggests that as in other arenas where the notion of ‘safety’ is contested and not absolute (for example, in relation to safer sex), discussions of safer dating app use should account for the contexts in which differently sexed and gendered bodies might feel more or less safe.<br /><br />Keywords: sexual health, safety, mobile media, consent, social media.<br /><br />Bio: Kath Albury is Professor of Media and Communication at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne.

These findings illustrate that trans and nonbinary people use major dating apps to find lovers, make friends, and connect to their local trans and nonbinary community, by drawing on the geolocative aspects and visibility afforded by mobile dating apps. Additionally, participants described using mobile dating apps within a larger social media ecosystem to initiate and maintain connections with others, as participants often struggled to find inclusive public spaces to meet new people in person as a result of a rapid loss of queer space in Toronto. I conclude by discussing the importance of access to the social media ecosystem for marginalised groups like trans and nonbinary people, as well as the social and mental health implications of misgendering and invalidation in social apps like major mobile dating apps, and suggestions for further research in this field.<br /><br />Keywords: dating apps, trans and nonbinary people, community, social media<br /><br />Bio: Taylor Thompson is an undergraduate student studying in both the Anthropology and Book & Media Studies departments at the University of Toronto.

Using the concepts of Goffman's performativity, Walther's hyperpersonal, and Marwick's online identity, the paper looks at the types of self-presented selves, how hyperpersonal settings enable such selves, and why such presented selves/ identities thrive in the Philippine setting. A thematic analysis of the insights of the 30 queer informants revealed these categories of mobile sexual selves: a.) displaying the ideal self; b.) being an active individual through lifestyle; c.) censorship, due to social expectations; and d.) negotiating online spaces through the use of multiple platforms. Curation of the presented selves are enabled by the motives to be sexually engaged, the affordances of the hypersetting, and the socio-sociocultural and religious settings of the Philippines. The paper concludes that sexual presentations in mobile dating apps are co-created by the users' motives and dating culture, the apps' features, and the way the sexual conversations are shaped. The findings contribute to the literature of contextual and cultural mobile intimacy studies, particularly on mobile sexual communication practices and experiences.<br /><br />Keywords: self-presentation, mobile intimacy, young adult, queer, hyperpersonal communication<br /><br />Bio: Jonalou Labor is an associate professor at the Department of Communication Research of the U of the Philippines College of Mass Communication.

The embodied subject producing the profile — a bisexual woman — straddles the two dominant categories of sexuality encoded into the app: heterosexuality and homosexuality.  I aim to show how the limitations of the platform design and affordances shape the curation of a self-presentation which in fact, is not “stable” at all, but rather is experienced as teetering on the brink of two multistablities: not too queer for straight audiences, and not too straight for queen audiences.  The narrative contributes both to the application of post-phenomenology to the realm of social media studies, and aims to show a complex case that stretches Ihde’s original contemplations of Body One, Body Two, and the technologically-mediated and co-produced Body Three, all to show the importance of relational and sociotechnical narratives of intimate technological encounters.<br /> <br />Keywords: post-phenomenology, social media, embodiment, multistabilities, internet studies<br /><br />Bio: Katie Warfield is a distinguished scholar at Kwantlen University and a faculty member in the Department of Journalism and Communication.

An online survey among 282 college students was conducted and regression-based path models were applied to test a mediational model for social support on Facebook. The results indicated that computer-mediated communication competence was related to interpersonal motives to use Facebook, which were related to well-being, but only when mediated by perceived available social support. The results of this study have significant implications on designing communication interventions to help college students garner greater social support to improve health.\n",null]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>title<\/th>\n      <th>presenter<\/th>\n      <th>vimeo_link<\/th>\n      <th>abstract_authors<\/th>\n      <th>abstract_session_name<\/th>\n      <th>abstract_div<\/th>\n      <th>abstract_body<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"targets":[2,7],"render":"function(data, type, row, meta) {\nreturn type === 'display' && data != null && data.length > 50 ?\n'<span title=\"' + data + '\">' + data.substr(0, 50) + '...<\/span>' : data;\n}"},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false,"orderCellsTop":true}},"evals":["options.columnDefs.0.render"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
